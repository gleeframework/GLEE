(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a good price, it's still above my maximum budget. I want to see if I can negotiate a lower price with Alice. There are still 9 rounds left, giving me ample opportunity to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's closer to my target price but still leaves room for negotiation.  A $50,000 reduction from Alice's offer is significant and shows I'm serious about buying, but it's not so low that it's likely to be rejected outright."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still above my target. I can potentially do better with another counteroffer. I want to see if I can get closer to my budget before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, showing I'm willing to move closer to Alice's price, but still keeping it under my budget. This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to compromise while aiming for a price that's still favorable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now at $1,050,000. This is a good price, and I'm getting closer to my budget.  While I could potentially negotiate further, it's getting late in the game, and I don't want to risk Alice walking away or having to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting this offer secures the product for me at a reasonable price."
