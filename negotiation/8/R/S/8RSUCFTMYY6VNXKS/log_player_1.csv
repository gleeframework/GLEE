Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 11000} 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate. It also signals that I'm confident in the product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While $8,000 is better than nothing, I'm not willing to sell for that low. I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate.  $9,500 is a good compromise, and hopefully, Bob will see that it's a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

I'm still not happy with the price, but Bob's offer is closer to my minimum. I'll counteroffer once more to try and reach a compromise."

I'm lowering my price again, but I'm getting closer to my minimum. I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a fair price, and we can finalize the deal."
