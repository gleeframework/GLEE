"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a good deal compared to Alice's valuation, it's still above my maximum budget. I'm going to try to negotiate a lower price before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the deal, I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider $8,500? "", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8500 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9250?  I'm confident this price still represents a great value for you, while also allowing me to make a fair profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,250 is closer to my budget, it's still above what I'm willing to pay. I'll try to negotiate further to see if we can find a price closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,250 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? This would give us both a fair price. "", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8750 is still below my bottom line. I'm willing to come down to $9000. This is a fair price that considers both our needs. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my price point, I'm starting to run out of rounds.  It's highly unlikely she'll come down to $8,000.  John's offer is the safest option to guarantee a purchase within my budget."
