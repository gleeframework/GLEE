"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You are willing to pay up to $12,000, but $9,500 is still a significant amount above your ideal price.
* **Negotiation is possible.** You have 10 rounds, and you've already rejected Alice's initial offer, so you can try to negotiate a lower price. 
* **John's offer is a backup.** Knowing you can get the product from John for $12,000 provides leverage during negotiations with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:** My counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above her minimum value of $8,000. 
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer is meant to see how willing Alice is to negotiate.  
* **Leaving room for compromise:** I'm leaving room for negotiation,  as I'm still willing to pay more than Alice's minimum."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While lower than her initial offer, it's still above the price I'm aiming for.
* **More negotiation is possible.** We're only in round 3, meaning there are still opportunities to lower the price further.
* **John's offer provides a safety net.**  I can still buy from John for $12,000 if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:** I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly, showing Alice I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Strategic compromise:**  $9,000 is a good middle ground between my previous offer and Alice's offer.
* **Maintaining leverage:** While getting closer to Alice's desired price, I'm still leaving room for further negotiations before reaching my limit with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increasing offer slightly:**  I'm raising my counteroffer to show Alice I'm serious about closing the deal, but still keeping it below her previous offer. 
* **Testing for a breakthrough:**  This offer is a bit higher than my last one, so I'm seeing if this is the point where Alice might accept. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  I'm still below John's price, so if this is rejected, I still have room to negotiate further."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's getting closer to my limit, I'm still hoping to get a better price.
* **Time is running out, but not critical.** We have 4 rounds left.  I'm willing to risk a few more rejections to see if I can get a lower price.
* **John's offer is a safety net.** If this round doesn't go well, I can still buy from John and avoid a bad deal."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Last chance for a good deal:** This is my final serious offer. I'm pushing my price closer to Alice's last offer, but leaving some room for negotiation.
* **High-stakes counteroffer:** If this is rejected, I'm ready to move to John in the next round.
* **Time is limited:** With only 3 rounds left, I need to find common ground quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too close to my limit.** At $11,500, I'm only saving $500 from buying from John, which is not worth the risk.
* **Only one round left.** If I reject Alice's offer, I risk getting a worse deal in the final round, or being forced to accept a price closer to my limit.
* **John's offer is the safest option.**  Given the limited time and the close price difference, buying from John ensures I get the product within my budget and avoids further negotiation."
