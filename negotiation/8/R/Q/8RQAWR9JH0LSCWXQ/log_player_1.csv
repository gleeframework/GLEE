"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $175.  This is a bit above what I believe the product is worth to Bob, but it gives me room to negotiate and still get a good price.  It's also important to remember that if Bob rejects, I can always go to John and get my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $150.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to budge closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm going to counter with $160. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still higher than Bob's offer.  I'm hoping that this will encourage him to come up a little in his next offer, and we can get closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $140 is close to my minimum desired price of $150. It's a good deal for both of us, and I don't want to risk losing him as a buyer by continuing to negotiate."
