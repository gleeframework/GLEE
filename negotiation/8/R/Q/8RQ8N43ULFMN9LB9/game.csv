"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $5,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. I'm open to selling it for $9,000.  This price still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to the value I'm looking for. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  $9,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $6,500. Would that work for you?",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $6,500 is still too low. To make this work, how about we split the difference at $8,000? It's a fair compromise, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a good price. Let's try to finalize this deal!",8000.0,Alice,5,
