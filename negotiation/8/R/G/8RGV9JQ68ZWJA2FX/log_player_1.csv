Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant benefits it will bring to your [business/situation]. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's a negotiation. Starting with a price closer to your walk-away value ($1,200,000) gives you room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Justification:**  The message aims to justify the high price by emphasizing the ""value and potential"" the product offers Bob. 
* **Leaving Room:** The phrase ""initially proposing"" signals there's room for negotiation.
* **Alternative in Mind:** While the message doesn't mention John, you're aware of your backup offer. This knowledge gives you confidence in your negotiation with Bob. 

**Important:** This initial offer is designed to start the conversation. Be prepared to adjust your price based on Bob's response and any counter-offers he might make."
