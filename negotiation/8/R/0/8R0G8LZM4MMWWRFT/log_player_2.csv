"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $95 for it.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $95 is too high.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $95 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still within the range where both parties could potentially find a deal.  This counteroffer is a starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand where you're coming from. How about we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best deal possible.  While $90 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still more than Bob wants to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $90 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $87.50.  This is a fair price that allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 87.50} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price closer to his desired price point but still slightly higher than his previous counteroffer. This demonstrates his willingness to compromise while also ensuring he's not settling for a price that's too high."
