"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to make a profit, so I hope you can meet me in the middle.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product is valuable, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. I believe that's a fair offer considering my budget.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'll offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I need to make a profit.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming closer on the price. While $900,000 is better, it's still a little too high for my budget. Would you consider $700,000? I feel that's a reasonable compromise for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $850,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000. I hope you can meet me at this price.",850000.0,Alice,5,
