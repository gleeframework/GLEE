"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to make a profit, so I hope you can meet me in the middle.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $850,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000. I hope you can meet me at this price.

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is unlikely to go below $850,000. While she might budge a little more, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation. John offers a guaranteed price of $800,000, which is a better deal at this point.  It's time to cut negotiations with Alice and secure the product from John."
