"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm starting with a price of $95, which is slightly above Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my ideal outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $75.  While it's tempting, it falls below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of reaching a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm offering $85. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my minimum price.  It demonstrates flexibility while still ensuring I receive a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum acceptable price. While I'd like to get more, accepting this offer ensures I don't lose out on a sale. I'm also aware that I have the option to sell to John for $80, so accepting this offer makes sense from a risk/reward perspective."
