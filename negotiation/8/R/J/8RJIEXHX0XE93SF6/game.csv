"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is significantly higher. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $1500000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for it. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the potential value of the product to me. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1300000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1300000 is still slightly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1100000 as a final offer. This is the absolute maximum I can afford, and I'm confident it reflects the product's value. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1100000 is your maximum budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $1200000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value.
