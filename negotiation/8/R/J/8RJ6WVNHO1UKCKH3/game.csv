"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but your price is a little too high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I can offer you a compromise at $1,050,000, which is a $50,000 discount from my initial offer. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $950,000. Would that work for you?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer you $1,025,000, which is a $25,000 discount from my previous offer. I think it's a fair price that balances both our interests.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
