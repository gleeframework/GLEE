Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I'm anticipating, I'm offering it to you for $15,000."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, there's a chance to earn more from Bob.
* **Starting High:**  Beginning with a higher price ($15,000) leaves room for negotiation. Even if Bob counter-offers, you're still likely to land above your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Creating Urgency:** By mentioning other potential buyers and a limited-time offer, you incentivize Bob to make a decision quickly. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have some flexibility in your pricing and are comfortable with the possibility of Bob rejecting the initial offer."
