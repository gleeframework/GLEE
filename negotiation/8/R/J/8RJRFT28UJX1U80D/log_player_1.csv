Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than its true value for you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price, and I want to explore those options before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,000 just isn't quite there for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $9,500?  This price still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to my minimum. Let's try to find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet at $8800? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still a decent profit for me, and Bob is clearly pushing his own budget limits.  I don't want to risk losing this deal and having to sell to John for a lower price."
