"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's definitely worth trying to negotiate a lower price. There's a good chance Alice will be willing to come down to a price you're comfortable with, since she values the product at $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $1,000,000. This sets a clear boundary and signals my seriousness about getting a good deal.  While it's unlikely Alice will accept this offer immediately, it provides a starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my desired price point.  I believe there's still room for negotiation, particularly since Alice is likely motivated to sell the product given its lower value to her."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $1,200,000. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise but still want a good deal.  It's a reasonable middle ground, and hopefully, Alice will see it as a fair price given her lower valuation of the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is still too high for my budget. While it's possible we could continue to negotiate, it seems like we're getting stuck in a pattern. Given that I have the option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, it's the most sensible choice to avoid further negotiation and secure the product at a price I'm comfortable with."
