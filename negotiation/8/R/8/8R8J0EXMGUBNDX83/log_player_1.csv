Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is better than $8,000, I think I can still get closer to my desired price point of $11,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,000? I'm confident this is a price that works well for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. Although it's not my ideal price, it's getting closer to my target and is still a decent amount of money for me.  I'm also running out of rounds, and I don't want to risk ending up selling to John for $8,000."
