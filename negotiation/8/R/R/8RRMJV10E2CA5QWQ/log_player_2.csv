Bob is going to raise his offer to $11,000. It's still within his budget, but shows Alice he's serious about buying and is willing to compromise.  This should put them closer to finding a price they both agree on."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

Bob should accept Alice's offer. $13,000 is within his budget, and it's likely he won't be able to get a better price from Alice.  While John offers a cheaper price, Bob might be able to get a better product from Alice."
