Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $10,000, which reflects its true value."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal.
* **Justification:**  While a simple ""take it or leave it"" approach can work, providing a reason for your price can make Bob more receptive.  Phrases like ""true value"" or ""reflects its worth"" aim to frame the price as justified.
* **Alternative in Mind:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, so you can afford to be a bit bolder in your initial offer to Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can gradually lower your price, but ensure you don't go below your $8,000 minimum."
