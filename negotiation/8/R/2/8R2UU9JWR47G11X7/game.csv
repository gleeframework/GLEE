"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll love it!",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $18,000 is far above my budget.  Considering the product's worth to me, I'm willing to pay $8,500.  I believe this is a fair price given its value to both of us.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. Considering the product's value to you is $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $12,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth to me, and I think it's a fair price given our negotiations so far.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still outside my price range. I'm willing to pay $9,500. This offer is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it is a fair reflection of the value of this product for both of us. I hope we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. Considering the product's value to me is $15,000, I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair reflection of the product's value to both of us. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",11000.0,Alice,5,
