Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it extremely valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$15,000:** This is a starting point that is significantly higher than my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation. It allows me to potentially gain more than my minimum but still remain open to a reasonable counteroffer.
* **Message:**  This is a friendly and confident message that emphasizes the value of the product without revealing too much about my minimum price. It leaves the door open for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a good deal. 

**Why I chose this approach:**

* **Starting High:**  This sets the stage for negotiation and gives me leverage.
* **Leaving Room:** By not offering the minimum, I have room to accept a counteroffer if it's reasonable.
* **Focus on Value:** Highlighting the value of the product is more important than focusing on the price right away. 
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly approach can make Bob more receptive to the negotiation process. 

**Remember, this is just a starting point. I will need to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and how the negotiation progresses.**"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $12,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum value of $10,000. I am willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I will reject Bob's offer and try to counteroffer to secure a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While I value the product at a higher price, I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from the product.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I am offering a price of $13,000, which is halfway between my minimum value ($10,000) and Bob's offer ($12,000). This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Message:**  I acknowledge Bob's budget concerns and reiterate the value of the product to justify my counteroffer. This keeps the negotiation amicable and focused on finding a mutually beneficial outcome.

**Why I chose this approach:**

* **Compromise:** This demonstrates flexibility and shows Bob that I am willing to work with him.
* **Focus on Value:** I continue to highlight the value of the product to justify my counteroffer and potentially sway Bob.
* **Reasonable Offer:** The offer is a reasonable midpoint that leaves room for further negotiation if needed.

**Next Steps:**

I will wait for Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he accepts, I've secured a good price. If he rejects, I'll need to assess whether to lower my price further, make another counteroffer, or accept the deal with John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13000 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $11500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $11,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. While I would prefer to earn more, I am willing to accept this offer considering the following factors:

* **Negotiation Progress:** We've gone through multiple rounds, and it's clear that Bob's budget is a constraint.
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly higher price, and it could be time-consuming.
* **Alternative Offer:**  John's offer of $10,000 is a secure option, but Bob's offer is only slightly lower. 

In this situation, it's more beneficial to accept Bob's offer and finalize the deal, as it secures a price that is only slightly below my minimum and saves me time and effort compared to continuing the negotiation."
