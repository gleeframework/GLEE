Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Slightly below your minimum acceptable price:**  This gives you room to negotiate.
* **Above Bob's perceived value:**  It creates incentive for Bob to consider the offer.

However, be prepared to negotiate further if Bob rejects this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $9,500. Could you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price.  There's still potential to get closer to my target with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $10,250 isn't my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer and getting closer to my target price of $12,000.  At this point, I'm willing to accept Bob's offer and finalize the deal."
