"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth $8,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's still a good profit for me. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

While Alice claims the product is worth $8,000 to me, her offer of $12,000 is too high. I know I can get the product for a much better price from John ($8,000)."
