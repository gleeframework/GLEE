"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd be a great fit for it. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way above your budget. You should definitely try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant decrease from Alice's offer, but it leaves you room to negotiate upwards while staying well below your $80 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $60 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate. How about $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice came down a bit, but she's still at her maximum price. You should counter with an offer closer to your target, leaving room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I can appreciate that you're trying to find a fair price. I'm willing to increase my offer to $70, but that's about as high as I can go."",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

This counteroffer moves closer to your $80 limit while still leaving room for negotiation. It also signals to Alice that you're serious about buying but need a more competitive price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand where you're coming from. How about we meet in the middle at $85? That's a pretty significant discount from my original offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to your acceptable price, but you're still over your budget. There's no need to jump at this offer yet. You can try to negotiate a bit further or stick with your guaranteed option of buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, $85 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about $75?  That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

This counteroffer does a few things:

* **It's your best offer:** You're getting close to your limit, and this offer signals that. 
* **It introduces a sense of urgency:** Using ""final offer"" suggests that you're ready to walk away if Alice doesn't agree.
* **Leaves room for Alice to counter:** While firm, it's not an ultimatum, leaving open a small window for Alice to propose $80 if she's desperate to sell."
