Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I can appreciate that you're trying to find a fair price. I'm willing to increase my offer to $70, but that's about as high as I can go.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand where you're coming from. How about we meet in the middle at $85? That's a pretty significant discount from my original offer."", ""product_price"": 85}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $85 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about $75?  That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob has made it clear he's not willing to go much higher.  While I could continue negotiating, it's unlikely he'll reach $80, which is already less than my minimum. Selling to John for $100 guarantees I get a fair price."
