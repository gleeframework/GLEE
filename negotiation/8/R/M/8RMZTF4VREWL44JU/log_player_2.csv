"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than Alice's valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  There's room for negotiation to get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $8500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $10000? It's a fair compromise and a price that would allow me to move forward with the sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $10,000 is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  There's still room for negotiation to get a better price, especially since Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued effort to find a middle ground. While I value your willingness to compromise, $9000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $9500. This price is a fair compromise and would allow us both to finalize the transaction. Let me know what you think.

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000. While Alice has come down in price, her latest offer of $9,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Since John is offering the product at Bob's maximum, it's the most logical choice to avoid further negotiation and secure the product at the best possible price."
