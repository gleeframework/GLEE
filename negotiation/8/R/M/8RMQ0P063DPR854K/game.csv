"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. It's a fair price that allows both of us to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 doesn't quite cover my costs. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing for a good profit on your end and a reasonable return for me. Let's close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
