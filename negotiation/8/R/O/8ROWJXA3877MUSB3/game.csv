"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer and showing genuine interest. While $1,600,000 is a strong starting point, the value this product brings to the table, particularly in terms of its long-term benefits,  is considerably higher. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,900,000. I believe this price reflects the true worth of the product and presents a fair deal for both of us.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
