Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, hoping to get close to my minimum value. I know Bob values the product at $8,000, so I'm leaving room for negotiation. If he rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to counter-offer and move closer to his value, but I'll still aim to get the best possible price for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum than my initial offer, I still believe I can get a better price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $10,500. This is still above Bob's offer, but it's a more reasonable price, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. I'm hoping we can reach a deal at this price, as it's closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still below what I want.  Rather than continue negotiating and risk getting a lower price, I'm going to take the guaranteed $10,000 from John. It's a better outcome than risking a lower price with Bob."
