"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you. This item holds significant value for me, but considering its importance to you, I believe we can come to an arrangement that benefits both of us. I am offering the product to you for $9,500, which I believe strikes a fair balance between its worth and your valuation. I trust this price will allow you to secure this valuable asset without overextending your budget. Looking forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,500 is below your maximum budget, you know you have John as a backup option at $10,000.  There's a chance you can negotiate a better price with Alice or safely accept John's offer if Alice won't budge."
