"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my minimum price and still leaves you a healthy profit margin.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price still gives you a solid profit and is much closer to the value I need to achieve. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000. Can you consider this revised offer?",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $900,000.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $925,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and it's a price that I believe is fair for both of us. Let's aim for a swift resolution.",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to reach an agreement. I'm willing to make one final concession and offer you the product for $918,750. This is as low as I can go while still meeting my minimum requirements. If you're serious about acquiring the product, I suggest you accept this offer, as I'm not going to negotiate further.",918750.0,Alice,7,
