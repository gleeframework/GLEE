I reject Bob's offer because I believe the product is worth more than $1,000,000. I want to see if I can get a better price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}

I'm willing to lower my price slightly, but I still believe the product is worth at least $1,200,000."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low. While I could continue negotiating and risk getting a lower offer, I believe I'm better off selling to John for $1,000,000. This guarantees me a reasonable profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob."
