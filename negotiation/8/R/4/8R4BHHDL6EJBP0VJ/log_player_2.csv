It's way too expensive right now. Let's see if we can negotiate a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $7,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:

Let's see if we can get closer to my initial offer.  I'm still interested, but $8,500 is still a bit too high."
