"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $10,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for the product, considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find some middle ground.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $7,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value you're getting.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $8,500 is still above what I can comfortably afford. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,000? This would be a fair price for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,4,
