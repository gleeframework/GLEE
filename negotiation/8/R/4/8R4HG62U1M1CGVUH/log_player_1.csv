Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really enjoy it.  I'm asking $150 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($120) to leave room for negotiation. This gives me the best chance of maximizing profit. 
* **Friendly Approach:**  I'm using a friendly and open tone to encourage Bob to negotiate. 
* **Openness:**  I explicitly state I'm open to negotiation, inviting Bob to make a counteroffer. 
* **Keeping John in Mind:**  If Bob rejects my initial offer, I'll need to consider whether it's worth continuing to negotiate with him or taking the guaranteed $120 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Could we possibly negotiate the price down to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation or potentially losing the sale to John."
