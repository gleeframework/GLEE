Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? This would still be a great price for you, considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 9500}
