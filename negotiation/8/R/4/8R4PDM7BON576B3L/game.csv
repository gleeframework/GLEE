"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product.  However, $1,400,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, which is fair given its value to me.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, but the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true worth of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet halfway between our last offers, at $1,125,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to come to an agreement.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
