It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice and buy from John. Here's why:

* **Alice is unlikely to budge:** Alice knows your maximum is $1,000,000 and she consistently stays well above that price. 
* **Time is running out:** With only one round left, there's a high chance you won't reach an agreement with Alice.
* **Guaranteed savings:** John offers a guaranteed price of $1,000,000, saving you at least $450,000 compared to Alice's latest offer.

While there's a slim chance of getting the product for a bit less than John's price with Alice, the risk of ending up with nothing is too high."
