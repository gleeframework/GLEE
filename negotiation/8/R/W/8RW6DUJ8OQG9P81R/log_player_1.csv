Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,400,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate a bit higher, getting you closer to his maximum.
* **Above Your Minimum:** This offer is significantly above your minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000), ensuring a profitable sale. 

By setting a high but reasonable initial offer, you increase the chances of Bob accepting or countering with a price that's still very beneficial to you."
