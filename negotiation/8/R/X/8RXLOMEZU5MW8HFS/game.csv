"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm confident that this price reflects the significant return on investment you'll see.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's value,  $1,600,000 is too high for my budget.  I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $800,000. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $800,000 is too low, I'm open to finding a middle ground. Would you be willing to consider $1,350,000?  This price reflects a more reasonable compromise while still acknowledging the true value of this product.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,350,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000.  I believe this represents a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my valuation. To be candid, I need to get at least $1,200,000 for this product. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?  It's my final offer, as I already have another interested buyer at that amount.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
