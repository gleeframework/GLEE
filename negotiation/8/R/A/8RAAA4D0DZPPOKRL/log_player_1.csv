"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a price that reflects the value of the product to me while also leaving room for negotiation. This initial offer will gauge Bob's interest and give me a starting point for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price. While $900,000 is better than John's offer, I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm raising the price slightly, aiming to meet Bob halfway. This counteroffer shows I'm willing to negotiate while also maintaining a price that's closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to push for a higher price, Bob's offer of $920,000 is closer to my desired value than John's offer of $800,000.  Considering we're only halfway through the negotiation rounds, accepting this offer ensures a solid profit and minimizes the risk of losing the deal."
