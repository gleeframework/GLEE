"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob. It's a good starting point to gauge his interest and leaves room for negotiation.  I'm also emphasizing the fairness of the price to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can still get the same price from John.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Bob to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $1,200,000 doesn't reflect the full value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,275,000. This gives us both a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1275000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum price of $1,200,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to go below my minimum price.  It's worth continuing to negotiate with Bob to see if I can get a higher price.  I'm also mindful of the possibility of selling to John for $1,200,000, but I'd like to see if I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  However, $1,250,000 is still a bit lower than I can accept. I'm willing to come down to $1,260,000 as a final offer.  This represents a significant compromise on my part.  Let me know if you're interested in finalizing the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1260000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,240,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,240,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,240,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum price, and we've gone through several rounds of negotiation.  While it's tempting to continue, the risk of reaching a stalemate is high, and I'm running out of rounds.  John is offering my minimum price, so it's the best option at this point."
