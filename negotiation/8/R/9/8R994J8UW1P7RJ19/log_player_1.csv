Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  If Bob rejects, I'll be ready to counter, but I want to see if he's serious about this purchase."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept. I want to see if I can get more.  I'll counter with a price slightly higher than his offer, but still lower than my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to try and meet Bob halfway.  $1,750,000 is a decent compromise, and hopefully, he'll see it as a fair price.  If he still wants to go lower, I might consider selling to John instead."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price.  It's worth it to me to secure the deal with Bob rather than risk further negotiation or selling to John for a lower price."
