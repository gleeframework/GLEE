"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I know you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $9,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is under your $10,000 maximum, you can likely get a better price. By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're willing to walk away. She might come back with a lower price to avoid losing the sale. If not, you can always buy from John for $10,000."
