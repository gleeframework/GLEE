Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer allows me to potentially earn a good profit, while still leaving room for negotiation if Bob wants to haggle.  It also sets a high starting point, making it more likely that I'll be able to negotiate a higher price if Bob counters."
