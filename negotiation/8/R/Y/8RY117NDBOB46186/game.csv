"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As the owner, I'm willing to part with it for a price of $1,200,000. This is a fantastic deal, considering the product's true value is $1,500,000 to you. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm very interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,150,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's true value, but also acknowledges your willingness to make a serious offer. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $1,150,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a touch high. Could we settle at $1,050,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to make a deal.
