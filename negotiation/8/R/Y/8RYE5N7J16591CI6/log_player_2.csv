# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal for you, as you've mentioned the value is $1,500,000 for your purposes.  Let me know if you're interested, otherwise I'll be moving forward with another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than your maximum budget, you know John is willing to sell it for $1,500,000. There's a chance you can get Alice to come down further in price, saving you even more money."
