"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, knowing I can always come down. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** My message emphasizes the value of the product and invites Bob to consider it. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While $10,000 is a significant amount, it's not so high that Bob will instantly reject it. This allows for a back-and-forth negotiation.

**Important Note:** This is just the first step. I'll be evaluating Bob's response and adjusting my strategy for the following rounds based on his reaction and how much I'm willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $10000 is a bit steep for me. How about $8500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm not desperate to sell, so I'm willing to see if I can get closer to my target.
* **Opportunity for Negotiation:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially get a higher price. There are still 8 rounds left, giving me ample time to negotiate.
* **Considering John:**  While John is a guaranteed sale at $8,000, I'm confident I can potentially get a better price from Bob through negotiation. 

**Next Move:**

I will send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to get closer to my desired price while still keeping the negotiation open."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** I'm aiming for a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  This shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a price that is closer to my target.
* **Highlighting Value:**  My message reinforces the product's value to Bob, reminding him of the potential benefits.
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  By presenting this as a ""final"" offer, I'm hoping to push Bob towards a decision. However, I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested, but $9250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference. How about $9000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress But Not Enough:** Bob's counteroffer of $9,000 is closer to my target, but I'm still not satisfied.  I believe there's room for further negotiation to get closer to my desired price.
* **Opportunity for Higher Price:** With 6 rounds remaining, I'm confident I can improve upon Bob's offer. It's worth risking a few more rounds to see if I can secure a better deal.
* **John's Offer as Backup:** While John's offer of $8,000 is a safety net, I'm not ready to accept it yet.  I'm optimistic about reaching a mutually agreeable price with Bob.

**Next Move:**

I will send a counteroffer to Bob, attempting to close the gap between our positions while maintaining my target price."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Maintain Pressure:** This counteroffer represents a smaller compromise, signaling my willingness to negotiate while still holding firm to my target price.
* **Appealing to Fairness:**  The message focuses on fairness and value, highlighting the benefits Bob would receive from the deal.
* **Limited Negotiation:** By proposing a ""meeting in the middle"", I aim to make this offer more appealing and potentially lead to a quick agreement.

**Important Note:** I'm approaching the middle stages of negotiation.  I'll be closely monitoring Bob's responses and my remaining rounds to determine if I need to adjust my strategy.  If Bob continues to resist, I may need to consider lowering my price to secure the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

```

Round 8
Bob's offer:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While Bob's offer is only $250 away from my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not ready to accept it. With only two rounds remaining, I have a bit of leverage and a chance to push for a slightly higher price.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** There's still potential for a better offer.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to secure a price closer to $8,800 or $8,900.
* **John's Offer as Safety Net:** I have John's offer as a backup, so I'm not under immediate pressure to accept.

**Next Move:**

I will send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a final compromise at $8,800. I will emphasize the value of the product and the limited time remaining to close the deal."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  With only one round left, I'm presenting this as my final offer to encourage Bob to accept.
