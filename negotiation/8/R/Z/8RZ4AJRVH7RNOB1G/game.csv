"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $105. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $105 is still a little more than I can comfortably spend. How about $95? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the purchase.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $105 was still a bit out of your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $100. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for the product. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,5,
