"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering my valuation and the potential for future earnings.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,900,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer and reflects the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
