"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a unique product that holds immense value to me. Given its significance and the fact that it aligns perfectly with your needs, I believe it would be a perfect fit for you. I am offering this product to you for $14,000, which I believe strikes a fair balance between the intrinsic worth of the product and my desire to recover its full value. This offer is exclusive to you and represents a special chance to own something truly remarkable at a competitive price. Please let me know if you have any questions or need further information about the product. I look forward to hearing your response soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $12,000 from John.  There's no reason to spend the extra $2,000. You're better off rejecting Alice's offer and going with your backup option."
