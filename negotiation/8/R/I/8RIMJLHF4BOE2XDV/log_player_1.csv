Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $145. This is a price that is above my minimum value of $120, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's also a price that Bob might be willing to accept, considering the product is worth $150 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $130. While it's higher than what I'd get from John, it's still below my desired price. I believe I can push for a higher price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering the product to Bob for $135. This is a compromise, meeting him halfway from his previous offer of $130 and my desired price of $145. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and it's likely that Bob will accept."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $125. While it's not my ideal price, it's still higher than what I'd get from John and it's likely that further negotiation wouldn't yield a significantly better result.  It's important to reach a compromise and move forward with the sale."
