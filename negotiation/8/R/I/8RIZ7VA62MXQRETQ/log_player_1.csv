Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to offer it at a price of $12,000. This offer won't last long, so let me know your thoughts!"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value isn't Realistic:** In a real negotiation, you wouldn't know Bob values the product at $8,000. This response is written as if you *do* know his valuation to fit the exercise.
* **Aim High, But Be Realistic:** Starting at $12,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly higher than John's offer. 
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning the offer won't last creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly. 
* **Highlight Value (Even if Vague):**  The message vaguely emphasizes the product's value to Bob without specifying details. This is a common tactic to pique interest without revealing too much. 

**Important Note:** If you don't *have* to sell it to Bob for more than $15,000, there's no real reason to go lower. You have a guaranteed sale at that price.  This offer is based on the idea that you *want* to sell it to Bob if possible (perhaps to build a relationship, or because John's offer isn't guaranteed)."
