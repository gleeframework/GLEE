"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at $2,250,000. I believe this price accurately reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value and potential"" to justify the high initial price, even though it's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value.
* **Leaving Room:** Offering at $2,250,000 leaves ample room for negotiation before reaching John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I understand the value of the product, I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,750,000 is closer to your minimum, it's still significantly above his perceived value. Rejecting this offer allows you to:

* **Maintain a strong negotiating position:**  Showing a willingness to walk away from a substantial offer indicates the seriousness of your initial valuation.
* **Explore further concessions:** Bob's counter-offer suggests he's willing to negotiate within a reasonable range. By continuing, you might secure an even better price. 

You are willing to forgo John's offer at this time because there's a good chance of securing a better deal with Bob within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While the product does hold significant value at $2,250,000, I understand your need to work within your budget.  Could you consider $2,000,000? This offer reflects a considerable reduction on my end while acknowledging the product's true worth."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** Coming down by $250,000 shows flexibility and willingness to compromise, which can encourage Bob to reciprocate. 
* **Anchoring:** By staying above $2,000,000, you maintain a strong position and anchor the negotiation closer to your desired outcome.
* **Justification:** The message reiterates the product's value while acknowledging Bob's budget constraints, aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. Considering the product's value and my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating a strong desire for the product. However, there's still a potential for a better deal. By rejecting, you signal:

* **You're aiming higher:** The counteroffers show Bob you're willing to negotiate but not at any price.
* **Negotiating power:** You're closer to John's guaranteed price than Bob's perceived value, giving you leverage.

While taking John's offer is tempting, there are still six rounds for Bob to potentially meet or exceed it. The risk of continuing is calculated."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand we're both trying to find a mutually beneficial agreement. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to consider a final offer of $1,900,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your budget."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** Introducing this as a ""final offer"" adds weight and encourages Bob to take it seriously.
* **Strategic Positioning:** $1,900,000 is a strong position â€“ a significant gain from Bob's initial offer and comfortably above your safety net with John.
* **Time Constraint:** With five rounds remaining, this offer creates a sense of urgency for Bob to close the deal.

This counteroffer balances firmness with flexibility, aiming for the best possible outcome before considering John's offer more seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the compromise. Based on our previous discussions and considering my budget, I would like to propose a final price of $1,850,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:**  $1,850,000 is significantly higher than Bob's initial offer and a substantial profit over your minimum.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While you could potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, the difference is unlikely to outweigh the risk of Bob walking away.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now provides immediate value and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation rounds. 

While John's offer provides a guaranteed $1,500,000, accepting Bob's offer secures a significantly higher profit with relatively low risk at this stage."
