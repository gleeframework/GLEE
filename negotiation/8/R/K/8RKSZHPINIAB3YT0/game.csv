"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,100,000 for the product. How about we compromise at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $1,025,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
