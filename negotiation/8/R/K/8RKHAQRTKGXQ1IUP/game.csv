"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you reaching out. While I'm definitely interested in the product, $250 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $150 for it. What do you think?",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $250 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $200 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value and uniqueness. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $200 is still too much for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $175.  It's a fair compromise and would let us both get a good deal.  What do you say?",175.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $185. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",185.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate you coming down on the price.  $185 is closer to where I'm at, but I can only go up to $170. It's still a fair deal for both of us, as it's right in between our last offers. What do you think?",170.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I can see we're getting close to a deal! I'm willing to meet you at $180, which is right in the middle of our last two offers. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you getting closer. $180 is really tempting, but I'm still a little over my budget.  My final offer is $165. This is the absolute highest I can go, and I'm confident you'll still make a good profit.  Let's close this deal!",165.0,Bob,8,

"Hi Bob, I can see you're really trying to make this deal work, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you at $175, which is the same price I offered earlier. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to compromise. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,9,
