(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob can get a better deal than $9,500. While it's less than John's price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt a counteroffer and potentially save more money."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's desired price point, but lower than John's price. This makes it worth continuing to negotiate. There's a chance Alice might be willing to come down a bit more, and Bob could potentially save more money."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum price, but it's still above his desired price point. At this point, the negotiation is taking time and might not yield a better price. It's more efficient for Bob to purchase the product from John for $12,000, as he's guaranteed to get the product and the price difference is not significant enough to justify further negotiation."
