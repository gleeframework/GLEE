"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  It's above your target of $15,000, and you have room to negotiate.
* **You have 10 rounds.**  This gives you time to try and get a better price.
* **Buying from John is a backup option.**  You can always go to John if you can't reach a deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start low:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, showing your willingness to negotiate.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  It's still above Alice's minimum selling price of $8,000, so there's potential for a compromise.
* **First round:**  This is the first counteroffer, so it's important to start with a substantial change to signal your serious intent to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your target:**  While it's lower than her first offer, it's still higher than your desired price point. 
* **You have room to negotiate further:** You have 7 more rounds, and there's potential for Alice to come down further to meet your needs.
* **Buying from John is still a fallback:** You can always choose to buy from John if you can't reach a deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increase your offer slightly:**  This shows you're willing to compromise but still pushing for a better price.
* **Meet Alice halfway:** You're essentially splitting the difference between your last offer ($9,000) and Alice's current offer ($10,000).
* **Maintain pressure:**  This keeps the negotiation moving forward, and gives Alice another chance to consider a deal."
