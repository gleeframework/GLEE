"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product at $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a better price. I'm confident that I can negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $10,000, hoping to find a middle ground with Bob. I'm still aiming for a price closer to my desired value of $12,000, but I'm also acknowledging that Bob is unlikely to pay the full $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,500 is very close to my desired price.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $10,000, I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for $8,000.  Accepting this offer ensures I make a decent profit and avoid any further negotiation."
