Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,300,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, I believe the product's value warrants a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,375,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes its true worth."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1,375,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,325,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price that reflects the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

At this point, accepting Bob's offer of $1,325,000 is the most strategically sound decision. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** This price still nets a $125,000 profit over your minimum acceptable price.
* **Strong Negotiation:** Bob has consistently shown willingness to negotiate, indicating a serious interest in the product.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Further haggling risks alienating Bob. While John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, accepting Bob's offer yields a higher profit. 

It's always a balance between maximizing profit and securing the deal. In this case, accepting the $1,325,000 strikes a good balance."
