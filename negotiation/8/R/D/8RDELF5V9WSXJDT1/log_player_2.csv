You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  The product is worth $120 to her, so there's room for a deal that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $140 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $130.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $135? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135

Alice's offer of $135 is a good compromise, and it's still below my maximum of $150.  Let's close this deal!"
