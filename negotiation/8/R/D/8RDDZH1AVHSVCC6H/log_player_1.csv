Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly valued by many satisfied customers.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $120 is still a bit high for me. I'm only willing to pay $80 at this point. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
