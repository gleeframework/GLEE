"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a valuable product that I believe would greatly benefit you. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is far beyond what I'm able to spend. I'm very interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $800,000.  Let's start there. I'm ready to negotiate further if you're open to it.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but my initial price reflects the true value of this product.  Let's find a middle ground. How about we consider $1,400,000? I'm confident this investment will yield significant returns for you.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still out of my reach. I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, taking anything under $1,200,000 would be selling myself short on this product's value. That being said, I want to make a deal with you.  Can you meet me at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This is a substantial amount for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise given our previous offers.  Let's find a way to make this deal happen.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
