"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $150 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $150, which is higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. My message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to build a rapport with Bob.  I'll see how he responds and adjust my strategy from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is significantly lower than my minimum. While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to sell for less than $120. I'll counteroffer and try to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $130? I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 
 
I'm going to counter with $130, which is still above my minimum but shows some willingness to compromise. I'm highlighting the value of the product and hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with.  I want to see if we can find a compromise at $120, but I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for that price. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob for one more round to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $110 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $120, which is my absolute minimum.  This is a fair price for the value this product brings. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm offering my absolute minimum price of $120, emphasizing its fairness and hoping to close the deal. I'm also reminding Bob of the value he'll receive from the product.  This is my final offer, and I'm prepared to sell to John if Bob rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $120 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $115 is still below my minimum, and we're already in round 6. I've made it clear that $120 is my bottom line, and I'm not willing to budge further. It's time to cut my losses and move on to John, who is guaranteed to buy at my minimum price."
