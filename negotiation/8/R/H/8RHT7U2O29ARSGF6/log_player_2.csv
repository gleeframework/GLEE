"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of my product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic product at a competitive price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

You should reject Alice's offer.  You can get the product for less from John, so it makes sense to try and negotiate a better price with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You can get the product for less from John, and you're still willing to pay more than John to get a slightly better deal. It's worth negotiating further with Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $9,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You should choose to buy from John. Although Alice is getting closer to your desired price, she's still not willing to go as low as $9,000, which is where you feel comfortable. Since John is willing to sell the product for $8,000, it makes more sense to go with him and avoid any further negotiation with Alice."
