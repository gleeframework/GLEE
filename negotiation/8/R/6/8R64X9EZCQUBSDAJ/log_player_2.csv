"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair starting point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $900,000 is still too high. You're aiming for a price closer to $800,000.
* You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so there's room to push for a better deal.  
* Buying from John immediately would cost you $1,200,000, which is significantly more than you're willing to pay."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $875,000 is still a bit high for me.
