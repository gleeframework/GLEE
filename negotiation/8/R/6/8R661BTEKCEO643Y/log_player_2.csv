"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an exclusive opportunity to acquire our premium product. Given its exceptional value and quality, we believe it would be a perfect fit for your needs. We are offering this remarkable item at a special introductory price of $950,000. This is a unique chance to secure such a valuable asset at a discount. We look forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a great deal! You're getting the product for $50,000 less than your maximum budget and well below Alice's perceived value. There's no guarantee you'd be able to negotiate a better price, and you risk losing the opportunity altogether."
