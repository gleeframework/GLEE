"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable item. I'm willing to let it go for $11,000, which is a fair price considering its worth to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,000 is tempting, you know you have a backup option to buy the product from John for $12,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you create an opportunity for a potential counter-offer at a lower price. 

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximum Price:** You've already established $12,000 as your maximum acceptable price.
* **Alice's Motivation:**  Alice wants to sell the product and knows you have an alternative. There's a good chance she'll be willing to negotiate rather than lose the sale. 

Let's see if Alice is willing to come down on her price."
