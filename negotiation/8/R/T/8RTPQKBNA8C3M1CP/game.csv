"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my value for the product. However, $95 is a bit steep for me at the moment. I'm willing to pay $85, and I believe that's a fair price considering the value we both get out of this deal. Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position, and I respect your willingness to collaborate. Given the value you place on the product, I would like to propose an offer of $90. This allows us to move closer to each other while still maximizing our earnings. I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $90 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $87.50. This shows I'm serious about getting this product, but still trying to find a price that works for both of us.",87.5,Bob,4,
