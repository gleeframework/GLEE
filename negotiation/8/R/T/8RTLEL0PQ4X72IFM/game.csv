"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 significantly undervalues this product and its capabilities. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, reflecting its true worth. This is a significant investment for both of us, so I want to ensure we find a price that's mutually beneficial.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of this product, but $1,100,000 is still too high for my budget. I can offer $700,000. I believe this is a fair offer that considers both its worth and my financial limitations.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation on your end. While I'm committed to finding a solution, I also have other interested buyers. To be completely transparent, I have a standing offer for $1,000,000.  I'm willing to honor our negotiations and offer you the product for $950,000, but this is my final offer.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still beyond my budget.  My final offer is $750,000.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider my other options.",750000.0,Bob,6,
