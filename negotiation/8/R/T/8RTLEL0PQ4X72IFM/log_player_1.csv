"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This allows room for negotiation and creates the perception that the product is highly valued.
* **Leaving Room for John:** While I want to maximize profit, I also want to avoid endless negotiation. By starting high, I have space to come down significantly while still exceeding John's offer. 
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This first offer is as much about gathering information as it is about making a sale. Bob's reaction will give me insight into his level of interest and potential for a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum and his own stated value. While I expected negotiation, this indicates he's aiming for a much lower price point than I'm willing to accept. I'll counter-offer, but I'm keeping John in mind as a strong alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 significantly undervalues this product and its capabilities. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, reflecting its true worth. This is a significant investment for both of us, so I want to ensure we find a price that's mutually beneficial."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Reduction:** I've decreased my asking price by $200,000, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still well above both my minimum and Bob's offer, maintaining a strong position.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the price and prevent Bob from anchoring too low.
* **Seeking Mutually Beneficial Outcome:**  Framing the negotiation as a win-win encourages Bob to engage constructively and move closer to a realistic price.

I'm getting closer to John's offer, but I believe there's still room for a deal with Bob that benefits us both. I'll reassess if he comes back with another low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of this product, but $1,100,000 is still too high for my budget. I can offer $700,000. I believe this is a fair offer that considers both its worth and my financial limitations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob increased his offer, but it's still significantly below my $1,000,000 minimum. While I want to be flexible, I'm not willing to go below my threshold, especially when I have John's guaranteed offer.  I'll counter-offer again, but this is getting close to the point where I'll take John's deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation on your end. While I'm committed to finding a solution, I also have other interested buyers. To be completely transparent, I have a standing offer for $1,000,000.  I'm willing to honor our negotiations and offer you the product for $950,000, but this is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Introducing Urgency:** I'm letting Bob know about John's offer without revealing the full amount. This creates a sense of competition and urgency for him to make a decision.
* **Final Offer:**  By stating this is my final offer, I'm signaling that I'm serious and won't go any lower. This also sets a clear expectation for the next round. 
* **Balancing Profit and Risk:**  $950,000 is a significant profit, and I'm willing to accept a slightly lower amount to avoid the risk of Bob walking away and potentially losing John's offer in further negotiations. 

This is a strong but fair offer, and I'm hoping it encourages Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still beyond my budget.  My final offer is $750,000.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider my other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is Anchored:** Bob's offer is still far below my minimum and he's only slightly increasing his bids each round. This suggests he's unlikely to drastically change his position.
* **Final Offer:** Bob stating his ""final offer"" limits my negotiating power moving forward.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John's offer guarantees me my desired profit without further risk or time spent negotiating.

It's time to cut my losses with Bob. While I could potentially squeeze out a bit more from him, the risk outweighs the potential reward at this point. John's guaranteed offer provides a clean and profitable exit."
