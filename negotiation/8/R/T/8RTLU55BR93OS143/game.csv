"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm aiming for a price closer to $500,000.  Would that be feasible?",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $750,000. This is a significant discount from the original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $700,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",700000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand this is your bottom line, but I'm afraid $650,000 is the absolute highest I can justify.  Perhaps we can agree on that?",650000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product for $675,000. This is as close to your offer as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",675000.0,Alice,7,
