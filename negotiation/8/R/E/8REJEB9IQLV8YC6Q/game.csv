"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $120 for the product.  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway.",120.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $110, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",110.0,Bob,4,
