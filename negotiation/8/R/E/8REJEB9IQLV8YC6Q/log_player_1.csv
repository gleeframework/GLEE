{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This is a reasonable starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of $80, but below your minimum of $150. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, while still allowing you to make a profit.  I'll need to adapt my offers based on Bob's responses to maximize my earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm not going to give in to his first counteroffer.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $120 for the product.  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $110, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $110 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I've already made two counteroffers, and Bob seems unwilling to budge much further.  At this point, it's clear that I can get a better price by selling to John.  I'll take the guaranteed $150 and move on."
