Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Potential Profit:** There's a potential $500,000 profit margin if you can sell to Bob for more than your minimum.

**The Strategy**

The key is to offer a price that's appealing to Bob while maximizing your profit.  Going too high risks him rejecting the offer.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone with your interests. I'm proposing a price of $1,250,000."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer is presented as an ""opportunity,"" subtly implying value.
* **Midpoint Price:** $1,250,000 is a strong starting point. It's a significant profit for you while still being considerably below Bob's maximum valuation.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While this is your initial offer, it leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, making him feel like he got a good deal.

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept $1,250,000. You know your product and Bob's potential interest best. Adjust the price within that range based on your assessment of his willingness to pay."
