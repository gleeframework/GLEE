"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This reflects a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
