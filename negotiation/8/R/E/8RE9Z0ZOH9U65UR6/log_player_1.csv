``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000 but still leaves room for negotiation with Bob, who values the product at $1,500,000.  I'm hoping to reach a price closer to $1,400,000, but I'm willing to negotiate depending on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth and what I initially offered. I want to see if I can get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This reflects a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This feels like a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal of $1,200,000,  $950,000 is a reasonable compromise. It's significantly higher than John's offer of $800,000 and a good price considering the time spent negotiating."
