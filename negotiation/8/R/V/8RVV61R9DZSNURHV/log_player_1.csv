"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110.  This is a good starting point because it's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident John will buy the product for $120 if I need to, but I'm hoping to get closer to my own valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $95 is too far below my minimum acceptable price of $120. While it's tempting to take the deal, I'm willing to risk losing Bob as a buyer for now. I'm going to try and get closer to my goal price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm countering with $105.  This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that we both can agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for that price. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm countering with $100. I'm hoping this final compromise will be enough to get Bob to agree.  If he rejects, I'll move on to John to secure the sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'm disappointed that I wasn't able to get closer to my ideal price with Bob, I've reached a point where I need to secure a sale.  Bob's latest offer is below my minimum, and I'm running out of rounds.  Selling to John for $120 guarantees me a profit and ensures I meet my minimum goal."
