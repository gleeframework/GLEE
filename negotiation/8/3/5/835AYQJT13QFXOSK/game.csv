"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $110 is too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $125. This is still a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $125 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle on $115? It's a fair price that's reasonable for both of us.",115.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you. I can do $120, which is my absolute minimum. This way we both get a fair deal. Let me know if you're interested.",120.0,Alice,5,
