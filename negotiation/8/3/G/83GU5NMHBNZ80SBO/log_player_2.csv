# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for only $145. Given its value to you, this seems like an excellent opportunity for both of us. Please let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $145 is within your budget, you can potentially get a better price. Rejecting Alice's offer opens the possibility of a counter-offer or sticking with your alternative option (John at $150)."
