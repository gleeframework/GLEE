"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $100, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Benefit highlighting:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product for Bob.
* **Open to negotiation:** My message implies flexibility and willingness to discuss.

**Strategy:**

This initial offer aims to gauge Bob's interest while setting a high baseline. I'll assess his response and adjust my strategy accordingly in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to keep my budget under $80. Would you consider lowering the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $75 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. Accepting this offer would be a significant loss for me.
* **Potential for negotiation:** While Bob is clearly trying to get the product for a low price, there's still room for negotiation.  I can try to bridge the gap by offering a counteroffer.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  I have the option to sell to John for $120, so there's no immediate pressure to accept a significantly lower offer.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation and try to reach a price that's more favorable to me. My goal is to either get Bob to increase his offer or to use John's offer as leverage to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're working with a budget. While I can't go as low as $75, I'm willing to come down to $90. This is still a fair price considering the value this product offers. Let's find a solution that works for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, but not by too much.  
* **Appeal to value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth and justifying the price.
* **Positive tone:** I'm keeping the conversation friendly and collaborative, aiming to encourage further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a step towards Bob's offer, but still maintains a healthy profit margin for me.  I'm aiming to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway or if he'll continue pushing for a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your flexibility. I appreciate your offer, but I am still looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible for you to lower the price to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. While closer, it's still not a good deal for me.
* **Potential for a better deal:** Bob is clearly interested in the product and showing flexibility. There's a chance I can get him to go higher with a counteroffer.
* **John's offer is a fallback:**  Having the option to sell to John for $120 provides me with a safety net, allowing me to be patient in negotiations.

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. I'll try to push for a price closer to my target while keeping in mind that John's offer is always an option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about $95? It's a fair compromise, and it allows us to both walk away happy. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This offer is a halfway point between my previous offer ($90) and Bob's offer ($85). It shows willingness to compromise while still maintaining a healthy profit margin for me.
* **Emphasizing fairness:** I'm using phrases like ""fair compromise"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and create a positive negotiation atmosphere.
* **Open to further discussion:**  The message leaves room for further negotiation if Bob is still hesitant.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is designed to test Bob's willingness to meet me closer to my desired price point. I'll assess his response and decide whether to continue negotiating or to move towards John's offer if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts in finding a compromise. Considering my budget constraints, could you possibly lower the price to $88? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $88 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While I'm getting closer, it's still not a good deal for me.
* **John's offer is a strong fallback:** Having the option to sell to John for $120 gives me the flexibility to be patient and potentially get a better offer from Bob.
* **Potential for a better deal:** Bob is clearly interested in the product and is willing to negotiate. There's still a chance I can push for a higher price.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. I'll try to get Bob closer to my target price. I have John's offer as a safety net, so I don't need to rush into a deal that doesn't meet my needs."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can't go lower than $91.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 91}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway again:** This offer is a halfway point between my previous offer ($95) and Bob's offer ($88). It shows continued flexibility while still maintaining a decent profit margin.
* **Emphasizing fairness:** I'm using phrases like ""fair price for both of us"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and encourage him to see the value in my offer.
* **Positioning for a final agreement:** This counteroffer is a potential final offer before I start considering John's offer.  

**Strategy:**

I'm trying to get Bob to agree to a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price while still being reasonable for him.  If he rejects this offer, I'll likely move towards John's offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I am still aiming to stay within my budget. Could we possibly agree on a price of $89? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $89
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While $89 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not ideal. 
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:** With only 2 rounds left, the risk of continuing negotiations and not reaching a satisfactory deal is high.
* **John's Offer is Secure:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and eliminates the risk of losing a potential deal entirely.

**Strategy:**

The time for negotiation is running out. While I'm not completely satisfied with Bob's offer, it's not worth risking the deal and potentially ending up with nothing. Selling to John ensures I get my minimum desired price and eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiation."
