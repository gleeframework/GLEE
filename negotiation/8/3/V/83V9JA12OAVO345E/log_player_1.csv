Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I believe the product has potential, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $750,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, $1,125,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could we possibly agree on $900,000? I believe that's a fair offer that reflects the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable offer, it's unlikely he'll reach $1,000,000 quickly. Accepting his current offer means losing out on a significant amount. John provides a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept."
