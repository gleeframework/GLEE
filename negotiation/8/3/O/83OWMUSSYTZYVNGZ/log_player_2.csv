"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $9,000, which is a great deal considering its worth to me.  Let me know if you're interested!  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer is tempting, you know you can get the product for $8,000 from John.  Rejecting this offer keeps the door open for a better counter-offer from Alice, or you can always go with your backup plan."
