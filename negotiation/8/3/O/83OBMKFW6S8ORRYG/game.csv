"Bob, I have a product that I think would be perfect for your needs. It's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair for both of us.  I'm offering it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.  Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
