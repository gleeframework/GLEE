"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business or personal life.

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $950000. Would you be willing to consider a lower offer? I am looking to stay within a range of $750000 to $800000.",775000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $775000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850000. This is a significant discount from the original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I still feel that $850000 is slightly above my budget. Could we perhaps aim for a price closer to $800000? I believe this would be a mutually beneficial arrangement for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $825000. I've already compromised significantly, and I believe this price is a fair middle ground. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
