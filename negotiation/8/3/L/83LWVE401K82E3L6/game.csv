"Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this incredible product. Considering its value and potential, I believe a price of $2,000,000 is more than fair. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you be willing to consider a price of $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm confident in the value this product brings, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,850,000 for a swift deal. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you think?",1850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice. However, $1,850,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Would you be willing to consider a price of $1,725,000?",1725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle at $1,787,500? I think that's a fair deal that considers both of our positions.",1787500.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your proposal, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to compromise again. How about we meet at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Bob,6,
