"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I know it would be incredibly valuable for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $13,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While $13,000 is better than $15,000,  you have 10 rounds to negotiate and your goal is to save as much money as possible. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** You can try to get a lower price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair counteroffer:**  I'm proposing a price that is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still above her likely minimum price ($8,000). 
* **Positive tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone to encourage Alice to continue negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still high:** While closer to my desired price, $11,500 is still above my ideal range. 
* **More room for negotiation:**  I have 7 rounds remaining, which provides ample opportunity to continue bargaining. 
* **Avoiding a rushed decision:** Accepting now might leave money on the table, and I'm confident I can get a better price with more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $11,500 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably pay. Would you be willing to go down to $11,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental decrease:** I'm proposing a smaller decrease in price this time, demonstrating that I'm moving towards a compromise.
* **Emphasizing fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a fair price for both of us, subtly implying that I'm not trying to lowball her.
* **Urgency:** I'm mentioning the possibility of a quick close to incentivize Alice to accept."
