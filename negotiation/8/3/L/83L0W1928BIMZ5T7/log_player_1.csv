Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible while staying above your minimum ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's particularly interested.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, you're still guaranteed to sell it to John for your minimum acceptable price.

**Important Note:** There's always a chance Bob might accept the $119, even though it's above his perceived value. People don't always make perfectly rational decisions, and factors like urgency or perceived scarcity can influence buying behavior."
