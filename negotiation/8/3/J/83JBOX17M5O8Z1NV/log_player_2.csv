Alice's offer:

I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,000,000. This is a fair price, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're able to have a productive conversation. However, I still think the product is worth more than $700,000. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, but I have to say that if we can't come to an agreement, I'll have to consider other options. This is my final offer for now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice.  While her price has come down, it's clear she's unlikely to go much lower than $900,000.  You can get the product for a guaranteed $800,000 from John, saving you $100,000."
