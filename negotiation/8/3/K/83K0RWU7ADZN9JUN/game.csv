"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $950,000? This would still give you a good deal and allow me to make a decent profit. What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,
