Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had in it, I'm proposing a price of $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $12,000 leaves room for potential negotiation with Bob while staying above your minimum. 
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value and demand, which might encourage Bob to consider the offer even if it's above his perceived value. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy.  You could start lower to ensure Bob's interest, or higher to aim for maximum profit, but with a greater risk of Bob rejecting the offer outright."
