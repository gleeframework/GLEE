"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair and reflects the significant return on investment you'll experience. I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  You can get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John."
