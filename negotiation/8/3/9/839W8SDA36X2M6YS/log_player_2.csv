"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $1,500,000. Alice is offering the product for $1,400,000.  This is a better price than John's offer, but you can do better by rejecting Alice's offer and seeing if she'll counter with a lower price."
