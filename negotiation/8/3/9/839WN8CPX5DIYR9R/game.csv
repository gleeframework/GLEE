,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given my budget and the value I place on the product, I'd be willing to offer $9,500. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $11,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to get it down a bit further. Based on our discussions, I'm confident that we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer $10,000 for the product. Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to get the price down further, but I'm still not willing to go below $11,000. I'm willing to make a small concession, though. I'll offer you the product for $10,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",10800.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  However, $10,800 is still a bit outside of my comfort zone.  I'm confident that we can find a middle ground.  I'm willing to offer $10,500 for the product.  This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",10500.0,Bob,6,
