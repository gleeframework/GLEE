"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the interest in selling me the product. However, my budget is limited and I am looking for a price that fits within $80. Could we possibly come to an agreement closer to that amount?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $80 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $120. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $120 is a step in the right direction, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $80. Would you be open to considering $95 for the product?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a price closer to $80, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $95, so I can offer you the product for $107.50. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll still get a great deal. What do you think?",107.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. Considering our previous discussions, I would like to propose a price of $100 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable compromise between our initial offers. I hope this meets your expectations.",100.0,Bob,6,
