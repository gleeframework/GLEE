"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's value to Bob ($1,200,000), and there's a chance to negotiate a better price. There's also the option of buying from John, which serves as a safety net and bargaining power.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's value and the potential benefits it holds for me, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. This price reflects a fair balance between our respective interests and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering $1,050,000 for the product. This price still reflects its value to me, but I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,050,000 is still below the product's worth to Bob ($1,200,000), but it represents a significant improvement from her initial offer. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price without risking further negotiations that might result in a higher price or a stalemate. Buying from John for $1,500,000 would be a much worse deal."
