Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe would be very valuable to you, for $100."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** You know Bob values the product at $120, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum price.
* **Finding a Balance:** Offering the product at $100 allows you to make a significant profit ($20) while still presenting Bob with an attractive deal (saving him $20).  
* **Avoiding Extremes:**  While you could aim higher, getting too greedy might make Bob reject the offer. This price point increases the likelihood of a successful sale."
