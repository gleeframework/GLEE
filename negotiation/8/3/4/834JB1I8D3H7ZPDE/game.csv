"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product.  Given its value and features, I believe a starting price of $22,000 is fair. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $22,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $10,000 for it.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $18,000 is still out of my range. Let's try $12,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while remaining within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're finding some common ground.  While $12,000 is still lower than I'd like, I'm willing to consider it if we can agree on $16,000.  This offer reflects the true value of the product.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you getting closer to my price. $16,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to offer $14,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.",14000.0,Bob,6,
