"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product.  Given its value and features, I believe a starting price of $22,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $22,000 is far above your budget of $8,000.  There's no point in accepting it. You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so it's worth trying to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $22,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $10,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating your serious intent to buy while still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Realistic:**  $10,000 is within your budget, but still leaves a profit for Alice if she accepts.
* **Open-Ended:** The message invites further discussion and avoids a hard ""take it or leave it"" stance, keeping the negotiation open."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial price, $18,000 is still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** You have several rounds left to negotiate, and there's still potential for Alice to come down further.
* **Avoiding a Hasty Decision:** Accepting her offer now would mean paying more than you're comfortable with, and you might miss out on a better deal in the future rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $18,000 is still out of my range. Let's try $12,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while remaining within my budget."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Steady Progress:**  The offer is a significant step down from the previous round, but still acknowledges Alice's need for profit.
* **Fair Compromise:** The offer is a more realistic compromise, positioning you as a serious buyer willing to negotiate.
* **Emphasize Mutual Benefit:** The message focuses on the shared benefit of a deal,  making it more likely Alice will consider the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're finding some common ground.  While $12,000 is still lower than I'd like, I'm willing to consider it if we can agree on $16,000.  This offer reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Out of Budget:** Alice's offer of $16,000 is still too high for you. While it's a compromise, it's not a significant enough reduction to make it worthwhile. 
* **Negotiation Continues:**  You have several rounds remaining, and the negotiation is progressing. There's potential for Alice to come down further.
* **Avoiding a Hasty Decision:** Accepting now would mean overpaying, and you might miss out on a better deal in future rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you getting closer to my price. $16,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to offer $14,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Steady Progress:** This offer is a smaller step down from Alice's previous offer, but it shows you are still willing to negotiate.
