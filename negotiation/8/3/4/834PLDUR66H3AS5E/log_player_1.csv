Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000.  This is a bold move, but it allows for some wiggle room in the negotiation.  I know the product is worth at least $800,000 to me, so I'm not willing to accept anything lower than that.  I'm hoping that Bob might be willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm also prepared to negotiate down if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a significant amount, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $950,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also acknowledging Bob's willingness to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial $950,000 asking price, $925,000 is still a good deal.  It's a significant amount of money, and it's more than I would get from selling to John. I don't want to risk losing this deal altogether by continuing to negotiate."
