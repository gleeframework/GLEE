"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000. This product is valuable to me, but I'm working with a tight budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go as low as $850,000. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to the value I'm looking for.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point. However, I'm still feeling a bit stretched at $900,000. Would you be willing to come down to $875,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing me to secure the product and you to receive a price closer to your valuation.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference and aim for $887,500.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get closer to our desired price points.",887500.0,Alice,5,
