"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. Since the product is worth $100 to him, there's room for negotiation, and I'm hoping to get as close to my minimum of $150 as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $120 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm offering a price closer to my minimum, but still higher than Bob's offer. I believe this is a fair compromise and shows a willingness to meet halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. Although it's only $10 above my minimum, it's a good deal considering I've already rejected a few offers and I'm nearing the halfway point of our negotiation.  It's better to secure the sale now than risk losing the deal entirely or having to negotiate further."
