"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I'm a bit flexible, but I really want to make this deal work. Can we meet in the middle at $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $9,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and it'll allow us to close this deal quickly.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $7,500? I'm confident we can make this deal work at this price",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $7,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but $8,500 is my absolute bottom line.  Let's make this deal happen at that price, I think it's a fair compromise.",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $7,250? I'm really trying to make this deal work, but I need to stay within my budget",7250.0,Bob,6,
