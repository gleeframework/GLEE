Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $18,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000), but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Enthusiasm:**  A friendly message helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm leaving room to come down in price if necessary, but I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum value ($15,000) as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do it for $8,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

* **Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating with Bob.** I can try to reach a compromise closer to my desired price.
* **Selling to John is still an option.** This would guarantee me my minimum value, but I want to exhaust negotiation with Bob first."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you showing interest in the product.  While $8,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $14,000.  This price still allows me to make a fair profit, but also demonstrates my commitment to making this work for us."", ""product_price"": 14000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $14,000 is still a bit outside my budget, but I'm getting closer. Would you be willing to meet in the middle somewhere around $11,000?
