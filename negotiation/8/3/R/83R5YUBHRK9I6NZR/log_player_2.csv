"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product which I believe you'll find valuable.  I'm asking for $115. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay a maximum of $120, and Alice is asking for $115.  While this is a good price, you can get the product for the same amount from John.  It's always better to get the lowest price possible, so you should reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
