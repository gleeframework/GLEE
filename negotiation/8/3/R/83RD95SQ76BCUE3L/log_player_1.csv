{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to you, I'm sure you'll agree. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $12,000 is significantly higher than your minimum of $8,000. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob is willing to pay $15,000, so there is room for both of you to find a price you are happy with. 
* **It's not too aggressive:**  A lower offer might make Bob hesitant to negotiate further. 

Let me know if you want to adjust the offer based on Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $9,000 is still significantly lower than what I'm hoping to get. I'm going to try and get closer to my initial offer with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? I'm confident you'll find the product worth that price, and it's still a good deal for you."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Moves closer to your desired price:** It's a compromise from your initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer.
* **Shows flexibility:** You're willing to negotiate, which might make Bob more likely to meet you in the middle.
* **Highlights the value:** You remind Bob of the product's worth, making him consider if it's worth the extra $1,500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we try $10,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $10,250.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial $12,000, this is still a good deal for me.  It's significantly higher than selling to John, and it's close enough to my desired price that it's worth closing the deal."
