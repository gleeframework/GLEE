Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1150000} 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. I believe this price reflects the product's worth to me while also being attractive enough for Bob to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm willing to take the risk of continuing the negotiation.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's lower than my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's current offer. It shows my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price point that is closer to my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd like to get closer to my desired price, Bob's offer is becoming increasingly unattractive. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk further negotiations with Bob."
