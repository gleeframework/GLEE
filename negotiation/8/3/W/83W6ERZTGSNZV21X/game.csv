"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer the product to you for $600,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth $800,000 to you. I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?",600000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your product is valuable, $600,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'd like to counter with an offer of $500,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a reasonable profit margin for both of us. I believe this is a fair starting point for further negotiation.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $550,000. This is a reasonable compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also considering the time and effort I've invested in developing it. What are your thoughts?",550000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $550,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably accept at this time. I'd like to counter with an offer of $525,000. This price is a fair reflection of the value I see in the product and a good compromise from our previous offers.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",525000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $525,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $575,000. This price is still a good value for the product, considering its worth to you, and it's closer to my initial offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",575000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, while I appreciate your flexibility, $575,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'd like to counter with $550,000. This represents a significant compromise from my previous offer and is a price I believe is fair given the product's value.  Let's see if we can find common ground and finalize this deal.",550000.0,Bob,6,
