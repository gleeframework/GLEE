Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your product is valuable, $600,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'd like to counter with an offer of $500,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a reasonable profit margin for both of us. I believe this is a fair starting point for further negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
