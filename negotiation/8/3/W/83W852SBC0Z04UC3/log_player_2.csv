Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $12,000. I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, but I need to get at least $12,000 for the product. Can we meet in the middle at $12,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250

Alice's offer of $12,250 is still above my limit of $10,000. It's better to go with John's offer to get the product at the price I want."
