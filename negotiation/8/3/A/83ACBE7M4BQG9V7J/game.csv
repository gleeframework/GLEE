"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. After reevaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $975,000. This is a fair compromise considering its worth to you is $1,000,000.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $975,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle at $900,000?  I believe that's a fair offer considering the current market value.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $925,000. This is my final compromise.",925000.0,Alice,5,
