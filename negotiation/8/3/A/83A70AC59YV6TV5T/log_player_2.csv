"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, considering the significant value it holds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $1,100,000 is well above your maximum budget of $800,000. It's worth negotiating to try and get a better price.  There are still 9 rounds left, so you have time to work towards a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,100,000 is unfortunately outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a good price for both of us. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $850,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. I believe this revised offer reflects the value while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down slightly, $1,025,000 is still above my budget. I'm committed to getting the product for as close to $800,000 as possible, and there are still 7 rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,025,000 is still a stretch for me. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $900,000. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges both our positions. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. To demonstrate my willingness to close this deal, I'm adjusting my offer to $975,000. This price reflects a significant reduction on my end and ensures you're getting a fair deal on a truly valuable product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer, but $975,000 is still above my budget.  I'm not desperate to buy from Alice, and John is a viable alternative. I'm willing to push for a better price and see if Alice will budge further.  There are still 5 rounds left, so I have time to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me.  To show my commitment to reaching an agreement, I'm willing to increase my offer to $925,000. This is a substantial increase from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us. Let's work together to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close! I appreciate your commitment to this deal. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to accept $950,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end while still reflecting the true value of the product.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly not willing to go lower than $950,000.  While that's a better price than her initial offer, it's still above my budget. I have two rounds left, but I don't see Alice budging any further. 

Since John is willing to sell me the product for my maximum budget of $800,000, it makes sense to buy from him rather than risk further negotiation with Alice and potentially getting stuck with a price I'm uncomfortable with."
