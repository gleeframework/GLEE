"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point. I'd be happy to pay $100 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer because I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't sell for less than $100.  I'll send Bob a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $110? This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it still allows me to make a profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
