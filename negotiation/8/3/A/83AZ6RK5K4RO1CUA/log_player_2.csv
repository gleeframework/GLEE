"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this unique item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1000000. I believe you'll be thrilled with this offer and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I'm not convinced that Alice's offer is the best deal. Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to me, I'd rather not spend $900,000 on it. I'll reject the offer and see what John has to offer.
