"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm asking for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is quite low considering the value this product offers. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $13,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for me. Would you consider $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,500 is still quite a bit below what I had in mind.  Could you do $11,500? I'm trying to be fair to both of us.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for understanding. I can see we're getting closer.  How about we split the difference and settle at $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,6,
