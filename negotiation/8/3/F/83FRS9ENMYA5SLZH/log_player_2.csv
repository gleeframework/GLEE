"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously designed to meet your needs. This product holds immense value to us, but we believe it's also a perfect match for you. We're offering it at a special introductory price of $950,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of your product, $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer, but there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can potentially get a lower price by continuing to counteroffer.  Rejecting allows Bob to explore more favorable terms."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $850,000 is closer to my target, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial counteroffer.  How about $825,000?  I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your proposal, Bob. I appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement. In light of our previous discussions, I am prepared to offer the product at $840,000. This is my best offer, considering the value of the product and our ongoing negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $840,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $840,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer, and this offer is only $15,000 higher than Bob's last counteroffer.  At this point, it's probably in Bob's best interest to accept the offer.  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether, especially since the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob.  Accepting the offer saves Bob a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
