"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. I believe it holds immense value for someone like you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I see in it.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price. It shows you recognize the value of this product.  However, to be frank, $950,000 is still significantly less than what I believe it's worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This would allow both of us to walk away feeling like we got a fair deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to compromise further and offer $975,000 for the product. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the value I see in it.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but your latest offer doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to make one final offer at $1,025,000.  This is a firm offer. If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options, including selling to another interested buyer.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're firm on the price, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,025,000. I'm willing to go up to $990,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope you can meet me in the middle and find a mutually beneficial agreement.",990000.0,Bob,6,
