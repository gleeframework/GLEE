"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. I believe it holds immense value for someone like you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I'm open to hearing your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While knowing Bob values the product at $800,000, I want to anchor the negotiation high.  My first offer significantly exceeds his valuation, leaving room for negotiation while aiming for a price closer to my own valuation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $1,100,000 offer signals a willingness to negotiate. It gives Bob a chance to counter-offer without feeling insulted, which is crucial for a successful negotiation. 
* **Alternative Option:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer for $1,200,000 gives me leverage. I'm not desperate to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I see in it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is a significant increase from his initial valuation, it's still considerably lower than both my asking price and John's guaranteed offer.  I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to counter-offer to try and reach a price closer to my desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price. It shows you recognize the value of this product.  However, to be frank, $950,000 is still significantly less than what I believe it's worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This would allow both of us to walk away feeling like we got a fair deal."", 
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Progress:** I want to acknowledge Bob's willingness to negotiate by meeting him halfway between our previous offers.  This keeps the negotiation positive and collaborative.
* **Holding Firm:**  While I'm willing to compromise, I'm not going to drastically drop my price. My counter-offer of $1,050,000 maintains a strong position and reflects the product's value to me.
* **Time Constraint:** I'm aware of the 10-round limit. While I have John as a backup, I prefer to close the deal with Bob if possible, but not at the cost of a substantial loss."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to compromise further and offer $975,000 for the product. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the value I see in it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is inching closer, but his offer of $975,000 is still a significant difference from my target. I'm willing to play hardball a bit longer because I have the security of John's offer. It's time to send a strong signal that I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but your latest offer doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to make one final offer at $1,025,000.  This is a firm offer. If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options, including selling to another interested buyer."", 
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm making it clear that this is my final offer, adding a sense of urgency and seriousness to the negotiation.
* **Slight Concession:** I'm making a small concession to show flexibility, but I'm not significantly budging from my previous position.
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob of my alternative buyer (John). This reinforces the fact that I'm not desperate and willing to walk away if necessary.
* **Time Factor:** We're halfway through the rounds. Putting forth a final offer now puts the pressure on Bob to make a decision and hopefully close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're firm on the price, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,025,000. I'm willing to go up to $990,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope you can meet me in the middle and find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiations:** Bob's offer of $990,000 shows he's not willing to budge significantly. It's unlikely he'll suddenly jump to a figure closer to my $1,025,000, especially with five rounds remaining.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob has an opportunity cost. Each round spent on him is a round I'm not exploring other potential buyers or utilizing my time for other business opportunities.
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  John represents a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000.  While selling to Bob would be ideal, it's not worth potentially losing out on a guaranteed profit of $210,000 more.

**Conclusion:**

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Bob.  Securing the guaranteed sale with John is the most rational decision at this point."
