Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $100. I believe it would be highly valuable to you."", 
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:** Bob values the product at $120, so there's potential to sell it for more than your minimum acceptable price ($80).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $100 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, while still ensuring you make a good profit. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a backup buyer (John) at $80, so you're not desperate to sell to Bob at any cost. This gives you leverage.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your potential profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
