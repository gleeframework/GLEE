"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, which is valued at $1,500,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a discounted price.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800,000 is a bit lower than you're willing to go, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While I think the product is good, $1,100,000 is still a little too high for my budget.  How about we settle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000, but I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000. This is a compromise that should be acceptable to both of us, considering the value you place on the product.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
