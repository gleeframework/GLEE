"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,400,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to make Bob feel like it's a good deal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This offer leaves room for Bob to counter, which is essential for a good negotiation.
* **Knowing My Backup:** I'm aware that I have a guaranteed $1,500,000 offer from John, so I can afford to be somewhat firm in my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and far below my initial offer of $1,400,000. 
* **I have a better alternative:**  I can sell to John for $1,500,000, so I'm not under any pressure to accept Bob's low offer.
* **Room for negotiation:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. How about $1,250,000? That's still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer is a midpoint between my previous offer of $1,400,000 and Bob's offer of $1,000,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasize Value:** I reiterate the value of the product to Bob to justify my price.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a positive tone, avoiding accusatory language or negativity.
* **Keeping in Mind John's Offer:** I'm still aware of John's $1,500,000 offer, so I can be firm in my counteroffer but still leave room for negotiation."
