"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $120.  What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit out of my price range.  I'd be willing to pay $90 for it.  What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $110? That gives us both some room to be happy.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate you coming down on your price. $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $105?  That's a good compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with that price.",105.0,Bob,4,
