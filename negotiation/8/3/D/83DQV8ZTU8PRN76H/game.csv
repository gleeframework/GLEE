"Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you this fantastic product for $9,500.  It's a great deal for you and it allows me to get a good price for it. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. Would you be open to $8,500? That would give us both a good deal.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $9,000. This is still a fair price for both of us, and allows me to make a good profit. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $9,000 is closer, I'm still hoping for something a little lower. Would you consider $8,750? This would be a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to my budget.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $8,750 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,875? This would allow us to both get a good deal and move forward.  Let me know your thoughts.",8875.0,Alice,5,
