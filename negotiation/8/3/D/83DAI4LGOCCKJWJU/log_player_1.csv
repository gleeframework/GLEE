"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you do $650,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $650,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I won't accept such a low offer this early in the negotiation.  I believe I can get a higher price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $650,000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I have a firm budget.  Would you consider $725,000? It's a fair offer that brings us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $725,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm not yet willing to accept a deal that would cause such a substantial loss.  I'll continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of getting closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $725,000 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $850,000.  This price allows for a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $850,000 is very close, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you consider $775,000? That's a significant jump from my last offer and would allow us to close the deal today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $775,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not enough for me to accept. I'm determined to get closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. With six rounds remaining, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal and avoid selling to John for a lower price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $775,000 is still a significant gap for me.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000 as a final compromise.
