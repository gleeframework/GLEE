"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always best to try and negotiate for a better price. While $1,150,000 is within your budget, there's room for improvement.  You can start by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product,  $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for it.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value to both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price.  However, the value this product offers is truly significant, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,120,000. This reflects its true worth while acknowledging your interest.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price slightly, but it's still higher than you'd like to pay. You're still within your budget but can continue to negotiate.  It's worth seeing if you can get closer to your initial counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand the value you see in the product, but $1,120,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,085,000.  This would allow us both to make a deal that's fair.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1085000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me to find a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's make this happen - I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the product's significant value while being a fair deal for both of us.  Does this work for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,100,000, which is a better deal than buying from John for $1,200,000.  While you could try to negotiate further, it's risky.  Alice has indicated this is her ""final offer.""  If you reject it and try to counteroffer again, she may walk away. It's a good deal for you, so it's best to accept it."
