"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product,  $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for it.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value to both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price.  However, the value this product offers is truly significant, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,120,000. This reflects its true worth while acknowledging your interest.  What do you say?",1120000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value you see in the product, but $1,120,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,085,000.  This would allow us both to make a deal that's fair.  What do you think?",1085000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me to find a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's make this happen - I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the product's significant value while being a fair deal for both of us.  Does this work for you?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
