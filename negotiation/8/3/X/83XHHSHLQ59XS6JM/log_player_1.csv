"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its uniqueness and value, but my budget is limited. Would you consider accepting a counteroffer of $15000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. My minimum value for the product is $15,000, but I'd like to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit to $17,500 to see if we can reach an agreement. This reflects the value of the product and leaves room for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 17500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $16000. This still allows for a reasonable profit for you while staying within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. $16,000 is a good price, given that my minimum was $15,000 and I only have 6 rounds left.  It's better than selling to John for $15,000."
