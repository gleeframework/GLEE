"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value to each of us. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,175,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's work together to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
