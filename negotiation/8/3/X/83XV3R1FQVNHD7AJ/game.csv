"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1200000. I would like to propose a more reasonable price of $950000 to ensure we can both reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was really hoping to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1050000. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still a bit shy of my target price. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, but I can do better than that. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1075000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great value for the product.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"I think we're really close now, Bob! I'm glad we're able to find common ground. However, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1075000, but I'm willing to meet you at $1050000 this one last time. I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, like a free consultation and a warranty. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great value for the product.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
