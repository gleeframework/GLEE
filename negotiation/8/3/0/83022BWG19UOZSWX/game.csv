,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",105.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $95 is still a bit of a stretch for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $100, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",100.0,Alice,5,
