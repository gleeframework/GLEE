"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,800,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for starting the conversation.  While I agree the product has potential, that initial offer seems very high.  I'd be willing to start the conversation closer to $600,000."", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This offer reflects the  product's potential and allows us both to benefit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a big gap for me.  To be frank, I have a budget in mind closer to $700,000.  Would something around there be possible?"", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget, but the value of this product is substantial.  I'm willing to consider a significantly lower price, but $700,000 is too low. To meet you halfway, let's settle at $1,200,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly, but her ""final offer"" of $1,200,000 is still far higher than John's offer of $800,000.  

* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice knows the product is worth $1,200,000 to her. It's unlikely she'll go below this price.
* **Your Limit:** You've stated your budget is closer to $700,000. There's a massive $500,000 difference.
* **John's Offer:** John offers a sure thing at your target price.

Continuing the negotiation with Alice has a very low chance of success. It's time to cut your losses and secure the product from John at a price you're comfortable with."
