"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,800,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for starting the conversation.  While I agree the product has potential, that initial offer seems very high.  I'd be willing to start the conversation closer to $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This offer reflects the  product's potential and allows us both to benefit.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a big gap for me.  To be frank, I have a budget in mind closer to $700,000.  Would something around there be possible?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget, but the value of this product is substantial.  I'm willing to consider a significantly lower price, but $700,000 is too low. To meet you halfway, let's settle at $1,200,000. This is my final offer.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
