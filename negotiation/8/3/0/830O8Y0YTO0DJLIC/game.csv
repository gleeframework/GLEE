"I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm a bit hesitant to pay $2,300,000. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me is capped at $800,000.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is too low for me to consider.  This product has significant intrinsic value.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand the product has intrinsic value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a more substantial counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me is capped at $800,000.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
