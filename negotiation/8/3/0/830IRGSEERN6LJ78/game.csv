"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I was thinking of spending. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. Would that work for you?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm afraid $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $18,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value it holds for me.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. However, $18,000 is still a bit too steep for me. How about $13,000? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and reflects my strong interest in the product.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're still interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $13,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll offer it to you for $16,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your understanding. $16,000 is still a bit more than I hoped to spend. How about we settle at $14,000? That seems like a fair compromise to me.",14000.0,Bob,6,
