"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $170, hoping to get as close to my minimum acceptable price of $150 as possible.  I'm confident that Bob will counteroffer since the product is worth more to him than my initial asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $140 is closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to sell it for less than $150 yet. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm going to counter with $155. This is a slight concession from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $145 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hesitant to accept.  I'll make a counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm now offering my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but if not, I'm ready to sell to John for the same price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $142
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm running out of time and don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price. I'll sell to John for $150, which is a guaranteed profit."
