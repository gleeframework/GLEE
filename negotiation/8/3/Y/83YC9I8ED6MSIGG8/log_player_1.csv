{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $95. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum price of $80, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to pay closer to his value of $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $95 is a bit high for me.  How about $85?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $90 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to pay $87.  It's a fair price, and we can finalize this deal quickly. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $87 is close to my desired price and higher than what John is offering.  It's worth closing the deal and moving on."
