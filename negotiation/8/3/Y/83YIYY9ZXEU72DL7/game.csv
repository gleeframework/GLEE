"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still a bit higher than that.  How about $13,500?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal quickly.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,500 is still a bit more than I can do right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  That way we both get a good deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,
