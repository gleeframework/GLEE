"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $14,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's initial offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $12,000, given its value to me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, aiming to secure a more favorable price. He provides a justification for his offer, highlighting the value of the product to him, and aims to begin a negotiation that will ultimately reach a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is a significant drop from my initial price. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's initial counteroffer, Bob still has room to negotiate and potentially secure a lower price.  His goal is to save as much money as possible, and he can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  By rejecting the offer, he can explore further options and try to reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,500. This feels like a fair middle ground, considering our previous discussions. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to meet Alice halfway, but still aiming for a lower price.  He justifies his counteroffer by referencing their previous discussions and highlighting the importance of finding a fair middle ground.  By offering a slightly higher price than his previous counteroffer, he demonstrates his willingness to compromise while still trying to achieve his goal of saving money."
