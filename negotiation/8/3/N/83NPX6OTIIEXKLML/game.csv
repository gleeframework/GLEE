"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $12,000, given its value to me.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is a significant drop from my initial price. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This feels like a fair compromise to me.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,500. This feels like a fair middle ground, considering our previous discussions. What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,4,
