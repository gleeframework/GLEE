"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,300,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,300,000. I am willing to pay up to $950,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is within the range you consider reasonable for negotiations.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your budget constraints, the value of this product is significant and I can't drop the price that drastically.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000?  This reflects a substantial discount from my initial offer and ensures you're getting a fair deal on a product with immense potential.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I've reviewed your latest proposal carefully, and while I appreciate the effort, I still believe the product's value aligns more closely with a price closer to $900,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually agreeable price that respects both our positions. Here's my counteroffer at $900,000.",900000.0,Bob,4,
