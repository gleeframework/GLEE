"Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $150.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me in the middle at $135?",135.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I was really hoping to get a bit more for the product. How about we meet in the middle at $140? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll love the product.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $140. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $130? I think that's a fair price for the product.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going below $145. I'm willing to make one more concession, so how about we meet in the middle at $142.5? It's a great price for a product that I think you'll really love.",142.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $142.5 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $137.5? I think that's a fair price for the product.",137.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to reach an agreement, Bob. However, I'm still willing to make one more concession. How about we meet in the middle at $140.25? It's a great price for a product that I think you'll really love, and I'm willing to compromise to make a deal.",140.25,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $140.25. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I was thinking more along the lines of $138. How about we meet in the middle at $139? I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.",139.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $139. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet in the middle at $141? It's a great price for a product that I think you'll really love, and I'm willing to compromise to make a deal.",141.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $141. I'm willing to go up to $140, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet at this price. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John for $150.",140.0,Bob,10,
