Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,999. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Potential Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you should aim for a price slightly below that to incentivize Bob.
* **Negotiating Room:**  Starting high leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. You can always slightly lower the price if needed.
* **Psychological Pricing:** The $14,999 price point appears significantly more appealing than a flat $15,000.

While there's a chance Bob might accept a lower price, this strategy maximizes your potential earnings while still making the offer attractive to him."
