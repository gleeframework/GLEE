"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to own this truly unique product.  It's worth a significant sum to the right buyer. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000.  What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your product is interesting, but $1,600,000 is well above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm confident this product is worth significantly more than your valuation. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000,  which is a good compromise considering the value we both place on this product.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're getting closer.  Let's split the difference again - $1,200,000, and I think we have a deal.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too steep for me. Let's try $1,150,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
