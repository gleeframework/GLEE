""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to own this truly unique product.  It's worth a significant sum to the right buyer. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000.  What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is interesting, but $1,600,000 is well above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is the lowest possible amount he's willing to pay. It's too early to settle for this. We'll try to negotiate up from here."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm confident this product is worth significantly more than your valuation. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,300,000?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000,  which is a good compromise considering the value we both place on this product.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

We're making progress and Bob is moving in the right direction. While $1,100,000 is better, we're still in early rounds and can aim a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're getting closer.  Let's split the difference again - $1,200,000, and I think we have a deal."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too steep for me. Let's try $1,150,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is clearly committed to negotiating and we're getting close to the halfway point of the rounds. $1,150,000 is a solid profit and continuing to push risks a John sale.  It's time to accept."
