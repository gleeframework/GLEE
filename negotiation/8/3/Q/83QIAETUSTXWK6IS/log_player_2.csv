"Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Buying from Alice for $90** is better than buying from John for $100.  
* While you could try to negotiate with Alice further, the prompt doesn't provide the ability to do so.  
* The goal is to save money, and accepting Alice's offer achieves that."
