"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product,  $1,200,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. Would you be open to discussing that?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm glad you're willing to make a serious offer. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is the best I can do at this time.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, and I'm glad we're having a productive conversation. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, which is a compromise from my previous offer. I think this price reflects the value of the product and is a fair deal for both of us.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
