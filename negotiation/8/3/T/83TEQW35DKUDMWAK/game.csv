"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I see the value in the product, but $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is significantly below the product's true value.  Let's find a middle ground. How about we consider $1,075,000? This price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
