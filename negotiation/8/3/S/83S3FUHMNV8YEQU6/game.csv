"Hi Bob, I understand you're firm on your price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to meet you at $1500000. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your coming down in price, but $1500000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer you $1350000.  This would be a good deal for both of us.",1350000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1350000. I'm willing to meet you at $1475000. It's the highest I can go, and I think it's still a good compromise. What do you think?",1475000.0,Alice,7,
