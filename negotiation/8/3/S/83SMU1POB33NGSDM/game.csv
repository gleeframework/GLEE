"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and would be a fair compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a deal if you're willing to come down to this price.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,200,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,225,000?  This price would allow me to achieve my desired outcome while still giving you a great deal.",1225000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your proposal, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,225,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a price of $1,175,000. I think this is a fair compromise that would allow us to reach an agreement.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
