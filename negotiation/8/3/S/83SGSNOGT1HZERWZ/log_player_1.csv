{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can get more from John.  While $120 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum price of $150. I'll see if I can get closer to that by countering Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering $140 to Bob.  This is a compromise, meeting him halfway from my previous offer.  I'm hoping it's enough to entice him, but I'm still holding out for a higher price."

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not satisfied.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a deal.  If not, I'm prepared to sell to John."
