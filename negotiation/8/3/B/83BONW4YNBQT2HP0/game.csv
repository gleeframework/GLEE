"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a valuable asset that I believe will be extremely beneficial for you.  Let's start our negotiation with this price, and we can work from there.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is significantly lower than the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm confident this product will be worth much more to you in the long run.  How about we settle on $1,350,000? It's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. ",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,350,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,275,000. I think that's a more reasonable price considering the value I see in the product.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate you coming up on your offer, but $1,275,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,312,500? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both benefit from the deal.",1312500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still not comfortable with the price, Alice. I'm willing to come up a bit more, but I think $1,300,000 is my absolute maximum. I'd like to meet you at that price. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
