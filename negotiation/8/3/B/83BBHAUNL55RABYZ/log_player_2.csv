I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a substantial discount. This sets the tone for negotiation and shows Alice that I'm serious about getting a good deal. I believe $1,100,000 is a fair starting point, considering the product is worth $1,500,000 to Alice."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,250,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price that's right in the middle between my previous offer and Alice's current offer.

However, with only a few rounds left, I need to consider the possibility of purchasing from John if this offer is rejected."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only one round left, and Alice's offer still above my desired price point, the risk of further negotiation is too high.  I've reached a point where the potential savings from continuing to bargain with Alice are outweighed by the risk of not securing the product at all.  Purchasing from John at $1,500,000 guarantees I get the product within my budget.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a safer and more reliable option at this stage."
