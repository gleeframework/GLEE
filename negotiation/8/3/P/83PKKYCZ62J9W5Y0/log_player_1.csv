"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This is a good starting point because it allows for potential negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit.  If Bob rejects, I'll have to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,000. This is a compromise, but it's still higher than Bob's offer and closer to my desired price.  Hopefully, this will entice Bob to come closer to my asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than before, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm lowering my price to $8,500. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price and demonstrates my willingness to compromise.  I hope this will encourage Bob to make a counteroffer closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $7,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still going to reject it. I only have four rounds left, and I'm hoping to get a little closer to my desired price before selling to John.  I'm going to try to get Bob to agree on $8,000, but if he doesn't, I'll have to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $8,000, my absolute minimum. This is a risky move because I have only 3 rounds left to close the deal.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be forced to sell to John. I'm hoping that Bob will recognize this is my final offer and agree to buy the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $7,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I only have two rounds left. It's not worth risking further negotiations. It's time to take the sure thing and sell to John for $8,000."
