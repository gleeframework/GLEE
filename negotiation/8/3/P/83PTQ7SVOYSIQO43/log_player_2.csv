"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is better than Alice's original value of $12,000, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and potentially get closer to his target price of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $8,800. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,800 is closer to Bob's target price of $8,000, it's still more than he wants to pay. Bob has 7 rounds remaining and can potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and try to close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. I'm still hoping we can reach a deal that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $8,600 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8600}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,600. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell the product to you for $8,700. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has 5 rounds remaining, but the negotiation is getting closer to his target price.  While he would prefer to pay $8,000, Alice is firm at $8,700, and continuing to negotiate might risk her walking away. Accepting this offer saves Bob $300 compared to buying from John and ensures he gets the product."
