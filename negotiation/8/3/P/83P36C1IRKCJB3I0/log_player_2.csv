"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. My initial offer is $15,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far too high. You're willing to pay a maximum of $10,000, and her offer is $5,000 more than that. It's worthwhile to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for this product. It's a fair price, and it's the maximum I'm willing to spend. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so my counteroffer is $13,000. I think it's a fair price considering the value this product will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her first one, it's still above your maximum budget.  You're only willing to pay $10,000, so it's worth continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,000 is still outside my budget. I'm really serious about getting this product, but I can't go higher than $11,000. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is a compromise for you, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $13,000, so my counteroffer is $12,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value this product will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your budget. You've already made a counteroffer and she's rejected it. There's a risk that further negotiation will lead to more back and forth without a satisfying outcome. Since you have the option to buy from John at your desired price, it's better to secure the product now rather than risk further rounds of negotiation that might lead to a higher price or no deal at all."
