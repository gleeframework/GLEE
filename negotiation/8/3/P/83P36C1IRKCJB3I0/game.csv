"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. My initial offer is $15,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its worth to you.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for this product. It's a fair price, and it's the maximum I'm willing to spend. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so my counteroffer is $13,000. I think it's a fair price considering the value this product will bring to you.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,000 is still outside my budget. I'm really serious about getting this product, but I can't go higher than $11,000. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is a compromise for you, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $13,000, so my counteroffer is $12,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value this product will bring to you.",12000.0,Alice,5,
