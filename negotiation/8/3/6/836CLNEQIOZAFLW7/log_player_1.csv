Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer sets the price at $1,000,000. Here's why this is a good strategy:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're getting more than your minimum of $800,000. 
* **It's lower than Bob's value:** Bob is still getting a good deal since the product is worth $1,200,000 to him. This increases the likelihood he'll accept.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob is hesitant, you have some wiggle room to potentially lower the price a bit without going below your minimum."
