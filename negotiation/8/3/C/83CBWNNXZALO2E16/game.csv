"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate your product, $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This is a fair offer considering we're both looking to make a deal. Let's see if we can close this.",9000.0,Bob,4,
