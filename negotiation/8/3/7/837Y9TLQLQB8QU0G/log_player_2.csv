"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is better than $1,000,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $875,000, but I think that's as low as I can go. Let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** Alice has lowered her price to $875,000, which is closer to Bob's initial counteroffer of $850,000.
* **Bob's Goal:** Bob wants to save money, and $875,000 is a significant saving compared to John's price of $1,000,000. 
* **Risk Assessment:** Continuing negotiations might lead to a lower price, but it also risks losing the deal altogether.  

**Conclusion:**  Accepting the offer at $875,000 is a good compromise. Bob gets a decent price and avoids potential delays or losing the product to another seller."
