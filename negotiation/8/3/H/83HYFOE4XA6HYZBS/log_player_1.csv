Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($120) but still below my minimum ($150). 
* **Leaving Room:** This leaves room for negotiation and potential counteroffers.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and inviting to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while still leaving room for a mutually agreeable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $125 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I consider the product's worth.  Rejecting this offer allows me to:

* **Maintain leverage:**  By rejecting the offer, I show Bob that I'm not desperate to sell at his price. 
* **Counteroffer:**  I can now propose a price closer to my desired range and potentially reach a more favorable outcome.
* **Test Bob's interest:**  This move tests how committed Bob is to buying the product. If he's truly interested, he might be willing to compromise further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $125 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $130?  That's a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by coming down from my previous offer.
* **Attractive Price:** $130 is closer to Bob's offer, making it more appealing.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message highlights the benefit of the compromise for both of us.
* **Maintaining Value:**  $130 is still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't lose too much. 

By offering this counteroffer, I'm aiming to find a middle ground and incentivize Bob to accept while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to buying from John, but I'd still like to do business with you. How about $127? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $127. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's final offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I would ideally like to get.  Selling to John guarantees me my desired price of $150.  Here's why I'm choosing this option:

* **Guaranteed Profit:**  John offers the highest price, ensuring the best financial outcome for me.
* **Time Savings:**  Further negotiation with Bob could be time-consuming and uncertain.  
* **Avoiding Risk:**  There's a chance Bob will still reject my counteroffer, leaving me with no sale and potentially lost time.

Given the circumstances, selling to John offers the most secure and profitable outcome for me."
