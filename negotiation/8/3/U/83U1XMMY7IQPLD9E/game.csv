"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1100000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. This reflects its value to me while also giving you a good price.  Let's see if we can make this work.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 is a bit too low for me.  I understand the value of the product to you, and I'm willing to come down to $1000000.  This gives you a good deal while allowing me to get closer to my desired price. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1000000, but I'm still not quite there. My maximum budget for this product is $950000.  If you're willing to go that low, I'm ready to close the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",950000.0,Bob,4,
