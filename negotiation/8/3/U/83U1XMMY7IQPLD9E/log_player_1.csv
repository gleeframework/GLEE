{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a great price for a product worth so much to you. Let's work together to make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price close to my minimum acceptable value ($1,200,000) to maximize potential profit.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the value the product holds for Bob to incentivize him to accept the offer.
* **Negotiation Flexibility:**  Leaving room for negotiation allows me to potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Plan B:** Having John's offer as a backup gives me bargaining power. If Bob rejects my offer, I know I can still get my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1100000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. This reflects its value to me while also giving you a good price.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe there's room for negotiation. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** Knowing I can sell to John for $1,200,000 gives me leverage and allows me to be more assertive in negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  I understand the value of the product to you, and I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This gives you a good deal while allowing me to get closer to my desired price. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's a significant compromise from my initial offer but still closer to my desired value. 
* **Empathy:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's perspective while maintaining my own position.
* **Fairness:**  $1,000,000 is a fair price that accounts for both the product's value to Bob and my minimum acceptable value.
* **Urgency:** The message implies a willingness to negotiate further, but also sets a firm stance, encouraging Bob to respond quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1000000, but I'm still not quite there. My maximum budget for this product is $950000.  If you're willing to go that low, I'm ready to close the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the limit:**  Bob's offer of $950,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. 
* **Risk of further decline:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks him further lowering his offer. 
* **Guaranteed value:** Selling to John guarantees me my desired price, eliminating any risk of further negotiation or potential loss. 

While I'm open to negotiation, I need to prioritize maximizing my profit. In this case, John's offer provides the most secure and lucrative outcome."
