"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $180 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to sell it for $80. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $120. It's still a great deal considering the product's value and quality.",120.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $120 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $100, which is a fair compromise given our previous discussions. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to go with John's offer.",100.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $110. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",110.0,Alice,5,
