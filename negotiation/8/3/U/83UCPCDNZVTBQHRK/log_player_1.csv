"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe is worth a lot. I'm offering it to you first at a price of $20,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum value ($15,000). This gives me room to negotiate down while still getting a good profit. 
* **Positive and Engaging:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **High Value Emphasis:**  I'm highlighting the potential value of the product to create a sense of desirability."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $10,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $15,000. 
* **Opportunity to negotiate:** I believe there's room to negotiate a higher price with Bob, especially since he's expressed interest in the product. 
* **Potential for higher profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me $15,000, but by continuing to negotiate with Bob, I have the potential to earn more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $17,500, which is still a great deal considering the value of this product. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 17500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer and making a counter-offer.  
* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm coming down from my original offer, but still maintaining a price higher than my minimum. This shows I'm willing to compromise while also protecting my interests.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to consider a higher price. 
* **Focus on Compromise:** My message emphasizes finding a ""middle ground"" to create a positive negotiating tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $17500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12500 for it. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** Bob's offer of $12,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation room:**  While Bob has shown a willingness to compromise, there is still room for negotiation. 
* **Risk of losing out:**  Selling to John guarantees me $15,000, but I'm still trying to get a better price from Bob. 
* **Counter-offer strategy:** I will try to find a compromise price that works for both of us in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,500 just doesn't cover my costs. Let's split the difference: I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price closer to Bob's last offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Fair Price:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair price"" considering the value of the product, which can appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Emphasize Mutual Benefit:** I'm saying ""this gives us both a good deal,"" making it sound like a win-win situation. 
* **Pressure for a Decision:** I'm asking ""What do you say?"" to encourage Bob to respond quickly and avoid losing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but $14000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $13000 for it. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $13,000 is getting close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for Higher:**  However, I believe there's still room to negotiate a slightly higher price, especially since Bob has shown a willingness to compromise.
* **Risk of Losing Out:**  Selling to John guarantees me $15,000, but I'm still hoping to get closer to that price. 
* **Counter-offer Strategy:**  I will make a final counter-offer in the next round to try to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  $13,000 is getting closer, but I'm still just a little short of where I need to be. I'm willing to accept your offer if you can bump it up to $13,500.  This would be a fair compromise, and it's the best I can do at this point.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Counter-Offer:** This is likely my final counteroffer.
* **Slight Increase:** I'm only asking for a small increase from Bob's last offer ($500)  to show I'm willing to meet halfway.
* **Emphasize Compromise:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""fair compromise"" to make it sound appealing.
* **Pressure for Decision:** I'm asking Bob to ""let me know what you think"" to encourage a quick response and a final decision.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** This offer gets me closer to my target price while minimizing the risk of losing the deal. If Bob rejects this, I'll likely sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $13000 for it, and that's my final offer. I'm not willing to go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Bob's offer is his final one, and he's not willing to go any higher.
* **Below Minimum:** This price is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Limited Time:**  I'm running out of time, with only 2 rounds left.
* **Secure Deal:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price of $15,000. There is no guarantee that Bob will accept my counteroffer in the next round, and I risk ending up with nothing. 

It's better to take the guaranteed deal with John than risk losing the sale entirely."
