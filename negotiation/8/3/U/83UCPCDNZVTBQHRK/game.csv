"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe is worth a lot. I'm offering it to you first at a price of $20000. Let me know what you think!",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer, but $10000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $17500, which is still a great deal considering the value of this product. Let's find a middle ground.",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $17500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12500 for it. Can we meet in the middle?",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12500 just doesn't cover my costs. Let's split the difference: I'm willing to come down to $14000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a good deal. What do you say?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but $14000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $13000 for it. Can we meet at this price?",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  $13000 is getting closer, but I'm still just a little short of where I need to be. I'm willing to accept your offer if you can bump it up to $13500.  This would be a fair compromise, and it's the best I can do at this point.  Let me know what you think.",13500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $13000 for it, and that's my final offer. I'm not willing to go any higher.",13000.0,Bob,8,
