"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget, but it's not the best deal.**  You have room to negotiate and potentially get a better price. 
* **You can do better than $1,200,000.**  You know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, so there's definitely room for a lower price.
* **Buying from John is always an option, but it's a last resort.** He's offering the product at the maximum price you're willing to pay.  It's better to try to negotiate with Alice first."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns about the price, Bob. However, I believe the product's value is substantial, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $1,150,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's worth to you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still above your ideal price.** While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still not the best deal you can get.
* **You can still try to negotiate further.** You've already shown your willingness to negotiate, and Alice has already moved from her initial price. There's likely more room for compromise.
* **Buying from John is a last resort.** You're still closer to your desired price with Alice, so it's worth trying to negotiate further."
