"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, we believe it would be beneficial for both parties if you were to consider acquiring this item at a special introductory price of $950,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $950,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the introductory price, it's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to pay $800,000 for the product, which is a fair value for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $875,000 is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if Alice is willing to go lower. There's still room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $875,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $800,000, which is a fair price for the product's value.  Let's reach a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 800000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is getting closer, Bob is still determined to stick to his maximum budget of $800,000.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going, and there's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower. It's also a good strategy to keep Alice aware that Bob has a backup option (John) at $800,000."
