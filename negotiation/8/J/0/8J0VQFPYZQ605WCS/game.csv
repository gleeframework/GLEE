"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I have to balance that with the value the product holds for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I recognize the product's value, $850,000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we settle at $750,000? This offer represents a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $750,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $825,000. This is as low as I can go.",825000.0,Alice,5,
