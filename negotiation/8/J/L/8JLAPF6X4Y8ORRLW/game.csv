"Bob, it's great to connect with you about this. I'm excited to share this product with you as I know it can really benefit your work. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,500,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects its true worth.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your understanding of the product's value and your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,200,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this offer?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to find common ground. I'm ready to make this work, but I need a little more movement on your end. How about $1,300,000?  This is my final offer.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'd like to counteroffer $1,275,000. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
