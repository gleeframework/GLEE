Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows for a potential win-win scenario where Bob gets a good deal and I maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer of $9,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting his offer ensures a sale and a profit.  It's also a good starting point if I want to negotiate further with Bob in the future."
