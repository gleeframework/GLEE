"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product for $1,200,000. It's a significant investment, but I believe it will be highly profitable for you. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a great deal. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is below your maximum budget, you know John is willing to sell the same product for $1,000,000.  Therefore, it makes more financial sense to reject Alice's offer and secure the product at a lower price from John."
