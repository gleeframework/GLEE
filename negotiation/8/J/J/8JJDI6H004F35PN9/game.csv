"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. My initial offer is $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $18,000 is quite a bit higher than I was hoping to spend.  Would you consider a price closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I can meet you in the middle at $14,000, which is still a great value for this high-quality product. Would you be willing to consider this price?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $14,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  Could you do $11,000?  That would be a fair deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a fair deal, and I'm willing to meet you at a price that works for both of us. I can offer you a price of $13,500, which is a compromise between our previous offers. Would you be willing to accept this price?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer! How about $12,000? That's a significant move from my original offer and meets you closer to your desired price.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're getting close, Bob! I can see that you're willing to meet me in the middle, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still a bit above $12,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I can offer you the product for $13,000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll accept it.",13000.0,Alice,7,
