"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to maximize my potential profit.  I'm aware that I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,200,000 if Bob rejects this initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to explore further rounds with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,300,000. This is a significant compromise, but it still represents a decent profit for me. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a reasonable price and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 meets my minimum acceptable price. It's the best offer I've received so far, and accepting it would ensure a secure sale. While I could potentially try to get a higher price in further rounds, there's no guarantee of success. The risk of Bob rejecting my counteroffer or the negotiation dragging on for too long outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price. Therefore, I'm accepting Bob's offer."
