Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
