"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! The product is good, but your asking price is a little high for me. Would you consider a lower price of $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'm not ready to give up just yet.
