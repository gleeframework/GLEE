"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product before anyone else. I think you'll find it valuable. What would you say to a price of $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Even though the product is worth $120 to Alice, her offer of $140 is still lower than John's price of $150.
* **You're saving money:**  By accepting Alice's offer, you save $10 compared to buying from John."
