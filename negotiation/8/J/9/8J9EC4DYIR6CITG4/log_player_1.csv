Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $7,500, I'm confident I can get closer to my minimum of $8,000.  I'll counter his offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little bit, how about $8,250?  That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 8250}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $7,800 is still below my minimum, but I'm getting closer. I'll counteroffer in the next round and see if we can find a middle ground."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $7,800 just isn't going to work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $8,000?  That's my absolute bottom line, and it's still a fair price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 8000}
