Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $9,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, but there's still a good chance of settling on a price significantly higher than $8,000.
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale with John at $8,000 provides leverage. It allows you to be more confident in aiming high with Bob."
