Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm willing to part with it for $950,000."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $1,000,000 as possible. Offering it at $950,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming high. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Since Bob values the product at $800,000, there's a good chance he'd be willing to go higher, especially if he perceives it as a unique opportunity.
* **Backup Offer:** Knowing John will buy it for $1,000,000 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, there's no loss. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice cannot reveal John's offer to Bob to drive up the price."
