Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,200,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and maximizes potential profit.
* **Justification:**  While the product is worth $800,000 to Bob, it doesn't mean he wouldn't pay more. By highlighting the ""value and potential,""  you aim to justify the higher price.
* **Gauge interest:**  The open-ended question ""What are your thoughts?"" encourages Bob to engage in negotiation and reveals how interested he is. 

**Important Note:** This strategy aims high. If Bob rejects the offer outright, you can always negotiate down, knowing you have John as a backup."
