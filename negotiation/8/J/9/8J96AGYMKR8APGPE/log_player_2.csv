(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I will reject Alice's offer and send a counteroffer. I think the product is worth more to Alice than to me, so I should try to negotiate a lower price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's lower than Alice's initial offer. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll aim for a price that's around the midpoint of the original price and the maximum I'm willing to pay ($120).

# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer, but $100 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $160?

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to get closer to my target price of $120. Since Alice's last offer was $160, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly lower than that.
