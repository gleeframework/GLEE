"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,800,000. I'm confident this is a fair reflection of its worth, but I'm open to discussing further.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree your product is good, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider a price of $1,500,000. This feels like a fairer compromise.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  $1,500,000 is still a bit too steep for me though. How about $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here, but I have to be honest, $1,000,000 is too low for me to consider. I'm willing to accept $1,300,000  â€“ it's a firm offer, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we're getting close.  How about we split the difference - $1,150,000, and we have a deal?",1150000.0,Bob,6,
