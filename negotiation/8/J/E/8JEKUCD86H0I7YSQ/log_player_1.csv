Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. I'm confident this deal will be mutually beneficial."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price close to Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on mutual benefit:** Highlighting the potential for a ""win-win"" situation encourages Bob to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  $950,000 allows for potential counteroffers without dropping below my minimum acceptable price ($800,000).  

This strategy aims to secure a good price while keeping the negotiation open and allowing for potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $950,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $820,000. I believe this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum:** While $820,000 is close to my minimum, I believe I can still squeeze a bit more out of this negotiation.
* **Potential for a higher offer:**  Bob is willing to negotiate and clearly sees value in the product. This suggests a chance for a counteroffer closer to my initial $950,000.
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting, I maintain control of the negotiation and show Bob I'm serious about getting a fair price. 

I'll counteroffer with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, aiming to close the gap while still maximizing my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $820,000 is still slightly below what I can accept at this time. I'm willing to compromise and come down to $875,000. This price reflects the value of the product while allowing for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can bridge the gap and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise, but not too much:** This counteroffer shows willingness to compromise but avoids dropping too low. $875,000 is a reasonable middle ground.
* **Reinforcing value:**  Reiterating the value of the product emphasizes the worth of the offer and encourages Bob to consider the deal seriously.
* **Positive framing:** ""Mutually beneficial"" and ""make this deal happen"" foster a collaborative tone, signaling openness to a final agreement.

This approach aims to strike a balance between securing a good price and keeping the negotiation moving towards a successful outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I value your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget and the current market situation, I am proposing a counteroffer of $850,000. I believe this brings us closer to an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:**  Bob's counteroffer of $850,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Further negotiation may not yield a significantly better outcome.  There's a risk of Bob walking away completely, leaving me with the less desirable option of selling to John for $800,000.
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing negotiations would require more time and effort, with an uncertain outcome. 

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a good price that is close to my minimum and avoids the potential downsides of further negotiation."
