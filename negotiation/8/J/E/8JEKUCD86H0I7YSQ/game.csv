"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $950,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $820,000. I believe this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",820000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $820,000 is still slightly below what I can accept at this time. I'm willing to compromise and come down to $875,000. This price reflects the value of the product while allowing for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can bridge the gap and make this deal happen.",875000.0,Alice,3,
