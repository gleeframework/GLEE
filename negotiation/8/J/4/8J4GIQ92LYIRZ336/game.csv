"I understand you're trying to get the best price for the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $13000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price?",13000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you've reached your limit, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $13000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $14000 for it. How about we meet in the middle at $13500?",13500.0,Alice,7,
