"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I believe it would be a great fit for your needs. I'm offering it to you for $11,000.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can potentially get the product for a lower price than $11,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $11,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $10,500 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,750?  It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,750 is closer to your budget, it's still above your target of $10,000.  Since you have a guaranteed alternative with John for $10,000, it's more advantageous to buy from John and avoid further negotiation."
