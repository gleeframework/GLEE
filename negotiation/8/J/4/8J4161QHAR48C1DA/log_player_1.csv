Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I believe it would be a great fit for your needs. I'm offering it to you for $11,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $11,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly tone to encourage Bob to engage in the conversation.
* **Flexibility:** I'm prepared to negotiate, but I'm not giving away the product for less than $12,000 since I have John as a backup buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $11,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $10,500 is less than my minimum price of $12,000. 
* **I have a backup buyer:**  John is willing to pay my minimum price, so I'm not under pressure to accept a lower offer.
* **Potential for higher offer:** I can counteroffer and try to get a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $10,500 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,750?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not giving away too much.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:**  I'm using friendly language to keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Still above my minimum:**  $10,750 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000."
