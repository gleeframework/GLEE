""message"": ""Hello Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to your company, even more so than it is to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,450,000. I think that's a fair price considering its potential worth to you."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product has potential, your asking price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum and its actual value to him. There's plenty of room for negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,100,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. This product has the potential to generate substantial returns for your business, and I'm confident its true value is much higher.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value this product could bring, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Let's try to find a compromise. How about $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob is now offering your minimum acceptable price. While you could try to push for more, there's a risk he won't go higher. Accepting guarantees you get your minimum and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether."
