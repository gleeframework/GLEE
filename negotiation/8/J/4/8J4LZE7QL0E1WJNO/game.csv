"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product has potential, your asking price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,100,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. This product has the potential to generate substantial returns for your business, and I'm confident its true value is much higher.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
