**Reasoning:**

While we could continue negotiating, Bob is consistently increasing his offer and we are now at $1,700,000. This is a significant amount above John's offer of $1,500,000.  

Continuing to push for a higher price risks Bob walking away, leaving us to accept the guaranteed $1,500,000. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing a significant profit."
