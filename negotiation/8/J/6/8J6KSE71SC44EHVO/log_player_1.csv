"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This is a strong opening that leaves room for negotiation while still reflecting the product's minimum value to me.  I want to see if Bob is serious about buying and gauge his initial interest level."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $15,000 is my minimum, I believe I can do better.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I want to see how serious he is about buying the product, and if he's willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm going to counter with $18,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaves some room for a potential higher price.  I'm hoping this encourages Bob to come up a bit, but I'm ready to walk away if necessary and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $16,000. While it's still below my initial asking price, it's above my minimum and a reasonable compromise. I don't want to risk going through more rounds and potentially losing the deal altogether.  With only 6 rounds left, I'm choosing to secure the sale."
