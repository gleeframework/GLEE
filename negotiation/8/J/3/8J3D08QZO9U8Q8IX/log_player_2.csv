Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make an offer. However, I need to make a profit, and $10,000 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11,500.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm still not comfortable going below $12,000, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you at $11,250, which is a fair price for both of us. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $11,250 saves a significant amount compared to John's $15,000 price."
