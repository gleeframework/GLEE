"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value.",10500.0,Alice,3,
