"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to negotiate a little to make this deal happen. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,500 is too close to your maximum budget. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better price, potentially pushing her closer to her minimum acceptable price of $12,000."
