I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,750,000. This gives him a good deal as the product is worth $1,500,000 to him, but it also ensures I get a better price than what John is offering.  I'm confident that Bob will be motivated to negotiate further, as this is a valuable product for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,400,000. I need to make at least $1,500,000. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,600,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it still ensures I get a good profit. I'm confident Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to sell the product to Bob, his offer of $1,450,000 is still too low for me.  I'm not willing to go lower than $1,500,000, and John has already offered that amount. It's time to move on and secure a guaranteed sale."
