Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $200. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 200
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:** By saying ""I think it would be perfect for you,"" Alice adds a bit of personalization that might make Bob more inclined to accept. 
* **Clear Ask:** Alice makes it clear what she's asking for, avoiding any confusion.

**Important Note:** While Alice knows John will buy the product for $150, she doesn't want to reveal this information to Bob. This gives her leverage in the negotiation."
