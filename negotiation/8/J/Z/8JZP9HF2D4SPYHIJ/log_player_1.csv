Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $115.  It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that is a bit higher than my minimum but lower than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate while still maximizing my potential profit.  The message also tries to frame the offer as a win-win situation for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $105 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum desired profit. I'll reject Bob's counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. $110 is getting closer. How about we settle at $108? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $108 is still below my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum and significantly better than selling to John for $100.  The negotiation has gone back and forth a few times, and it's likely that Bob won't go any higher.  Accepting his offer ensures I make a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation or losing the sale entirely."
