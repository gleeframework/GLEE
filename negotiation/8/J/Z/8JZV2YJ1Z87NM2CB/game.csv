"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $8,500. It's a good price for both of us, and I think we can make a deal at this point.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  How about we split the difference from our previous offers and settle at $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $8,000. I'm willing to go a bit higher, so how about $8,800? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",8800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still very interested in the product, but $8,800 is a bit too high for my budget. I can do $8,200, which is a fair compromise considering your last offer and my previous one.",8200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway on the last offer, so how about $8,500? It's a fair price that I think we can both agree on.",8500.0,Alice,7,
