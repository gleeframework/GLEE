"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product. Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $11,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's find a middle ground. ",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down a bit further, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",10500.0,Bob,4,
