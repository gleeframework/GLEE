"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, knowing Bob might counter. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive tone:**  A friendly message encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for counter-offers:**  $110 is above Bob's perceived value, but not so high that it immediately makes him walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $90 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to my target price.

**Next Round Strategy:**

* I will likely counter with a price between $90 and $100, aiming to find a compromise that's acceptable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I can do $95, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're still interested."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price closer to Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still protecting my minimum.
* **Finality:**  The message implies this is my last offer, adding a sense of urgency to encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Maintain some room for negotiation:** $95 is still higher than Bob's offer, leaving some room for potential further counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Negotiation isn't productive:** Bob is consistently offering prices below my acceptable range. 
* **John's offer is a safe alternative:**  Selling to John for $100 ensures I receive my minimum price and avoids further negotiation with Bob, who might not be willing to compromise."
