Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $9,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price.  While $8,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about $9,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,000 is still too high for me. I'm happy to pay $8,750. It's a fair price, and we can close this deal quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,750 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a price closer to $9,000. There's still time to negotiate."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're close. How about we split the difference? $8,875. It's a fair price, and we can close this deal right now.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8875}
