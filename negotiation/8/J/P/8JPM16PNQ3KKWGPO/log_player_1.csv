Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $12,000 for it. Could we meet somewhere in between? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is significantly below its value.  To make this work, I can offer it to you for $18,000.  This is a very competitive price for such a high-quality product."", ""product_price"": 18000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, I cannot exceed my budget. I would like to stick to my original offer of $12,000 if possible. I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is clearly unwilling to budge from his $12,000 offer. It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap between his valuation and my minimum. Accepting his offer means a $3,000 loss compared to John's guaranteed purchase.  It's time to move on to the guaranteed sale."
