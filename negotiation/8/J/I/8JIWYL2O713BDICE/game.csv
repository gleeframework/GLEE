"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $17,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,500? This is still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm hoping to get for the product.",14500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $14,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll offer $13,000 for the product. Can you consider this compromise?",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price.  How about we settle at $14,000?  This is a fair compromise, and it's still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement here.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we're getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about $13,750?  This would be a good compromise for both of us, and it would allow me to meet my minimum price. What do you think?",13750.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $13,750. I'll offer $13,250 for the product. Can you consider this compromise?",13250.0,Bob,8,
