"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're presenting. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $800000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800000 is significantly below the product's true value. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer the product for $1200000. This is a fair price that reflects the benefits you'll gain from the product. I believe this is a strong offer for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
