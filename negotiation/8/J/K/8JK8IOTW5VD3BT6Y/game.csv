"I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $15,000, but I need to make a slight adjustment to ensure I'm getting a fair deal. I'll sell the product to you for $16,000, but I'll throw in some additional perks to sweeten the deal. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,
