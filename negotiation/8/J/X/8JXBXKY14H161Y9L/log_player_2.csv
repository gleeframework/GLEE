"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $900,000 is better than John's offer of $1,200,000. 
* However, the product is worth $800,000 to Alice. There's definitely room for negotiation. 
* Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. Considering the value to you, I'd be willing to pay $750,000.  This would give you a significant profit and allows me to acquire the product at a price that works for my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a better return on my investment. Considering the value of the product to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $850,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair for both of us.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

* Alice's offer of $850,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's lower than his initial budget of $1,200,000 and lower than John's offer. 
* Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product at a favorable price without risking further negotiation that could lead to a higher price or a stalemate."
