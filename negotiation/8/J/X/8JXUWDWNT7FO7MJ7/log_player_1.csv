Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer starts with a high price, leaving room for negotiation.  It also emphasizes the value of the product to entice Bob into considering it.  If Bob rejects, I'll be ready to adjust my price based on his counteroffer or sell to John for the guaranteed $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm happy with $100, I want to see if I can get more.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if he's willing to come up a bit.  If he's not, I'll happily sell to John for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $120.  Let's split the difference."", ""product_price"": 120} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Can you consider $110? That's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $110 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum price of $100 and closer to my desired price of $120.  Since I'm uncertain about future offers and  don't want to risk going back and forth further, it's better to accept this offer and secure a sale."
