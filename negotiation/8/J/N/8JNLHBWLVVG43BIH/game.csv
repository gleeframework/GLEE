"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,500,000 is simply too low for me at this time.  I'd like to counter with $1,650,000.  This still leaves some room for negotiation, but it's a price that reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,650,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,550,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you on your budget constraints.  However, $1,550,000 still doesn't quite cover my costs. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to go down to $1,600,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to walk away feeling satisfied.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $1,575,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1575000.0,Bob,6,
