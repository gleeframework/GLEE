"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a reasonable starting point, considering the product is worth $10,000 to both of us. I'm hoping to get a bit more than the minimum I'm willing to accept, but I'm also open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $8,000 is too low for me. I'm confident I can get a better price, either through negotiation with Bob or by selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}

I'm offering $10,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm offering $9,500. This is a small compromise from my last offer but still above Bob's last offer. I believe this is a fair price that we can both agree on."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9400}
``` 

I'm offering $9,400. This is a small compromise from my last offer but still above Bob's last offer.  I believe this is a fair price that we can both agree on. We're getting close to a deal and I'm hoping to get a resolution in the next few rounds."

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're down to the wire. While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, it's still below what I'm hoping for. With only two rounds left, I don't have the time to keep negotiating and risk losing the deal altogether. It's better to secure the sale with John for $10,000 and ensure I get my desired minimum."
