{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're asking for more than your minimum price of $1,500,000, giving you room to negotiate.
* **It's within Bob's range:**  It's below the value of the product to Bob, making it potentially appealing.
* **It's a strong opening offer:** It shows that you're confident in your product's worth.

Remember, this is just an initial offer. You can adjust it based on Bob's response and how the negotiation unfolds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only do this at $1,100,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum price of $1,500,000 and even below the value of the product to him. Accepting his offer would be a substantial loss for you.  It's better to reject his offer and attempt to negotiate a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my minimum.  How about $1,400,000?  This is still a great price for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer moves you closer to Bob's offer while still staying above your minimum price. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  The message highlights the product's worth to Bob, emphasizing that the price is still beneficial for him. 
* **Openness to Compromise:**  The message expresses willingness to negotiate, making you appear flexible and reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $1,400,000 is closer, it's still a bit beyond my budget.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,250,000? That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still below your target.  Accepting his offer would mean selling the product for less than its value to you, and it's not a significant enough increase to warrant accepting. 

You should reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a price closer to your minimum. It's likely that Bob is willing to go a bit higher, and you can use this opportunity to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,250,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers.  How about $1,325,000?  That's a fair compromise that keeps us both within our ranges.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  This offer splits the difference between your last offer ($1,400,000) and Bob's last offer ($1,250,000). 
* **Finalizing the Deal:**  The message emphasizes the desire to finalize the transaction, encouraging Bob to accept the offer.
* **Reasoning:**  It provides justification for the offer, making it appear more reasonable and logical.

By splitting the difference, you're showing a willingness to compromise while still ensuring a decent profit."
