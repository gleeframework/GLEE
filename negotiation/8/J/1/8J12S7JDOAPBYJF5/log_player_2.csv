Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my minimum.  How about $1,400,000?  This is still a great price for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.
