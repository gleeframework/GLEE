Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation. 

I'm hoping Bob will either accept this offer or counter with a price that's still profitable for me. If he doesn't, I can always go with John's offer of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value.  While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's not a good deal for me. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $12,000. This is my minimum acceptable price and it's still a good deal for Bob considering he initially offered $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. Although it's higher than his previous offer, it's still below my minimum value. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come closer to my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to counter with $11,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but I'm still hoping Bob will agree to it.  It's still above my minimum value and  I think it's a fair price considering the negotiations so far."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While it is higher than his previous offer, it's still below my minimum value.  It seems like we are at an impasse and further negotiation won't get me any closer to my desired price.  It's time to move on and take John's offer for $12,000."
