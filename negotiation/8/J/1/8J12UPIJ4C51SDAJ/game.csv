"I'm interested in the product, but $950000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. Can you meet me at that price?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $900000? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $900000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $880000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",880000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're willing to go up to $880000, but I'm not willing to give up much more value. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $915000? It's a bit higher than my initial offer, but it's still a good deal considering the product's value.",915000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I'm comfortable with $915000. I was thinking more along the lines of $870000. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle, but I really like this product and would like to make a deal. Can you meet me at $870000?",870000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about this product, Bob. I'm willing to make one last concession. I can meet you at $885000. It's a bit higher than your latest offer, but I'm willing to compromise to make the deal happen. What do you think?",885000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $885000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $855000. Can you meet me at that price?",855000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much value. I can meet you at $875000. It's a bit higher than your latest offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this works for you.",875000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a good deal, but I really like this product. I'm making one last offer: $845000. This is my absolute maximum, and I won't go any lower. Please let me know if you can meet me at this price.",845000.0,Bob,10,
