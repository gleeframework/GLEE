Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a fantastic deal for you, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting at $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) but still gives me a good profit margin. 
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message positive and focused on the value Bob will get. I'm not mentioning my minimum price to avoid anchoring him to a lower value. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to strike a balance:

* **Attractive offer:**  $1,000,000 is a compelling price for Bob, considering he values the product at $800,000.
* **Room for negotiation:**  I've left room for counteroffers without immediately pushing Bob away. 
* **Backup plan:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $1,200,000 gives me confidence in walking away if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $600,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, and it's even significantly lower than my initial offer. Accepting this would be a major loss.
* **Opportunity for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it shows his interest.  I have a chance to counteroffer and try to find a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Selling to John is a guaranteed win:**  Even though negotiation with Bob could potentially yield a higher price,  selling to John immediately guarantees me my minimum acceptable price. However, there's a chance I can do better with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price that is closer to my minimum price, but still leaving room for further negotiation. I'll also emphasize the value of the product to him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns. While $600,000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price reflects the significant value this product offers and leaves room for us both to benefit. Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer price:** $850,000 is significantly closer to my minimum price ($1,200,000) but still leaves some room for negotiation, making it a realistic counteroffer.
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's concerns and highlight the product's value, framing it as a win-win scenario.  I avoid mentioning my minimum price to avoid anchoring the negotiation too low.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Show flexibility:** By reducing my price, I demonstrate my willingness to negotiate and find a solution.
* **Maintain my position:** The price is still above Bob's initial offer, showing I'm not willing to compromise too much.
* **Open the door for more discussion:** The message encourages further negotiation and sets the stage for a possible compromise.

By using this strategy, I can hopefully find a mutually agreeable price without resorting to selling to John immediately, potentially maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and settle at $725,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While $725,000 is higher than his previous offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Accepting this would result in a substantial loss. 
* **Opportunity for negotiation:**  Bob's counteroffer shows his ongoing interest and willingness to negotiate further. I have a chance to make a final counteroffer and potentially reach a more acceptable price.
* **Selling to John is a good option:**  While I'd prefer a better price from Bob, selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, which is significantly better than Bob's current offer.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob one last time with a price that's closer to my minimum but still reflects the value of the product. If he rejects this final offer, I will sell the product to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're getting close. To make this work, I'm willing to drop to $900,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows for a good deal for both of us. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Counteroffer:**  $900,000 is a significant compromise from my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) but still gives me a decent profit margin. It's also a reasonable middle ground considering Bob's offer of $725,000.
* **Message:** I frame it as a ""final offer"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept. I reiterate the value of the product and emphasize the mutual benefit.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Maximize Profit:** $900,000 is the highest price I'm willing to go, while still staying within a range that could be acceptable to Bob.
* **End Negotiation:** I've stated this is my final offer to signal that I'm serious and willing to walk away if he rejects it.
* **Increase Acceptance Chance:** By making a final, concrete offer, I increase the likelihood of Bob accepting, as he knows rejecting it means losing the deal.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this final counteroffer, I will move forward with selling the product to John for $1,200,000 to ensure I don't lose out on a profitable sale."
