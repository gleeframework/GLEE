# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is within his budget, it's still higher than Alice's value for the product.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  How about we split the difference and I pay $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save a bit, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. How about we meet in the middle at $14,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While $14,500 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price.  He's willing to continue negotiating to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $14,500 is still a little too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway again and offer $13,750.  Let's see if we can find a common ground."", ""product_price"": 13750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to make a bit more than $13,750. How about we try $14,200? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best deal.  While Alice has lowered her price to $14,200, it's still above what Bob is willing to pay. He's going to continue negotiating and see if he can get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I think we're getting closer, but $14,200 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,950? This would be a good compromise for both of us, and we can finally close the deal."", ""product_price"": 13950}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you at $13,950, but I'd like to try to get a bit more. How about we go to $14,050? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,050
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been steadily lowering the price, and Alice has been willing to negotiate.  While $14,050 is still a bit higher than Bob's ideal price, it's a good compromise considering the negotiation has been going on for a while.  Accepting the offer avoids the risk of Alice further increasing the price or Bob having to buy from John at a higher cost."
