,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  How about we split the difference and I pay $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save a bit, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. How about we meet in the middle at $14,500?",14500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $14,500 is still a little too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway again and offer $13,750.  Let's see if we can find a common ground.",13750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to make a bit more than $13,750. How about we try $14,200?",14200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I think we're getting closer, but $14,200 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,950? This would be a good compromise for both of us, and we can finally close the deal.",13950.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you at $13,950, but I'd like to try to get a bit more. How about we go to $14,050?",14050.0,Alice,7,
