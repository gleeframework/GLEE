Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, but it still leaves room for negotiation. I'm curious to see what Bob's reaction will be."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, so I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $12,000. This is still higher than Bob's offer and my minimum acceptable price, but it shows that I'm willing to negotiate.  I hope this will encourage him to increase his offer."
