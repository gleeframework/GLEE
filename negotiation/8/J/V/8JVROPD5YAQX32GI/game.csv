"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the pricing.  While $1,200,000 is a significant amount, the true value of this product, in terms of the benefits it can bring you, is far greater.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,275,000?",1275000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit above that number. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,225,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
