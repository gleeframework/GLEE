{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's in your best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You still have the option of buying from John as a backup if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation. This counteroffer represents a 50% discount, which is a substantial reduction. By offering a price that's closer to my maximum budget, I'm hoping to encourage Alice to engage in further negotiation."

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $900,000. This is still below Alice's offer, but closer to her revised price.  This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still staying within a reasonable range. It also puts pressure on Alice to consider my offer seriously."
