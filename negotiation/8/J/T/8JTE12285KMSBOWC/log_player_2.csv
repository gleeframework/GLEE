"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Therefore, it's better to reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John for $8,000."
