"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I believe it holds the same value for you.  To start, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $900,000.  Let's find a compromise.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  The product is worth $1,000,000 to me, and I'm confident its value to you is similar.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which I believe is a fair price given the product's value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. The product has a significant value, and I'm confident you recognize that.  To demonstrate my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price is fair to both of us, reflecting the product's worth and allowing for a successful deal.  Let's work together to finalize this transaction.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
