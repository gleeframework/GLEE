"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I think $1,400,000 is a little steep.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While I value your business, $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,300,000, which is still a fair price considering the value this product brings to your company.  What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,300,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,200,000.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
