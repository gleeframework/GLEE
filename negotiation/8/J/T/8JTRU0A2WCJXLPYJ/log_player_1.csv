{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. It's a unique opportunity for your business, and I believe it will generate significant returns for you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,400,000, which reflects its exceptional value. Please let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I think $1,400,000 is a little steep.  Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $1,100,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm hoping to get closer to my asking price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While I value your business, $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,300,000, which is still a fair price considering the value this product brings to your company.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,300,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,200,000.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's above my minimum threshold and a reasonable compromise. I'd rather close the deal now than risk further negotiation and potentially lose the sale altogether."
