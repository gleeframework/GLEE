"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $150. I think it's a great value and I'm confident you'll love it!",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but would you consider a price closer to $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $100? It's a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $100 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  Could you maybe do $75? That would be a great deal for both of us.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $75 is still a bit lower than my minimum price, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $90? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Alice,5,
