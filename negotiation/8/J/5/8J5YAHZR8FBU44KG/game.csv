"Alice, $17000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in your product, but I'm only willing to pay $12000.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $12000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $15000? That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I'm still interested in your product. How about we split the difference and go with $13500? This would allow both of us to walk away feeling good about the deal.",13500.0,Bob,4,
