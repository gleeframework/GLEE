Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm offering the product for $100. This is higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($120). 
* **Negotiation Space:** This offer leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can adjust my price slightly depending on his counteroffer. 
* **John as Backup:** Knowing John is willing to pay $120 provides me with a safety net. If negotiations with Bob fall through, I can sell to John without losing money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $100 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While $85 is closer to my minimum, there's still room for negotiation. I can counteroffer with a price closer to $100.
* **John's Offer:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $120, but I'd prefer to try to get closer to my initial asking price.

**Next Steps:**  I'll counteroffer Bob with a price between $85 and $100, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While $85 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $95. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. "", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer of $95 is a compromise, moving halfway between my previous offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $85.
* **Maintaining Value:** $95 is still above Bob's perceived value of $80, but it allows for potential negotiation.
* **John as Safety Net:** Remember, selling to John for $120 remains an option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $95 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $90. Let's see if we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Deal:** Bob's offer of $90 is only $10 away from my previous counteroffer of $100.  This is a reasonable compromise, and it's getting closer to my desired price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I'd prefer to get closer to $100, there's a risk that further negotiation might result in Bob walking away entirely. 
* **John's Offer:** Selling to John for $120 is still an option, but at this point, accepting Bob's offer secures a sale that's closer to my preferred price. 

**Decision:** It's in my best interest to accept Bob's offer of $90 and close the deal."
