"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $160?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $160 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's compromise at $120.  That's a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here. How about we split the difference again and settle at $140? This is my final offer.",140.0,Alice,5,
