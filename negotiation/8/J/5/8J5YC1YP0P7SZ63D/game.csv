"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering the potential of this product, but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me at this stage.  I'm willing to pay $950,000. This reflects the value I see in the product while also giving you a good profit margin. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate your perspective on the product's value. While $950,000 is certainly a tempting offer, I believe the true value of this product is reflected closer to the $1 million mark.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value. While I recognize its potential, $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, which is a fair price considering my assessment of the product and leaves room for both of us to gain.  Let's aim for a deal that works for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you've been a pleasure to negotiate with and I appreciate you working with me on this. Let's make this final offer to avoid wasting each other's time.  If you can meet me at $1,000,000, we have a deal. This ensures a fair outcome for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
