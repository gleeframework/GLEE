Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. It's a fantastic deal on a product I know you'll find valuable."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay slightly less. This allows me to potentially earn a bit more.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The price of $11,999 is just below my minimum acceptable price and significantly above Bob's perceived value. This creates the impression of a ""deal"" while still ensuring a healthy profit if Bob accepts.
* **Alternative Option:** If Bob rejects the offer, I'm not losing anything. I can proceed with selling to John at my desired price."
