"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $1,125,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,5,
