Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. I think this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?,1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's uniqueness, $1800000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1300000 for it. This is a serious offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1300000 is a bit below my expectations, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price around $1600000. This is a good middle ground that still reflects the product's value. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1600000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident I can find a similar product for that price elsewhere.  However, I'm still interested in this particular item.  I'm willing to go up to $1450000.  This is my final offer, let's see if we can close the deal.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1450000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you $1550000, which is a significant compromise on my part. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your compromise. $1550000 is closer to my budget, but I'm still a bit hesitant.  I'm willing to pay $1500000. This is my absolute maximum, as I have another option available at that price.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",1500000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1500000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll offer you $1575000, which is still a good price considering the product's value. I'm not willing to go any lower, so I hope you can meet me in the middle. What do you think?",1575000.0,Alice,7,
