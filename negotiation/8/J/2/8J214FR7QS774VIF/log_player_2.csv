"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. I think this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to initiate a counteroffer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's uniqueness, $1,800,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it. This is a serious offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1300000 is a bit below my expectations, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price around $1600000. This is a good middle ground that still reflects the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000.  It's worth continuing to negotiate, hoping to drive the price down further.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer, potentially bringing the price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident I can find a similar product for that price elsewhere.  However, I'm still interested in this particular item.  I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000.  This is my final offer, let's see if we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1450000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you $1550000, which is a significant compromise on my part. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,550,000 is still slightly above Bob's maximum budget.  Since Bob has a guaranteed alternative with John, there's no immediate need to accept.  Rejecting allows for one more counteroffer to try to get the price down to $1,500,000 or very close. If Alice doesn't budge further, Bob can then purchase from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your compromise. $1,550,000 is closer to my budget, but I'm still a bit hesitant.  I'm willing to pay $1,500,000. This is my absolute maximum, as I have another option available at that price.  Let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1500000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll offer you $1575000, which is still a good price considering the product's value. I'm not willing to go any lower, so I hope you can meet me in the middle. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,575,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,575,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,575,000 is still above Bob's budget, and he's only got 3 rounds left.  While another counteroffer might be possible, the risk of losing the deal with John is too high.  With John's offer being a guaranteed $1,500,000, it's the most sensible option at this point."
