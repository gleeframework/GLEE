"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product, considering its value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,200,000 undervalues its potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I still think $1,300,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm confident that's a fair price for the product.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your position and your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle on $1,275,000? This reflects the value of the product while still being a fair deal for you.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,275,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,225,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a fair price, but I need to be mindful of my budget.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
