Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $1,100,000 gives me a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value. 
* **Positive framing:**  The message emphasizes the ""great deal"" and ""fair price"" to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Keeping John in mind:** I'm aware that John is willing to pay $1,200,000, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort, but I would like to propose a price of $1,050,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired value.  
* **Negotiation potential:**  I believe I can still push for a higher price by making a counteroffer.
* **John as leverage:** Having John as an option gives me confidence to reject Bob's offer and keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,080,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. "", ""product_price"": 1080000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by reducing my price, but I'm not giving in completely.  
* **Focus on value:**  I reiterate the product's value to justify my price.
* **""Meeting in the middle"" language:** This encourages Bob to see this as a reasonable compromise. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** I'm still above Bob's offer, and I'm aware I can always go to John for a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I am unable to agree to $1,080,000. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,060,000. This feels closer to a fair compromise given our respective positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $1,060,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Limited room for improvement:**  I've already lowered my price twice, and further negotiations might not yield a significantly higher offer from Bob.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If I reject, there's a chance Bob will walk away, and I might end up with nothing. 
* **Time is money:** Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick sale and allows me to move on to other opportunities."
