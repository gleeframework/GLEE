"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I believe this is a fair price given its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is quite high considering her product's worth to her is significantly lower. I should try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still potentially profitable for her. This leaves room for negotiation while signaling my interest in a lower price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a fair price given the value of the product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is slowly moving towards a more reasonable price, but it's still above her product's worth and my ideal budget. I will continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand your position. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 9750
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer slightly to show willingness to negotiate, but still aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's latest offer.  The goal is to find a price point that benefits both of us."
