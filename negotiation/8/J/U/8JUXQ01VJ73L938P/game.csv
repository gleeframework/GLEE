"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at $1,500,000 for you, and I'm confident it can bring significant value to your business. My starting price is $1,200,000, which is a fair reflection of its worth.  Let's discuss further and find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, I believe $1,200,000 is a bit high for this product. I'm prepared to offer $900,000. Let me know if this works for you.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, I'm still firm on the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price reflects the significant benefits you'll gain from this product, and it leaves room for both of us to be satisfied. Let's find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, I need to be mindful of my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $975,000.  This is a fair price and I'm hopeful we can close the deal.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $975,000 doesn't fully reflect the value this product will bring to your company. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This offer still represents a great deal for both of us, and allows you to secure a valuable asset.  Let's make this deal happen.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
