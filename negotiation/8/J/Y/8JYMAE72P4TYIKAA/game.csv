"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, $125 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $105 for it. Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While $105 is a fair price, I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my original offer. I'm willing to come down to $115. This still leaves some room for both of us to be satisfied.  What do you say?",115.0,Alice,3,
