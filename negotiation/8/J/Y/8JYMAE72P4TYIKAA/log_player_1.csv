Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be interested in. It's worth at least $150 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $125. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, $125 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $105 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  $105 is too close to my minimum, and I think I can get closer to $125."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $105 is a fair price, I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my original offer. I'm willing to come down to $115. This still leaves some room for both of us to be satisfied.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 115}
