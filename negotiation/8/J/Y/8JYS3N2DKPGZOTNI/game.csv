"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $115 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. Would you be willing to go down to $105?  I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price would be fair for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. I can't go all the way down to $105, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110.  This is still a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for being flexible.  $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $108, which is right in the middle between our last offers. If you're open to that, I'm ready to finalize the deal.",108.0,Bob,4,
