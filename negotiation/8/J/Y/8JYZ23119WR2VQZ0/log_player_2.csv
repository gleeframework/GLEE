"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is too high. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my interest.  While I see the value in this product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  This counteroffer starts at a lower price than Alice's offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Realistic Range:**  $1,250,000 is still above Alice's minimum ($1,200,000), so it's a potential point of compromise.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** It allows room for potential back-and-forth in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, and understand your position. However,  $1,250,000 is below my bottom line. Would you consider meeting in the middle at $1,325,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still acknowledging the product's true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for negotiation.
* **Staying Strategic:** Bob wants to save as much as possible, so accepting this offer is not the most advantageous move.
* **Counteroffer Potential:** By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to further lower the price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,325,000 is closer, but it's still slightly out of my range.  Let's split the difference. How about $1,300,000? I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer is a compromise between Bob's previous counteroffer ($1,250,000) and Alice's latest offer ($1,325,000).
* **Fairness:**  The message emphasizes a desire for a fair deal that benefits both parties.
* **Closing the Gap:**  This counteroffer brings Bob closer to Alice's bottom line while still allowing room for further negotiation if needed."
