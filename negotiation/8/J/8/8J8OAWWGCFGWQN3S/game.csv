"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high value to you, I propose we start with a price of $14000. This is above its intrinsic worth to me but below its perceived value to you. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to make a counteroffer.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $12500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the product's value. I would like to counter with a price of $13500. This is higher than my initial offer and slightly lower than your proposal, aiming to find a middle ground. Please let me know if this works for you or if you wish to make another counteroffer.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still think $13000 is a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $13000, but I'd like to make a slight adjustment to $12800. This is the highest I'm willing to go.",12800.0,Bob,4,
