"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, given its potential. I'm initially suggesting a price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to offer $950,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm confident that this product offers you significant value beyond the $950,000 mark. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This reflects the true worth of what you're getting.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I'm still hesitant to go above $950,000 at this time. Perhaps we can find a compromise closer to that figure?  I'm willing to offer $975,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",975000.0,Bob,4,
