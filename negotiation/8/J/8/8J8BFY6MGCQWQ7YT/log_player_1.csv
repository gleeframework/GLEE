"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, aiming to maximize my profit.  I'll see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum value. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm still aiming for a higher price, but I'm willing to come down a bit to see if we can reach a compromise.  $125 is still within my acceptable range, and hopefully, Bob will see that it's a fair price considering his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $105 is getting closer to my minimum and is better than selling to John. It's a good middle ground, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by being too stubborn."
