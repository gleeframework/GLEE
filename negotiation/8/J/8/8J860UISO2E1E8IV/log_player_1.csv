Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** A $13,000 offer leaves space for a counteroffer from Bob that still benefits me. 
* **Flexibility:**  If Bob rejects, I can lower the price slightly in subsequent counteroffers while still ensuring a decent profit. 
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 provides leverage, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too Low:**  $9,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting would result in a huge loss for me.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, it's not completely unreasonable. This means there's still room for negotiation.
* **Leverage with John:** I have a backup buyer in John, so I can afford to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer. How about $11,000? This still gives you a good value, and it's closer to where I need to be."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer, but I'm also showing willingness to negotiate further. 
* **Mid-Point:**  My counteroffer is a midpoint between my original offer ($13,000) and Bob's offer ($9,500). This shows I'm flexible but still value my product.
* **Strong Justification:** I'm not just giving a random number. I'm providing a reason (a ""good value"" for Bob) to help him understand my perspective."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from my budget, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** $10,500 is only $4,500 less than my minimum acceptable price. While it's not ideal, it's a reasonable compromise.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing the negotiation might lead to more back-and-forth and could potentially decrease the final price.
* **Time and Effort:**  Accepting Bob's offer saves time and effort compared to further negotiations.  
* **Potential for Future Deals:**  Even though I'm not getting my full desired price, a successful sale with Bob might open doors for future collaborations."
