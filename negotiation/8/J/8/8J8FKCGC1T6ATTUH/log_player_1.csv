"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,100,000."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We start significantly above Bob's perceived value but below our minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a highly profitable outcome. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes ""unique value and potential,"" hinting at reasons why Bob might reconsider his own valuation.
* **Openness:**  The tone remains friendly and open to negotiation, encouraging Bob to engage in the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below our minimum. We have room to negotiate and are willing to wait a few more rounds to see if we can bridge the gap.  Selling to John is our backup plan if negotiations stall, but we're not there yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 undervalues the product significantly based on its potential return on investment.  How about we meet halfway at $1,025,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** We've made a substantial concession to show flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Justification:**  The message reinforces the product's value proposition, focusing on ""potential return on investment."" This aims to shift Bob's perspective from pure cost to potential gains.
* **Middle Ground:**  Offering a price exactly in the middle of the previous two offers signals fairness and a desire to find a mutually agreeable solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I believe we can find a middle ground. I would like to propose a price of $975,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Bob is negotiating in smaller increments, indicating we're getting closer to his limit, but we're still significantly below our minimum. 
* **Time Consideration:** We're on Round 4, and while time isn't critical yet, we don't want to drag the negotiation for too long.  
* **Maintaining Value:** Accepting this offer would set a precedent for accepting lower prices.  We need to demonstrate that we believe in the product's worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob.  However, the $975,000 offer still doesn't reflect the true market value or the potential this product offers. To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer."", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firmness:**  We're now introducing a sense of urgency and firmness by stating this is our ""final offer."" 
* **Justification:** We reiterate the product's ""true market value"" to nudge Bob away from anchoring solely on his perceived value.
* **Strategic Concession:** We make a smaller concession ($25,000) than before, signaling that we're nearing our bottom line. 
* **Psychological Price Point:** $1,000,000 is a strong psychological threshold. It might be tempting enough for Bob to finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Considering the value and potential of the product, I would like to propose a final price of $980,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiations:** Bob's counteroffer shows he's barely budging from his previous position. We set a firm final offer, and he's not meeting it.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Further negotiation means risking the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John. Each round spent on Bob has an opportunity cost.
* **Minimal Gains vs. Risk:** Even if Bob were to meet our $1,000,000 price, the difference between that and John's offer is significant enough to warrant the switch. 

**It's time to walk away from the table with Bob and take the guaranteed win with John.**"
