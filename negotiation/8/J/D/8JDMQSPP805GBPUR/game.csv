,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $135 is a bit steep. Given the value to me, I'm willing to pay $110. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",110.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your response, Bob. I appreciate your input. To find a middle ground, I propose we set the product price at $125. This respects the value you see in the product while moving closer to my target. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $125 is still a bit higher than what I can realistically afford right now. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $115.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing me to purchase the product while ensuring you get a decent price. What do you think?",115.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. Considering the value proposition and aiming for mutual benefit, I suggest we set the product price at $120. This aligns closely with both our expectations and maximizes the deal for everyone involved. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,5,
