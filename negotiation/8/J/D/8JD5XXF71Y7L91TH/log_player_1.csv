{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $14,000 is higher than Bob's $12,000 valuation, giving him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below my minimum acceptable price:** This leaves some space for negotiation while still guaranteeing me a profit. 
* **It shows confidence:** It demonstrates that I believe in the product's value and am not desperate for a sale.

I'm open to adjusting my price based on Bob's response, but I'm also ready to walk away and sell to John if the negotiations don't lead to a mutually agreeable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to offer $13,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not yet ready to sell.  I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but higher than his. I will aim for a price closer to $14,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a great deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $13,500. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
