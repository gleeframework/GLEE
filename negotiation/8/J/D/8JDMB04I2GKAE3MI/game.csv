"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $1400000 is a fair offer, I need to ensure I receive a price closer to the value I've placed on this product. Let's meet in the middle at $1600000. This is my final offer before I explore other options.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $1600000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1500000, but that's my final offer. If I don't get a good deal here, I'll have to explore other options, including buying from John for $1200000.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
