"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is higher than what John is offering. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $6,500?"",
""product_price"": 6500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($6,500) to give myself room to negotiate upwards.  
* **Aiming for Savings:** My goal is to pay significantly less than Alice's starting price and ideally closer to John's offer of $8,000.
* **Leaving Room:** This counteroffer leaves space for Alice to counter, and I can gradually increase my offer in subsequent rounds if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $7,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my price range, but I'm still aiming to get closer to John's offer of $8,000. I'll reject this offer and propose a counteroffer slightly below John's price to test the waters."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. I'm getting closer to what I can afford. Would you consider $7,800?"", 
""product_price"": 7800
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Testing the Waters:**  I'm offering slightly below John's price ($7,800) to see if Alice is willing to go that low. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer puts me in a strong position. If Alice accepts, I've saved money compared to buying from John. If she rejects it, I can still accept John's offer without having lost much negotiating ground. 
* **Limited Rounds:**  We're getting further into the negotiation, and I need to move towards a decision soon."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to your price, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,800. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $8,200. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is Unlikely to Budge:** Alice has made it clear she won't go below $8,000. She's trying to anchor the price above my alternative.
* **No Significant Gain:** Even if I could negotiate Alice down slightly in further rounds, the potential savings would be minimal and not worth the risk of her walking away.
* **Time is a Factor:** We've used half the rounds, and continuing to negotiate with Alice could result in a stalemate, forcing me to buy from John at the last minute anyway. 

It's time to cut my losses and secure the product at the best guaranteed price."
