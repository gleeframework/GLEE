"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,500 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $9,250?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's still well below what the product is worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250.

Alice is coming down, but we're still above your target price and her product valuation. There's room to negotiate further before considering John's offer."
