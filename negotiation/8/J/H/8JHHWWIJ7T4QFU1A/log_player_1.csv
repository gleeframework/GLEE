{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're asking for more than your minimum of $8,000, giving you room to negotiate.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:**  Bob values the product at $12,000, so he has room to negotiate down.
* **It's fair:** You're offering a price that's potentially beneficial for both of you. 

Let's see if Bob accepts or counters!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is a decent price, it's still below what I'd like to get. I'm going to counteroffer Bob and see if we can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,500 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $9,250?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's still well below what the product is worth to you."", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to find a fair price, Alice.  While $9,250 is closer, I'm aiming for something a little more budget-friendly. Would you consider $8,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get closer to my ideal price, Bob's offer of $8,750 is pretty close.  It's a good deal for both of us, and it's definitely better than selling to John for $8,000.  Let's close the deal!"
