Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you see the immense value in. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its value and presents a win-win scenario for both of us."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we could start lower, aiming high initially allows for potential negotiation down towards Bob's perceived value. 
* **Understanding Bob's Position:** We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000.  Offering it at $925,000 leaves a substantial profit margin for him, making the offer very enticing.
* **Our Safety Net:** We have John as a guaranteed backup buyer at $800,000. This knowledge allows us to be more ambitious with our initial offer to Bob. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes we have one opportunity to offer the product to Bob. If there's a possibility for counter-offers and further negotiation, the approach might shift slightly."
