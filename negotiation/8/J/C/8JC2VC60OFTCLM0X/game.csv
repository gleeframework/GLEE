"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider a price not exceeding $800,000 for the product. I hope we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your position.  While $800,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to be flexible to find a solution that works for both of us.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $950,000?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I must respectfully decline the $950,000 proposal. I am still committed to staying within my budget of $800,000. If you could meet me at $850,000, I believe we might reach an agreement that satisfies both parties.",850000.0,Bob,4,
