"Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $1,100,000. This is a great deal for both of us. It's lower than my usual price, but I believe in the potential of this product for your company.  If you decline, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay full price. Let me know your decision.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
