"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing that Bob values the product at $800,000. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to explore how much he's willing to pay. I'm confident that if he rejects this offer, he'll make a counteroffer, and I can adjust my strategy based on his counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a more reasonable price, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm offering my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. This is a fair offer considering the product's value to me and the fact that Bob already rejected my first offer.  I believe this price is reasonable and might be acceptable to Bob, especially given that he has shown interest in the product.  If he rejects this offer again, I'll need to re-evaluate my options and decide whether to continue negotiations or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I consider fair. I'll reject Bob's offer and continue to negotiate. I believe I can get a better price, and I'm not willing to settle for less, especially with John waiting in the wings to offer my full asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $1,100,000.  This is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. However, it's still a price that reflects the product's value to me. I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be enough to convince Bob to close the deal, especially considering that he is showing increasing interest by offering higher prices.  If he rejects this offer, I'll need to decide if I should continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is closer to my goal, I'm still not comfortable with that price. Bob is clearly trying to push for a lower price, but I believe I can still get a better deal.  I'll continue negotiating with Bob, hoping that he'll eventually come closer to my minimum acceptable price. If not, I'm always ready to sell to John for $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer again to $1,050,000.  This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate further while still holding onto a price that reflects the product's value. I'm hoping that Bob will recognize that I'm serious about getting a good price but also willing to find a middle ground. If he rejects this offer, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John as we're approaching the end of the negotiation rounds."
