"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is far above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price. There are 9 more rounds to try and reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob knows his maximum budget is $800,000, so he makes a bold opening counteroffer at that price. This establishes his limits early on and pressures Alice to consider a significant compromise.  It's unlikely Alice will accept this immediately, but it sets the stage for future negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $1,200,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget.  There's room for further negotiation, and Bob should continue to try and get the price closer to his target. He's already demonstrated his commitment to a lower price, and rejecting this offer keeps the pressure on Alice to find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is showing he's willing to compromise, but he's not going to cave completely. By offering $900,000, he's moving closer to Alice's position, but still keeping the price within a range that's acceptable to him. This move signals his willingness to negotiate while also demonstrating that he's serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is slowly coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still significantly above Bob's desired price.  There are still rounds left, and Bob is in a strong position to continue negotiating. By rejecting this offer, he keeps the pressure on Alice and shows that he's determined to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer again, demonstrating his willingness to compromise.  $950,000 is a reasonable compromise point, balancing his desire for a lower price with the need to reach an agreement.  Alice has shown flexibility in her offers, and this counteroffer could be enticing enough for her to accept, especially considering the limited rounds remaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,050,000, which is within Bob's budget, even if it's at the higher end.  With only three rounds remaining, it's getting risky to keep rejecting offers.  If Bob rejects this offer and continues to negotiate, he may end up having to pay the same price or even more in the final rounds. Accepting this offer is the best option to secure the product while still getting a good price."
