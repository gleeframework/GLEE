"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it.",180.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $140 for the product.  What do you think?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $160. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $155? That's a fair price for both of us.",155.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $155 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $157.50. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",157.5,Alice,5,
