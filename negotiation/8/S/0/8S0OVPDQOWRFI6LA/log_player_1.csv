Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price closer to my minimum acceptable value but leaving room for negotiation. This establishes a strong initial position.
* **Leaving Room:** By offering a price below $1,200,000, I incentivize Bob to negotiate rather than going straight to John.
* **Balancing Act:**  The goal is to maximize profit while also ensuring Bob sees potential value in the deal compared to my alternative offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to acquire this product.  However, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows at this time.  I'm willing to offer $1,050,000. This represents a significant value for both of us, and I believe it's a fair starting point for further negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While I want to find a deal that works for both of us, accepting $1,050,000 would be leaving a substantial amount of money on the table, especially considering I have a guaranteed offer for $1,200,000 from John. I'll counter-offer in an attempt to bridge the gap, but I'm prepared to walk away if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is quite a bit lower than I can accept. To make this work, I'd need to see a price closer to $1,125,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product while still acknowledging your budget considerations."", ""product_price"": 1125000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  My counter-offer splits the difference between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility on my part while still pushing for a higher price point. 
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's inherent value to justify the higher price. 
* **Maintaining Walk-Away Power:**  I'm signaling that I'm willing to walk away if necessary by holding firm above the $1,100,000 midpoint between our initial positions. I know John's offer is a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  However, $1,125,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Enough Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is a reasonable compromise. While it's not the absolute maximum I could get, it's significantly above my minimum and a good return on the product. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Further negotiation might yield a slightly higher price, but the risk of Bob walking away increases. It's likely not worth jeopardizing the deal for a relatively small gain at this point. 
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now allows me to re-invest the capital sooner rather than later.

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is a strategically sound decision, balancing profit maximization with the inherent risks of negotiation."
