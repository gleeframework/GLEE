"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900000 is simply too far below the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer and still represents a good deal for both of us.  Let's find a solution that works for everyone.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $975000 is still quite a bit below the value this product brings. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers, and propose $1012500. This price reflects a fair compromise, allowing me to make a profit while enabling you to secure this valuable product. I hope you'll consider this final offer.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
