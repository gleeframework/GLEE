Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $15000. I think that's a fair price for this product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000.
