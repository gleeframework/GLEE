"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $140. I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $155. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,5,
