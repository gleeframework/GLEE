"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Can you meet me in the middle?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is still too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? It's a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's make this happen.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000, but that's as low as I can go. Can you meet me at $9,250?",9250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're pushing your budget, but $9,250 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $9,750 as a final compromise.  This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's finalize this deal.",9750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $9,750, which is $9,375. Can you consider this price?",9375.0,Bob,8,
