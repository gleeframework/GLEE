"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I have to say that $750,000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $875,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000. This is my final offer. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm glad you're willing to go up to $800,000, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet. I'm willing to meet you at $825,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
