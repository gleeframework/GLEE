,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $900,000 is simply too low. Considering the value of this product to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for everyone.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budgetary constraints.  However, $950,000 simply doesn't reflect the value this product holds for you. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000.  This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's try to reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
