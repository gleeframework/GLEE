"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $12,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 was a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $9,000. If you're not able to come down to that price, I'll have to explore other options.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're firm on your offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $9,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $10,500. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
