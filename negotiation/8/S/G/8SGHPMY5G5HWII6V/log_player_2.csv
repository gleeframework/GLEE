"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $9,500. I believe it will be very valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is better than $10,000, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $9,000?  This would still be a good deal for you and gets me closer to my target price."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Alice's offer of $9,250 is closer to Bob's target price of $8,000 than John's offer of $10,000. 
* It's likely that further negotiation would only yield a small reduction in price, and Bob is better off securing the product for a price within his budget.
* While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee of a better price and the risk of Alice walking away entirely."
