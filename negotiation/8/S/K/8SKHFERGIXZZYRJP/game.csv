"I appreciate the offer, but $15,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it, considering it's worth that much to me.  Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to pay $12,500, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $14,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you place on the product.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to meet me halfway, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000, which is still a good deal for you considering you value it at $12,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I think $13,000 is still a bit low for me. I'll meet you at $13,500, which is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"I see you're willing to meet me halfway, Alice.  Let's split the difference and I'll offer you $13,250.  This is a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?",13250.0,Bob,6,

"I like the way you think, Bob! Splitting the difference is a great idea. However, I was thinking we could meet at $13,750. This way, I can still make a nice profit, and you'll get a great deal on the product. What do you think?",13750.0,Alice,7,
