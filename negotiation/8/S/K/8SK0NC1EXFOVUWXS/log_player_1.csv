Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,150,000. I believe this reflects the significant benefits you'll gain."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with a strong offer. This leaves room for negotiation but also sets a tone that you value the product highly. 
* **Close to Bob's Value:**  Knowing Bob values the product at $1,200,000,  offering it at $1,150,000 leaves room for him to potentially meet you in the middle while still securing you a significant profit.
* **Above John's Offer:** This offer ensures that even if Bob negotiates down, you're still likely to get a better deal than selling to John immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the potential of this product, but I'm looking to invest closer to $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below what you know you can get.  You have room to negotiate further and try to bridge the gap. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is your absolute minimum and should only be considered as a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us.  While I appreciate your counteroffer, the value of this product to someone who can leverage its full potential is significantly higher.  Would you be willing to consider $1,100,000?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** We're moving closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Justify Value:** We're reminding Bob of the potential value he gains, subtly anchoring his perception above his initial counteroffer.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counteroffer splits the difference between Bob's offer and our previous price, leaving room for further negotiation while staying above our guaranteed sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still firm on $1,050,000.  This price is fair, considering the value you place on the product and my budget constraints.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** Bob is holding firm at $1,050,000.  Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome.
* **Profitable Sale:**  $1,050,000 is still a very good deal. It exceeds your minimum acceptable price from John and provides a healthy profit. 
* **Risk Mitigation:**  There's always a risk that Bob will walk away from the negotiation entirely if pushed further. Accepting his offer secures the sale."
