"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value you place on the product.  Let's meet halfway.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. Can you consider $8,500? It's a bit closer to your minimum price, and I'm willing to make a decision today if we can agree on a price.",8500.0,Bob,4,
