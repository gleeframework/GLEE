"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $11,500. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to pay that price, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer is quite low and significantly undervalues the product.  While I want to get the best price, dragging this out too long risks losing him. I'll counter, but I'm also conscious of John's offer. 

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However, $9,500 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to come down a bit to $11,000. I think that's a fair offer considering the benefits it provides."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $11,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob is now matching John's offer. There's no strategic benefit to continuing the negotiation with Bob.
