Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm also offering a friendly message to encourage Bob to consider the offer. If Bob rejects, I'll evaluate his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation or selling to John for the guaranteed $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I would like to propose a price of $13,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,000 is closer to my minimum than my initial offer, it's still below my desired price point. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum.  I'm hoping to get at least $14,000."

This price is a good compromise, and it allows me to make a fair profit while still giving you a good deal.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the need for both fairness and profitability in our transaction. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $13,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable and moves us closer to reaching an agreement.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has remained firm at $13,000. While that's a decent price, it's still below my minimum. I'm not willing to go lower, and I'm confident that John will pay my asking price of $15,000.  It's better to sell to John for a guaranteed profit than risk further negotiation with Bob."
