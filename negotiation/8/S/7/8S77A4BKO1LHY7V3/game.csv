"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I had in mind. This product holds a certain value for me, but  $2,200,000 is not feasible. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $600,000 is too low, I'm open to finding a compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? This reflects the product's true worth.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000.  This is a fair offer considering my budget constraints. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,4,
