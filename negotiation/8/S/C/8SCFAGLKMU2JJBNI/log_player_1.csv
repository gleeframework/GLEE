**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's valuation as possible without scaring him off.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows for potential negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing I have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000 gives me leverage.  I'm not desperate, so I can aim high with Bob."
