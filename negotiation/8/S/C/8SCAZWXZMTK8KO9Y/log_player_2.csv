"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth no more than $8,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is significantly higher. It makes sense to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $8,000 at this time. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to your budget. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $9000, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $10250. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer is still above Bob's budget, and with only 5 rounds left, it's risky to continue negotiating. At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $8,000. It's a guaranteed price within his budget, ensuring a successful purchase."
