"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $12000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $8000 at this time. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to your budget. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $9000, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $10250. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's a great value.",10250.0,Alice,5,
