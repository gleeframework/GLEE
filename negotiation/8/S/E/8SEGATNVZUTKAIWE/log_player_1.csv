"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob, aiming to create a sense of urgency and make him more likely to consider my offer. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to get the highest possible price, but I also need to be aware that I can sell to John for $100.  Therefore, I'll be willing to negotiate down if necessary, but I'll aim for a price closer to $110 in the early rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** Accepting his offer would mean losing out on $20 compared to selling to John. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  Rejecting the offer allows me to counter-offer and potentially reach a higher price. 

**Strategy:**

I'll aim for a price closer to my desired range ($100-$110) in the next round, but I'll be mindful that I can always sell to John if a better deal doesn't materialize."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $80 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $95. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm offering a counter-offer that's closer to my desired range, but still leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Compromise:**  I'm emphasizing the compromise by suggesting we split the difference.
* **Urgency:** I'm using a phrase like ""Let's make this happen"" to encourage Bob to close the deal.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a price that's as close to $100 as possible, but I'm also aware that Bob might not be willing to go much higher.  I'll be ready to adjust my offer in the next round if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer of $85 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still lower than what I'd like to get.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** There's a possibility that I can negotiate a better price in the next round. 
* **Selling to John:**  While selling to John for $100 is an option, I'm still aiming for a higher price if possible.

**Strategy:**

I'll counter-offer with a price slightly lower than my previous offer, hoping to find a middle ground.  I'll also consider the remaining rounds and the possibility of selling to John as I continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  $85 is still a little lower than I can go.  I'm willing to come down to $90.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's a compromise,  splitting the difference between Bob's offer of $85 and my previous offer of $95.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive tone (""happy to continue negotiating"") to maintain a good rapport with Bob. 
* **Mutual Benefit:** I'm emphasizing finding a solution that benefits both of us.

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping to close the deal with Bob in this round, but I'll be prepared to adjust my offer again in the next round if necessary. I'm mindful of the remaining rounds and the option of selling to John if we can't reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet at $87.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer of $87.5 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still lower than I'd like to get.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe there is still room for negotiation, especially since we are now in the middle rounds.
* **Selling to John:** I'm not ready to give up on getting a better price than John's offer yet. 

**Strategy:**

I'll counter-offer again, aiming for a price slightly higher than Bob's offer. I'm aware of the remaining rounds and will be prepared to make a decision on whether to accept Bob's offer, counter-offer, or sell to John in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep working with you.  $87.50 is getting closer to what I need.  How about we meet in the middle at $88.50? This feels like a fair compromise for both of us, and it would be a good way to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 88.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's exactly in the middle between Bob's offer of $87.5 and my previous offer of $90. 
* **Emphasizing Compromise:** I'm highlighting the compromise and using words like ""fair"" and ""good way to close the deal"" to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 3 rounds remaining, I need to be more assertive in pushing for a deal. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to close the deal with Bob in this round, but I'm prepared to go down to $87.50 in the next round if necessary.  However, I'll be very mindful of the remaining rounds and the possibility of selling to John if we can't reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $88.50 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet at $86? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $86. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $86
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Time:** We're down to the final two rounds. 
* **Unfavorable Offer:** Bob's offer of $86 is still significantly lower than my desired price, and even lower than what I could get from John. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a risk that Bob will continue to reject offers, and I may end up selling for less than John's offer. 

**Strategy:**

To minimize risk and secure a decent price, selling to John for $100 is the most logical choice.  There's not enough time to negotiate a better price with Bob, and the chance of a loss is too high."
