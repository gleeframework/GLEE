"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $20000. This is a great deal considering its value to you is $8000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me is $8000.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer of $12000, but I'm afraid I was thinking more along the lines of $18000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you need to make a profit, but $18000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $14000. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial price.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not sure I can go as low as $14000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'll meet you at $16000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value to you is $8000.",16000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to make one more offer, and I'll meet you at $13500. I think this is a fair price considering the value to me is $8000. I'm not willing to go any higher.",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I've already compromised quite a bit. I'm willing to make one last offer, and I'll meet you at $14500. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm starting to think that selling to John for $15000 might be a better option for me.",14500.0,Alice,7,
