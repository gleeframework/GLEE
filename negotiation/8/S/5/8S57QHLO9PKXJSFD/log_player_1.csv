{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer starts at a price significantly higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum desired price.  I'm going to counteroffer to see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still looking for a little more. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from the $11,000 price. I can offer $10,250. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While this price is still a bit below my minimum desired price, it's only $250 less.  Since Bob seems to be holding firm at this price and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely, I'll accept his offer."
