"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I see the value in the product but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. After careful consideration, I must respectfully decline your offer. We believe in the intrinsic value of our product and would like to maintain our position at $950,000. However, I understand that finding a mutually agreeable price is essential. Therefore, I propose a counteroffer of $850,000. This proposal allows us to move closer to your valuation while still ensuring a fair return for our investment.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $850,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your continued engagement, Bob. I understand your perspective and am willing to explore a compromise. Based on our previous discussions, I propose a counteroffer of $825,000. This price reflects a middle ground between our original offers, allowing us to move closer to a mutually satisfactory agreement while still ensuring a reasonable return for our investment.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you finding a middle ground.  To be honest, $825,000 is pushing my budget. I could go up to $775,000, but that's my absolute limit.",775000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your openness to negotiation, Bob. I appreciate your efforts to find a suitable price for both of us. After considering your latest offer, I propose a counteroffer of $800,000. This price is a slight increase from your last proposal, aiming to bridge the gap between our positions while still maintaining a fair return for our investment. I hope this proposal aligns more closely with your budget and allows us to reach a mutually agreeable solution.",800000.0,Alice,7,
