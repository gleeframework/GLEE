{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a [Product Description] that I think you might be interested in.  I'm asking $200 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $200, which is higher than my minimum price of $150. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Product Description:**  I've left a placeholder for a description of the product. Including details about what it is will help Bob decide if he's interested and make him more likely to counteroffer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm framing the message as an invitation to a discussion, not a take-it-or-leave-it offer. This keeps the negotiation open and encourages Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $120 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** Bob is showing interest, and I believe I can get a better price by counteroffering.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If I can't get a better deal with Bob, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest. While $120 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $175. This takes into account your interest and still allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer above minimum:** I'm counteroffering at $175, which is above my minimum acceptable price of $150, but lower than my initial offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Reasoning provided:** I'm explaining the counteroffer by highlighting Bob's interest and my need to make a profit. This can help Bob understand my perspective and encourages further negotiation.
* **Open-ended question:** Ending with an open-ended question encourages Bob to respond and continue the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $175 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $150. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum:** Bob has offered my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **No further gain:** There's no incentive to continue negotiating, as I can't get a better price.
* **Equal to John's offer:**  Selling to Bob at $150 is the same as selling to John, and  I don't have any preference between the two buyers. 

By accepting Bob's offer, I can finalize the sale quickly and avoid the risk of further negotiation potentially ending in a worse outcome."
