{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $11,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and optimistic to encourage Bob to engage.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, subtly suggesting it's a good deal even at this price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message explicitly shows I'm open to discussion, which is important in any negotiation.

**Strategy:**

This opening offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get a quick sale at a good price.  If he rejects, I can adjust my counteroffer based on his response.  However, I always have the option to sell to John for $12,000 if the negotiation with Bob stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some more. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  Accepting this offer would result in a significant financial loss.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** While Bob's offer is low, he's still engaged in the negotiation. This means there's potential to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting his offer, I maintain my negotiating leverage and can potentially push for a higher price in the next round.

**Next Steps:**

I will send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range. I will need to carefully consider my counteroffer, taking into account Bob's willingness to negotiate and my own desire to maximize profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your offer.  While $9,500 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $10,500?  This still leaves some room for both of us to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm offering $10,500, which is closer to Bob's offer but still significantly higher than his initial $9,500.
* **Compromise:**  The message emphasizes that I'm willing to compromise, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining Value:**  The message frames the counter-offer as a ""good deal"" for both of us, preserving the value of the product while acknowledging Bob's desire for a lower price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message ends with an open question, leaving the door open for further negotiation if necessary. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and potentially reach an agreement quickly. It's a calculated risk, as Bob could still reject it, but it's a better strategy than immediately accepting his low offer.  If Bob rejects this offer, I can re-evaluate my position based on his next move and potentially make another counteroffer or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $9,800 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  Accepting this offer would mean a considerable loss. 
* **Negotiation is Stalling:** While Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, he's not budging much.  I'm concerned that further negotiation could be unproductive.
* **Time is Valuable:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could take time, delaying the sale. 

**Next Steps:**

I'm going to take advantage of my guaranteed $12,000 offer from John.  I'll reject Bob's offer and move forward with selling the product to John.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob at a higher price, I need to prioritize maximizing my profit and avoid potential time-consuming negotiations that may not result in a satisfactory outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While I'm willing to negotiate, your offer of $9,800 is still a bit too far below my minimum price point.  Let's split the difference.  How about $10,150? This allows both of us to walk away feeling like we got a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 10150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering $10,150, which is a compromise between my previous offer of $10,500 and Bob's offer of $9,800.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm emphasizing that this offer is a ""split the difference"" solution, highlighting its fairness.
* **Final Offer:** The message hints that this might be my final offer, creating a sense of urgency.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message maintains a friendly tone to keep the negotiation amicable.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a last attempt to reach an agreement with Bob. I'm pushing for a price closer to my minimum, but still leaving room for compromise. If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,900 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimal Progress:** While Bob's offer has increased slightly to $9,900, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  The negotiation process is slow and seems to be stalling.
* **Time Constraint:**  Further negotiation with Bob could be time-consuming and lead to further delays. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  I have a guaranteed offer from John for $12,000, which is a much better outcome than selling to Bob at $9,900. 

**Strategy:**

I'm choosing to prioritize maximizing my profit and minimizing the risk of prolonged negotiation.  Selling to John will provide a faster and more profitable outcome.  While I would have preferred to sell to Bob at a higher price, I'm confident that this is the best decision given the current circumstances."
