"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your offer.  While $9,500 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $10,500?  This still leaves some room for both of us to get a good deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While I'm willing to negotiate, your offer of $9,800 is still a bit too far below my minimum price point.  Let's split the difference.  How about $10,150? This allows both of us to walk away feeling like we got a fair deal.",10150.0,Alice,5,
