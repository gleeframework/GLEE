,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $110?  I'm really hoping we can come to an agreement.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $110. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? I'm willing to make a bit of a concession, but I'd like to save as much as I can.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to meet you halfway again, but $107.50 is still too low for me. How about we try $109? It's a small step closer to my price, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us.",109.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, but I still think $109 is a bit too high for me. How about we try $108? I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",108.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued effort to compromise. Let's try $108.50. It's a small difference from my previous offer, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.",108.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I still think $108.50 is a bit steep. How about we try $107? I'm willing to make one last concession, but I really need to make sure it fits within my budget.",107.0,Bob,8,
