"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is much higher than both your budget and what you can get from John. You should definitely try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it."",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally good negotiation practice to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $60, you are ""anchoring"" the negotiation to a lower price point.  Even if Alice rejects this offer, her counteroffers are likely to be influenced by this lower starting point. 
* **Leaving Room:**  You've left yourself a lot of room to negotiate upwards towards your $80 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $60 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  Could you meet me halfway at $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** $105 is still significantly higher than your $80 budget and what John offers. 
* **Negotiation Progress:** While Alice rejected your initial offer, she moved significantly from $150 to $105. This indicates she's willing to negotiate.
* **Room to Negotiate:**  There's still room to negotiate between $105 and your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial price.  How about we settle at $75? That's a fair offer."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:**  You've increased your offer from $60 to $75, showing Alice you're willing to move closer to her price.
* **Below Budget:** This counteroffer is still comfortably below your $80 maximum, giving you some wiggle room.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By suggesting you ""settle"" at $75, you subtly introduce a sense of urgency, hoping Alice will agree to avoid further negotiation."
