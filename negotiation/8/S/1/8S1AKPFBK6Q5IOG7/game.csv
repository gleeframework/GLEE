"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity that I think you'll find extremely valuable.

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I have to say that I'm not willing to go as low as $550000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $600000. This is a compromise that I believe still reflects the product's value, while also being more reasonable for you. What do you think?",600000.0,Alice,3,
