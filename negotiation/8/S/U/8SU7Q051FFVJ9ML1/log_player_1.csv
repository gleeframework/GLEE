Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Is there any wiggle room on the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $120 is already a very competitive price for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $105?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the effort to meet in the middle, but $105 is still a bit out of my budget. How about we try $92? I'm really interested in the product and I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm still trying to be mindful of my expenses. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll go much higher than $92.  Selling to John for $100 is a guaranteed profit and avoids further negotiation."
