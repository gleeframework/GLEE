"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $9000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $12000. I'm willing to be flexible, but I want to make sure we start with a strong foundation. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,
