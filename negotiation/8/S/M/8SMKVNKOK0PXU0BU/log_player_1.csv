Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is higher than Bob's perceived value of the product, but lower than your guaranteed minimum. This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize your profit:**  You'll earn $1,000 more than your minimum if Bob accepts.
* **Increase the likelihood of a sale:** The offer is attractive enough for Bob to consider, but not so high that he'll automatically reject it.

If Bob rejects, you can confidently move on to John and secure your guaranteed $12,000."
