"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $800,000 is a bit lower than I'm willing to go right now. I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $900,000 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still a bit higher than I'd like to be.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $925,000 for the product.  What do you say?",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll offer the product to you for $920,000. I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. What do you think?",920000.0,Alice,5,
