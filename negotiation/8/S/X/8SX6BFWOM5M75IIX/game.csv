"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  However, the product's value is truly significant, and $15,000 doesn't quite reflect that. How about we meet in the middle at $19,000?",19000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. $17,000 is closer to the mark, but I need to get a bit more for it to make sense for me. Would you be willing to do $18,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",18000.0,Alice,5,
