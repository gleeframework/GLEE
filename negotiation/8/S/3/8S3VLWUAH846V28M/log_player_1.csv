"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go above $1,200,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still significantly below what I'm willing to accept. I'm going to try and negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I need to get closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,500,000 is still a bit out of my reach. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're willing to work with me on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's a step in the right direction, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable here, but I can't go lower than $1,400,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. If you're serious about purchasing it, let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $1,400,000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $1,300,000.  If we can't agree on this, I'm going to have to seriously consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where the negotiations with Bob are becoming unproductive. I'm not willing to go lower than $1,400,000, and Bob seems unwilling to budge from his offer of $1,300,000.  It's time to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $1,500,000. It's a better outcome than settling for a price below what I believe the product is worth."
