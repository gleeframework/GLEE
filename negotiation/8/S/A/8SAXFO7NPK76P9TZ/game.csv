"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me.  Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we compromise at $1,150,000? This price is closer to my initial offer, and it reflects the value I see in the product. Let's work together to find a solution.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
