"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your target price is around $1,200,000, but I still need to make a profit. Considering our previous discussion, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,350,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer you $1,325,000.  This shows a significant move from my last offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's work together to close this deal.",1325000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I still need to make a decent profit. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to reduce the price to $1,325,000 - $25,000, which is $1,300,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
