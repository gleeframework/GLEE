# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is a good starting point, but there's significant room for negotiation.  Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy in this round."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still convinced that the product's value to you is higher than what you're willing to pay. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $900,000. This is a compromise that I believe still reflects the product's true worth, while also being more competitive than my initial offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is better than her previous offer, but still above my target price.  Since there are still rounds left, I'll reject the offer and continue negotiating to try and secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable.  Let's meet in the middle at $850,000.  This price reflects the value to me, while allowing you to make a strong profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's true value to you, I'm willing to compromise further and propose a price of $875,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth, while also being a reasonable compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is very close to my target price.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a good chance I won't get a lower offer from Alice, and I risk running out of rounds.  Accepting this offer allows me to secure the product at a reasonable price, saving a significant amount compared to buying from John."
