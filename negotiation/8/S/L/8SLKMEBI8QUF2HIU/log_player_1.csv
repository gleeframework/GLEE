Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for $1,199,999. I know you'll find it valuable, and this price reflects its unique qualities."",
""product_price"": 1199999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit with Bob:**  The goal is to get as much as possible from Bob before defaulting to John's guaranteed offer. 
* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price just below your guaranteed sale price ($1,200,000) sets a high anchor. While this might seem steep, it leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Strategic Justification:**  Highlighting the product's ""unique qualities"" subtly justifies the high price without revealing your bottom line.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes you have minimal time pressure and John's offer is guaranteed. If you need to sell quickly, a lower initial offer might be wiser.
* Bob's personality and negotiation style are unknown.  Observing his reactions can help you adjust your approach if needed."
