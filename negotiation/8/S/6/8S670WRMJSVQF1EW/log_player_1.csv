Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $15,000 to him, I'll aim to get as close to that value as possible while still making a profit.

Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": $12,000}

I'm willing to sell the product to Bob for $12,000, which is a $3,000 discount from its true value to him. Let's see what he thinks!"
