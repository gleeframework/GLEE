"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
This is a no-brainer. Alice's initial offer is way above your budget and your maximum price from John. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $60 for the product."",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($60) than my maximum budget ($80). This leaves room for negotiation and signals that Alice's initial price is unrealistic for me. 
* **Anchoring:**  By throwing out the $60 figure, I'm trying to anchor the negotiation lower. Even if Alice doesn't agree to this price, it might influence her subsequent offers.
* **John as Leverage:**  I know I have John's offer of $80 as a backup, which gives me leverage in the negotiation. I don't need to reveal this yet, but it allows me to be more comfortable walking away if Alice doesn't budge enough."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your offer, $60 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice moved from her initial offer, $90 is still above both my budget and John's offer. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Her willingness to negotiate suggests there's potential for a lower price.
* **Leverage Remains:** Having John's offer as a backup means I don't need to rush into accepting a price I'm not comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  How about we settle at $70? That's a fair price, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up Incrementally:** I'm increasing my offer to $70, showing Alice I'm willing to negotiate but also holding firm below my maximum.
* **Aiming Slightly Below Target:** My ideal outcome is to get the product for around $75, so this offer positions me well for a final round of bargaining. 
* **Maintaining Pressure:** By staying firm, I'm letting Alice know I'm serious and won't simply cave to her demands. She still has a significant incentive to sell to me rather than lose the sale entirely."
