Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $19,000. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he counter-offers. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing John will buy the product for $15,000 gives Alice leverage. She doesn't have to desperately accept a low offer from Bob.
* **Value Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value, encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** This response assumes we don't know Bob's negotiation style. If we knew he was very price-sensitive, a slightly lower initial offer might be more effective.
* **Market Conditions:** This assumes the product's value is relatively stable. In a volatile market, Alice might adjust her strategy."
