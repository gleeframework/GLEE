"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a reasonable starting point, giving me some room to negotiate down if necessary. I'm confident the product is worth more than $12,000 to me, so I'm aiming for a good profit.  We'll see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $13,500 is a decent price, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point.  I'll see if I can counter with a slightly higher offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm going to counter with $14,000. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, and I think it's a fair price given the product's value. I'm hoping that Bob will accept, but if not, I'm prepared to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a bit more, $13,200 is a good price and it's better than selling to John for $12,000. I'm starting to run out of time, and I don't want to risk getting a lower price or having to deal with further negotiation."
