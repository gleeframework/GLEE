"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm asking for $20,000. I believe this is a fair price considering what you'll gain from it.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $20,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $13,000 is quite a bit below the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $18,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $18,000 is still outside my budget. How about $15,500? This is a reasonable compromise and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price.",15500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $17,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product. What do you say?",17000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $17,000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $15,500. This seems fair, considering the value we both place on the product.",15500.0,Bob,6,
