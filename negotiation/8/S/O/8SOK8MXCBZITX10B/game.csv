"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is a fair price, considering what I'm willing to pay and the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can agree on this.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
