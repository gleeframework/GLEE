"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,300,000. I'm confident this price reflects its worth and opens the door to a mutually beneficial deal.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm still not convinced it's worth $2,300,000 to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000. I believe this price is more reasonable and reflects the value I see in the product.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,400,000 is a significant investment, I believe the true value of this product is still significantly higher.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its worth.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  It seems we're getting closer. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to accept $1,900,000 for the product. I believe this represents a significant concession on my part and a fair deal for both of us.",1900000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,850,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1850000.0,Bob,6,
