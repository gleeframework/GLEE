"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,300,000. I'm confident this price reflects its worth and opens the door to a mutually beneficial deal."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  I'm starting significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This gives room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""incredible value and potential,"" framing the high price as justified rather than arbitrary.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains positive and collaborative, suggesting a willingness to find a price that works for both parties. 

By starting high, I aim to:

1. **Anchor:**  Influence Bob's perception of the product's value.
2. **Gather Information:**  His response will reveal how much he's willing to pay and how quickly he's willing to negotiate.
3. **Maintain Leverage:**  I always have the option to move down, but starting high gives me more room to maneuver."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm still not convinced it's worth $2,300,000 to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000. I believe this price is more reasonable and reflects the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is above my minimum, I believe I can still negotiate a better price. I'm willing to engage in a few more rounds to see if I can close the gap. Bob meeting me ""halfway"" after only one round suggests there's more room for him to move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,400,000 is a significant investment, I believe the true value of this product is still significantly higher.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its worth."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a substantial decrease from my initial offer ($300,000), signaling flexibility and a desire to reach a deal. 
* **Holding Firm (for now):**  I'm not yet willing to go below $2,000,000. I want to see if Bob is willing to make a more significant jump towards my range.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the ""fair compromise"" and continues to highlight the product's value. 
 
This counteroffer aims to:

* **Encourage Movement:**  A significant price drop on my end may prompt Bob to make a more substantial offer next round.
* **Maintain a Strong Position:** I'm still well above my minimum, preserving negotiating power.
* **Test Bob's Resolve:**  This round will reveal how committed Bob is to acquiring the product and how much further he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently meeting me halfway, which indicates he's willing to negotiate but is also trying to anchor the price around his desired range.  While $1,800,000 is getting closer to acceptable, I still believe I can push for a better deal, especially with 6 rounds remaining. I'm not yet ready to concede the extra $300,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  It seems we're getting closer. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to accept $1,900,000 for the product. I believe this represents a significant concession on my part and a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** I'm reducing my offer by a smaller amount ($100,000) this time. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also signals that I'm reaching the limit of my flexibility.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By framing it as a final offer, I aim to encourage Bob to make a decision quickly.
* **Above Minimum, Favorable Deal:** The offer is still comfortably above my minimum acceptable price and represents a significant profit for me.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Apply Pressure:**  The smaller concession and ""final offer"" framing are designed to nudge Bob towards accepting.
* **Maintain Profitability:** I'm still securing a very favorable price point.
* **Avoid Stalemate:** I want to avoid getting stuck in a back-and-forth loop with diminishing returns."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,850,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Target:**  $1,850,000 is only $50,000 away from my last offer, and significantly higher than Bob's initial offers. Continuing to push for a small increase risks alienating Bob and potentially losing the sale altogether. 
* **Time Value of Money:** While I could potentially squeeze out a bit more, each round represents a delay in finalizing the sale. Closing the deal now means I can re-invest or utilize those funds sooner. 
* **Strong Position:** I've negotiated from a strong position throughout, and Bob has steadily increased his offer. Accepting now secures a favorable outcome. 

Overall, accepting $1,850,000 represents a substantial profit and a successful negotiation."
