"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product. I believe it's worth a significant investment, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I agree the product has value, I'm looking to invest closer to $1,000,000. Would you consider a price in that range?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to invest closer to $1,000,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $1,350,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair considering the product's value to you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $1,125,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a compromise, but $1,125,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'll counter with $1,250,000. This is my final offer within this range, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
