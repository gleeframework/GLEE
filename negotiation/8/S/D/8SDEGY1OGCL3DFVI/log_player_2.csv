{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is far too expensive at $15,000.  It's worth rejecting the offer and trying to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

I'm offering Alice my maximum price of $8,000. This is my absolute limit, and I'm willing to walk away if she won't accept."

$12,000 is still too high.  It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $9,500. It's still significantly lower than Alice's last offer and closer to my maximum, but it shows I'm willing to compromise."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice is not budging on her price, and the negotiation is becoming unproductive. I've already offered a fair price, and I don't want to risk wasting more time. It's time to move on and purchase the product from John for $8,000."
