"Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $115 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  Let's try $110 - it's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal.",110.0,Bob,6,

"Alice,  I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $112.50 is still a little high for me.  Let's split the difference again at $111.25. It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm ready to close.",111.25,Bob,8,
