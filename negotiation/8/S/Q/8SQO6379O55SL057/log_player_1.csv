"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting high, at $18,000, knowing Bob values the product at $10,000. This sets the stage for negotiation and gives me room to compromise.  I'm confident I can get a price closer to my minimum of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm aiming for.  I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm dropping my price to $16,000, meeting Bob halfway from my initial offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise, hopefully making him more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,500 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to try for one more counteroffer before considering selling to John. I think I can get Bob to budge a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm dropping my price to $14,500. This is getting close to my minimum, but I'm still hoping Bob will come up a bit more.  I'm willing to take a small loss at this point, but I want to see if I can avoid selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where Bob's counteroffers are consistently below my minimum. It's getting risky to keep negotiating with Bob, as I'm running out of rounds. To ensure I get at least my minimum, I'm going to sell to John for $15,000."
