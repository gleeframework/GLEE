"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum.  This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly opening helps build rapport.
* **Justification:** Mentioning Bob's perceived value provides a reason for the price. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This offer is designed to encourage Bob to counteroffer, allowing us to find a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to my budget. How about $10500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While it's closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin.
* **Opportunity for further negotiation:** I can still potentially get closer to my desired price by rejecting and making a counteroffer.
* **Selling to John is not ideal:**  While selling to John guarantees a higher price, it's important to explore all options and potentially get closer to my desired price with Bob. 

**Next Round Strategy:**

I will counter with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, perhaps $11,000, to encourage further negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $11,000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, while also being closer to your offer. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing a willingness to negotiate by lowering my price slightly.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** I emphasize finding a solution that works for both of us.
* **Reasonable profit:** I still maintain a profit margin with this offer.
* **Encouragement:**  This message is positive and encourages Bob to continue negotiating."
