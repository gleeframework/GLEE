Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($150) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still ensuring you make a significant profit.
* **Avoid Alienating Bob:** Offering it for a price too close to $150 might make Bob feel like you're trying to take advantage of his high valuation. A slightly lower price can make the deal feel fairer and encourage him to accept. 
 
This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while acknowledging the guaranteed sale to John as a backup option."
