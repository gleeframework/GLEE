"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to acquire this truly unique product.  Its value is undeniable.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I believe this is reflective of its worth, however, I'm always open to discussing terms.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the opportunity to discuss the price of the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to offer it for $1,300,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $1,300,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $1,150,000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,225,000. This offer reflects the product's inherent value while acknowledging your desire for a fair deal. What do you say?",1225000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,100,000, which is a significant discount from your previous offer. I'm hoping we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
