Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $120 as possible since that's what John will pay. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While $119 is my initial offer, starting slightly lower might encourage Bob to counter-offer, potentially landing somewhere above his $100 valuation.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  Asking for the full $120 might discourage Bob. A slightly lower price makes the offer seem more appealing. 

This strategy aims to balance getting the highest possible price from Bob while still making the deal attractive enough for him to accept."
