"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. How about $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I think that's a fair price for the product's value.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $100, which is the price I could get it for elsewhere. Let me know if you're willing to accept that.",100.0,Bob,4,
