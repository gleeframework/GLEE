"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal considering its value to you.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is a decent price, it's still higher than what the product is worth to Bob. Bob can try to negotiate a lower price.  There's a chance Alice might accept a counteroffer closer to Bob's preferred price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested but $115 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $105 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $105 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. That's still a great price for you, considering the value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $110, which is still within Bob's budget and closer to his preferred price. While there's always the chance to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might reject another counteroffer and Bob might end up paying the $120 to John.  Accepting $110 is a good compromise and saves Bob $10 compared to buying from John."
