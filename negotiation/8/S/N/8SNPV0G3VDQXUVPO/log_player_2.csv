"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find incredibly valuable, for $14,500.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is $14,500, which is less than your maximum budget of $15,000. While you could potentially get it for slightly cheaper from John ($15,000), there's no guarantee that John won't raise his price later. It's generally good practice to accept a fair offer when it's within your budget."
