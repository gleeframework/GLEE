Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll really value. I'm asking for $100 for it, which is a fair price considering its worth to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price of $100, which is still lower than the product's worth to Bob but leaves me a decent profit. 
* **Framing the offer:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob to make him more likely to accept. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm not going for the full $120 right away, leaving room for Bob to counter-offer and for us to reach a mutually beneficial price. 
* **The ""John"" option:** This is my safety net. If Bob rejects my offer and we can't reach an agreement, I can always sell to John for $80. This gives me the confidence to negotiate a bit more aggressively."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but I'm only willing to pay $90 for it right now.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$90 is still profitable:**  While $90 is less than my initial offer, it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $80.  
* **Room for improvement:**  I believe I can get closer to my target of $100.  Bob has shown interest, so there's room to negotiate.
* **Negotiation is key:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can send a counteroffer and potentially increase the price further. 
* **The ""John"" option is still available:** If negotiations with Bob stall, I can always sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you're interested in the product. I'm willing to go down to $95, which is still a fair price considering its value. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating flexibility.  
* **Maintaining a profit margin:**  $95 is still above my minimum price and leaves a decent profit margin. 
* **Positive language:** I'm using encouraging language to keep the negotiation positive and avoid a stalemate. 
* **""Fair price"" emphasis:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the value he'll gain from the product. 
* **Closing the deal:** I'm using language that suggests a willingness to finalize the deal, subtly pressuring Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, I'm still only willing to go as high as $92.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'd like to close the deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my target:**  $92 is very close to my initial target of $100. 
* **Minimizing risk:** While I could try to negotiate further, there's a chance Bob might walk away completely.  Accepting his offer guarantees a sale and a good profit. 
* **The ""John"" option:**  While I could sell to John for $80, the $12 extra from Bob is significant, especially considering I'm close to my target.
* **Fair price:** Bob is highlighting that $92 is a fair price for both of us. This suggests a willingness to compromise.

**Overall, the potential gains from further negotiation are outweighed by the risk of losing the sale entirely.**"
