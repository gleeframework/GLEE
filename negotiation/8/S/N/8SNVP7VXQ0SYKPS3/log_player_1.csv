Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000.  This is a strong opening position, and gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary. I'm confident the product is worth more than $800,000 to me, so I'm not starting at that price. I'll be watching Bob's response closely to see if he's interested in negotiating further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm not certain of the value of the product to him, I'm confident it's worth more than $750,000 to me. I'm going to reject his offer and see if we can find a more mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum value of $800,000. It also shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground.  I'll be watching to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum value.  While I'd like to get more, I'm confident that further negotiation might not be fruitful.  I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product."
