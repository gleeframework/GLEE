Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in.  I'm offering it to you for $200. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$200** is a starting point that's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* This allows for some room to negotiate downwards if Bob makes a counteroffer.
* The message is friendly and inviting, aiming to build a positive rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $120 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to sell for that low. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $170? Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 170} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **$170** is a counteroffer that's still higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150, but it shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* The message maintains a friendly and positive tone while also clearly stating my position. 
* This offer aims to find a compromise and potentially close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $170 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $145. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $145 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not comfortable selling for that low, especially after several rounds of negotiation.  Selling to John for $150 is a safe and guaranteed option that meets my minimum requirement.  I'm willing to take the slightly lower profit to avoid further negotiations that might not lead to a better outcome."
