"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the chance to acquire [product name] for a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this is a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting a valuable asset at a price below its worth to you. However, I want to be upfront â€“ I have another interested buyer, John, who is willing to pay $1,500,000. This means time is of the essence. Please let me know your decision as soon as possible. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
