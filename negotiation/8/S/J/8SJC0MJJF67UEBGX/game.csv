"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is truly exceptional and worth a significant investment. I'm confident it will generate substantial value for you. My initial offer is $2000000. Let's discuss and see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2000000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $1000000 at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1000000 is unfortunately too low for me. This product holds substantial value, and I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $1750000? I believe this price reflects the product's potential and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1750000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit out of my range. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $1375000. This would be a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this transaction.",1375000.0,Bob,4,
