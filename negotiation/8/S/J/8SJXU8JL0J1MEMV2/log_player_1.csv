Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm asking for $15,000. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. 
* **Strategic Starting Point:** Offering the product at $15,000 gives room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit. 
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:**  Bob's response will reveal how much he values the product and if he's willing to negotiate. 
 
**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  I'm prepared to negotiate with Bob based on his response.  My ultimate goal is to get the highest price possible, knowing I have a fallback option with John."
