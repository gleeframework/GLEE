Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $11,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as much money as possible from Bob before resorting to John's guaranteed offer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some room for Bob to negotiate (if he wants) while still securing a significant profit for me.
* **Above Bob's Value:**  The offered price is higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000), but not so high that it's instantly off-putting.  It creates a scenario where Bob might see the deal as worthwhile if he values the product even slightly more than $10,000."
