"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to someone with your expertise, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.  What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm confident this product has great value, but I'm currently looking at a price closer to $950,000.  I'm open to further discussion, let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is a tempting offer, I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $1,025,000?  This reflects the product's potential and ensures a fair deal for both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,025,000 is still a bit more than I'm aiming for.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000, reflecting the value I see in the product while also allowing for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find a compromise that works.",975000.0,Bob,4,
