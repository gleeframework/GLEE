"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $7,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. I should make a counteroffer below $7,000 to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! This product looks great, but I'm working with a slightly tighter budget. Would you consider $5,500?"",
 ""product_price"": 5500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $5,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $6,500. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming closer to my desired price range, but I still believe there's room for negotiation. I will reject this offer and propose a price closer to $6,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle at $6,000? That would be a comfortable price for me."",
 ""product_price"": 6000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $6,000 is a good price for you, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $6,800. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $6,800. Accepting this offer gets me the product at a significant discount compared to John's price while avoiding the risk of the negotiation failing."
