"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth much more to me than that. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This is a common strategy to maximize my potential profit. 
* **Focusing on value:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product to me, implying that I'm making a sacrifice by offering it at this price. This could make Bob more likely to consider my offer. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This offer allows for several rounds of negotiation if Bob rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below what the product is worth to me. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $9,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to get for this product.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer strategy:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer, but I'm also showing flexibility by making a counter-offer. 
* **Reasoning:**  I'm providing a clear justification for my counter-offer, highlighting the value of the product and showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Middle ground:**  I'm aiming for a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer,  which could increase the chances of reaching an agreement."

# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has increased his offer, it's still not close to my minimum. I am determined to get a better price.  Selling to John for $15,000 is a tempting option, but I'm going to try one more counteroffer with Bob to see if I can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate. While $9,800 is closer to what I need, I'm still not able to go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $10,200, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can finalize this deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10200}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Maintaining the negotiation:** I'm continuing to negotiate with Bob, hoping to reach a deal before resorting to selling to John.
* **Slight concession:**  I'm making a small concession by lowering my price, showing a willingness to compromise while still holding onto a fair price. 
* **Finality:** I'm subtly suggesting that this is my final offer, creating a sense of urgency."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I still need to save some money. I'm willing to pay $9,900 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and Bob's offer, while slightly higher than his previous ones, is still below my minimum. With only four rounds left, I'm not confident I can get a significantly better price from Bob.  Therefore, it's in my best interest to sell to John for $15,000 to ensure I secure the best possible deal."
