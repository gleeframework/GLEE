While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above my target price of saving as much money as possible.  I'll try to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

# Alice's message: Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I understand that you're still looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to make another concession.

Alice has come down to $1,100,000, which is very close to my ideal price of $1,050,000.  While I could continue negotiating, I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  Accepting this offer is a good compromise that saves me a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
