"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a very competitive price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a discounted rate. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get the product for closer to $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to get the product for a lower price, but I'm still willing to make a compromise. After re-evaluating the market value of the product, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a significant discount from the original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $1,150,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to land at $1,050,000.  This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I understand that you're still looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go below $1,100,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
