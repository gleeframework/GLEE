"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Starting Point:**  Starting high anchors the negotiation. Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, it sets a tone that the product is highly valued. 
* **Room to Negotiate:**  The $900,000 markup allows significant room for negotiation over the 10 rounds while still aiming for a final price significantly above Alice's minimum.
* **Alternative Option:** The presence of John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 gives Alice leverage. She doesn't *need* to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $700,000. This represents a fair price considering the potential risks and future market fluctuations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both the product's value to Alice and the price she opened with. Accepting would mean a substantial loss compared to selling to John. While there's still time to negotiate, accepting this lowball offer would send the wrong signal about Alice's willingness to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but your offer is considerably lower than the product's true value. I'm willing to move down to $1,600,000 to find a mutually beneficial agreement. This price reflects the uniqueness of what I'm offering."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Measured Concession:** Alice makes a $300,000 concession from her initial offer, demonstrating willingness to negotiate but not desperation.
* **Reiterating Value:** The message emphasizes the product's unique value to justify the high price. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer still leaves room for Alice to negotiate down over the remaining rounds while staying well above her $1,000,000 minimum and John's guaranteed offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position on the product's value, but we need to find a middle ground. I'm willing to increase my offer to $850,000.  I believe this demonstrates my commitment to making this deal work while being mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob increased his offer, but it's still substantially below Alice's minimum and John's offer.  

* **Negotiating Tactics:** Bob's language about ""budget"" is likely a tactic to create a sense of limitation that may not be entirely true.
* **Holding Firm:** Alice needs to show Bob that she's serious about the product's value. Accepting this offer would signal weakness.  
* **John as Leverage:** Alice's ability to sell to John for $1,000,000 gives her a strong fallback position and the ability to be more patient in these negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about acquiring this product, and I appreciate that. However, the gap between our positions is still substantial.  To be frank, I'm prepared to walk away and accept another offer if we can't find common ground soon.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, but that's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Time Tactic:**  Alice introduces a sense of urgency by implying a competing offer (John) and stating this is her final offer, aiming to push Bob towards a quicker decision. 
* **Significant Drop, But Above Minimum:** The $200,000 drop is substantial, showing flexibility, but the price remains well above Alice's $1,000,000 floor and John's standing offer.
* **Testing Bob's Resolve:** This strong stance will reveal if Bob is genuinely interested at a higher price point or if he's only willing to play in the lower range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your honesty and your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,400,000 is still beyond my budget.  To show you I'm serious, I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute maximum I can spend. If we can't agree on this, I'll need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Met the Minimum:** Bob's offer now matches Alice's minimum acceptable price and John's guaranteed offer.
* **Finality:** Both parties have signaled this is their final offer, making further negotiation unlikely to yield a better outcome for Alice.
* **""Bird in Hand"" Principle:**  It's generally wise to accept a good offer on the table rather than risking the loss of the deal entirely by pushing for more."
