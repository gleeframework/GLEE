"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $700,000. This represents a fair price considering the potential risks and future market fluctuations.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but your offer is considerably lower than the product's true value. I'm willing to move down to $1,600,000 to find a mutually beneficial agreement. This price reflects the uniqueness of what I'm offering.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position on the product's value, but we need to find a middle ground. I'm willing to increase my offer to $850,000.  I believe this demonstrates my commitment to making this deal work while being mindful of my budget.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about acquiring this product, and I appreciate that. However, the gap between our positions is still substantial.  To be frank, I'm prepared to walk away and accept another offer if we can't find common ground soon.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, but that's my final offer.",1400000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your honesty and your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,400,000 is still beyond my budget.  To show you I'm serious, I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute maximum I can spend. If we can't agree on this, I'll need to explore other options.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
