Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob before going to John (who guarantees $120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the product is worth $100 to Bob, offering it slightly below your minimum ($120) leaves room for him to counter-offer.  
* **Time Sensitivity:** Adding a ""limited time"" element might encourage Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $119. He might counter-offer, or reject it outright. If he rejects it, you have the safety net of selling to John for your minimum acceptable price."
