"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a special price of $110. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Let's see if we can negotiate a better price from Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90?"", 
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

This counteroffer aims to bring the price closer to Alice's value while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob! I can do $105, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and this price is within your acceptable range. It's better to secure the deal now rather than risk losing it."
