**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:**  Alice's offer of $950,000 is significantly lower than John's price of $1,200,000. 
* **You can still make a profit:** Even at $950,000, you are buying the product for less than its value to you ($1,200,000).  This means you're making a profit on the transaction.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best decision to save money."
