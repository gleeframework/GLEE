# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial deal. However, considering the product's value to you is $15,000, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'll offer it to you for $10,500. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

Alice is firm on her price and coming down in smaller increments.  While I could try to negotiate further,  $10,500 is a reasonable price and it's not worth the risk of her walking away for a potential savings of $500."
