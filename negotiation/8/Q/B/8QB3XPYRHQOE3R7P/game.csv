"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, I'm working with a tighter budget at the moment.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still willing to work with you. Considering the product's value to you is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the original price I was willing to accept was $12,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  While $11,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'd like to propose $10,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, I believe.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial deal. However, considering the product's value to you is $15,000, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'll offer it to you for $10,500. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
