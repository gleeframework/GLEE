"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $9,000. I hope we can come to an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This would still be a great deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's see if we can make this work.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I am still unable to meet you halfway at $11,000. I am willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see that you're serious about getting this product. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair compromise, and it gives you a significant return on your investment. Let's close this deal.",10500.0,Alice,5,
