"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $12,000 is still too high. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:**  It's good to start with a low offer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.
* **$10,500 is reasonable:** This offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still above her minimum value of $10,000.
* **Leaves room for compromise:** This offer allows for some room to negotiate upwards if Alice is hesitant."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** Even though she lowered the price slightly, it's still above the price Bob is willing to pay. 
* **There's room to negotiate further.** Bob has several rounds left, and Alice has already shown a willingness to negotiate. It's likely he can get a better price if he continues to counteroffer.
* **Buying from John is still an option.** If the negotiation with Alice continues to stall, Bob can always choose to buy from John, but it's still more advantageous to try and get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slightly increased offer:** Bob is showing that he's willing to compromise, but not by much. This increase from $10,500 demonstrates a genuine effort to meet Alice halfway.
* **Still below Alice's offer:** This price is still significantly lower than Alice's latest offer of $12,500, leaving room for further negotiation if Alice is willing to come down.
* **Balancing risk and reward:** While the risk of Alice rejecting this offer exists, it's a calculated gamble. Bob is trying to secure a good price without jeopardizing the entire negotiation."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's ideal price.**  While it's getting closer, Bob is aiming for a price closer to $11,000. 
* **More rounds to negotiate.**  With five rounds remaining, there is still time to try and get a better price.
* **Buying from John is still an option.** If the negotiation fails, Bob can always go with John, but it's still worth trying to reach a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increasing the offer:** Bob needs to show Alice he's serious about a deal.  $11,500 is a significant increase from his previous offer, demonstrating his willingness to meet halfway.
* **Still below Alice's offer:**  This price remains below Alice's latest offer of $13,000, leaving space for further negotiation if Alice is willing to come down.
* **Time is running out:**  With only four rounds remaining, Bob needs to make a substantial move.  This offer could be the turning point to get a deal done."

* **Buying from John is still a fallback option.**  If Bob can't get a lower price from Alice, he can always buy from John.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Increase:** Bob is showing Alice he's willing to pay more, but still within his budget. This increase from $11,500 demonstrates his seriousness about securing a deal.
* **Close to Alice's Offer:**  This price is only $1,500 below Alice's latest offer, which is a sign that Bob is willing to compromise. 
* **Two Rounds Remaining:**  With only two rounds left, the pressure is on for both parties to reach an agreement. 
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:**  This offer balances the risk of Alice rejecting it with the potential reward of a successful negotiation. If Alice rejects, Bob can consider buying from John."
