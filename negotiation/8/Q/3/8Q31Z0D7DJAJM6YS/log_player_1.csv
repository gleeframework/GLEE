Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm willing to part with it for $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 950000 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, your goal is to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **High but Reasonable:** Offering it at $950,000 is a high price, but it leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down while still netting you a significant profit.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning a ""limited-time offer"" and that you'll go to another buyer might encourage Bob to act quickly. 
* **Value Highlighting:** While not stating a specific value to Bob, the message hints that the product is worth a lot (""significant value"")  which might make him more amenable to a higher price."
