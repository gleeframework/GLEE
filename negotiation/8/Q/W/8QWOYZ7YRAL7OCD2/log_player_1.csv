Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Round 6
Bob's offer:

``` 

This is a good point to accept the offer.  Here's why:

* **Profitable:** $1,050,000 is a significant profit over your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Strong Negotiation:** Bob has consistently increased his offer, indicating serious interest.
* **Time Value:**  Dragging negotiations out longer risks losing the deal entirely. You're already past the halfway point of your rounds. 

While you could push for a higher price, the risk of losing the deal to Bob and potentially needing to accept John's offer (which is only slightly higher) makes accepting $1,050,000 the most logical choice."
