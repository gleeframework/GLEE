"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $120. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $120 is a better price than John's $150, you can still do better.  You are willing to pay up to $150, and Alice's offer is above your target. It's worth seeing if you can get a lower price by rejecting the offer and potentially negotiating with Alice further."
