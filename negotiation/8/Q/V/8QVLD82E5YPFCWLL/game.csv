"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $12,500 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. I'm willing to come down a bit to $12,800. Let's meet in the middle on this one.  ",12800.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $12,800 is still a little too high for my budget. How about we settle on $12,600?  It's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal.",12600.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $12,600 is still a bit below my minimum. Let's try $12,700. It's a small step towards a deal and closer to your offer. What do you think? ",12700.0,Alice,5,
