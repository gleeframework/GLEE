{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it offers. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. This allows for negotiation while still giving me a good chance to earn a significant amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in it.  Let me know if you're interested in this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,050,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my goal of maximizing profit.  I'm confident I can get a better deal with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000, which is a fair compromise.  It's a great price considering the value of the product, and it allows us both to walk away happy.  Let me know if you're interested in this offer."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
