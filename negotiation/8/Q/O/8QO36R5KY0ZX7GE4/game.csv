"Bob, I have a unique product I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm asking $1750000 for it, which is a fair price considering its potential. I understand this is a significant investment, but I'm confident it will be worthwhile.  If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up at $1500000, so I'm not desperate to sell. Let me know what you think!",1750000.0,Alice,1,
