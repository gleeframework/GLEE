"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm asking $1750000 for it, which is a fair price considering its potential. I understand this is a significant investment, but I'm confident it will be worthwhile.  If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up at $1500000, so I'm not desperate to sell. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Alice's offer is too high.  You can get the same product from John for $1,000,000, which is significantly lower.  It's worth rejecting Alice's offer and going with John."
