Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $11,000 is closer to my goal, I'm still hoping to get it for $10,500.  It's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to give you a small discount, but I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,750. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You should reject Alice's offer. While it's tempting to accept because it's closer to your target price, you're still within your negotiation rounds and you have the chance to get an even better deal.  Keep pushing for a lower price. You're already making progress."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're still hoping to get the product for $10,500, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll offer it to you for $10,700. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You should accept Alice's offer. You've successfully negotiated the price down from $11,500 to $10,700.  You're within a reasonable range of your target price, and there's a good chance that continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better price.  It's worth considering that you only have three rounds left and buying from John would be more expensive."
