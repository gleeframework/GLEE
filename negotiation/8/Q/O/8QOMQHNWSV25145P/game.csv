"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $10,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  $15,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Could you do $11,500?  That would be a fair compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,
