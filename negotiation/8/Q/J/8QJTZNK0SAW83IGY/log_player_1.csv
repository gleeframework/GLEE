Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're aiming for a price closer to $16,000, but I'm still not comfortable with $15,500. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at this price?

Explanation: 

Bob seems firmly set at $14,000 and is unlikely to move significantly higher. While I could continue negotiating, it's risky. It's better to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John than risk Bob walking away and ending up with nothing."
