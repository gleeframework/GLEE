It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice and buy from John. Here's why:

* **Alice is unlikely to budge:** She's declared $850,000 as her ""final offer.""  She's shown a willingness to negotiate down, but her pace is slow.
* **Limited room for negotiation:** Even if you could get Alice to move a bit further, it's unlikely she'd go below $825,000, which is your current best offer. 
* **John offers a guaranteed price:** You know John will sell you the product for $800,000. This saves you money and avoids the risk of a failed negotiation with Alice.

While there's a slight chance of getting the product for a bit less than $850,000 from Alice, the risk isn't worth it. John's offer provides a sure thing at a good price."
