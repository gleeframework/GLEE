"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $160. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 160}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum acceptable price ($150) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm being friendly and encouraging to build rapport.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product without revealing my true minimum. 

This approach gives me a good starting point and allows for potential counteroffers from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $140 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** I believe there's still potential for Bob to offer a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting his offer, I maintain leverage in the negotiation. 

I'll proceed to the next round with a counteroffer to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $155?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 155}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. This shows willingness to compromise.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm still emphasizing the value of the product to justify the price. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the communication friendly and encouraging a deal. 

By offering $155, I'm trying to find a middle ground and see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'd like to propose $145 as the price for the product. This would allow me to stay within my budget while still getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $145 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, there's still room for him to increase his offer closer to my desired price. 
* **Maintain Leverage:** By rejecting this offer, I maintain leverage and demonstrate that I'm not desperate to sell. 

I'll proceed to the next round with a counteroffer to explore if we can bridge the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence!  $145 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to drop to $150, which is my absolute minimum. Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm presenting my final offer, which is my absolute minimum price.  
* **Emphasis on Minimum:**  I clearly state that $150 is my absolute minimum to signal my seriousness and deter further lowball offers. 
* **Positive But Firm:** I remain positive but firm in my message,  acknowledging Bob's efforts while reinforcing my stance. 

By offering $150, I'm hoping Bob will realize the value of the product and accept the deal, but I'm prepared to walk away if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offers, Alice. I really value your product, but I'm still aiming to keep my expenses within my budget. Could we possibly agree on $140 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Repeated Lowball:** Bob has persistently offered prices below my minimum acceptable price. This suggests he may not be willing to meet my price expectations.
* **Time is Running Out:** We're halfway through the negotiation rounds, and there's a risk of further delays with no guarantee of a favorable outcome.
* **John's Offer is Secure:** John is willing to buy the product at my minimum acceptable price of $150. This is a safe and reliable option. 

Considering the limited time and Bob's unwillingness to increase his offer, selling to John is the most rational decision. It guarantees me my minimum desired profit without further negotiation."
