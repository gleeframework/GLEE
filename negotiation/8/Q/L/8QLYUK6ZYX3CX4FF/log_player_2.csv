"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is less than what John is charging, Bob can likely negotiate a better price with Alice.  Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to start the negotiation process and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'd be willing to pay $10,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting the negotiation by offering a price that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above Alice's minimum price.  This shows good faith while also creating room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $11000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $11,000, which is closer to Bob's preferred price of $10,500.  While further negotiation is possible, accepting this offer is the most logical choice. It ensures Bob gets the product at a price significantly lower than John's offer and avoids the risk of Alice further increasing her price or rejecting additional counteroffers."
