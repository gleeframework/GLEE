"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $14,000, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good deal compared to the product's worth to Alice, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. It's worth exploring negotiation to see if a better price can be achieved."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $14,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still holding out for a bit more.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,250? That would be a good compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $13,250 is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his $12,000 limit.  There's still room for negotiation, and it's worth seeing if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,250 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $12,750, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value you place on the product. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 12750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a good price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. Let's seal the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still offering a price above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. While it's tempting to keep negotiating, there's a risk that the price won't come down further or that Bob will run out of rounds.  It's more prudent for Bob to take the guaranteed price from John and secure the product within his budget."
