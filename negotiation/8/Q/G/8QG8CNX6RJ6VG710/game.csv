"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a significant $800,000 to you, and I'm confident it will deliver exceptional value. To start our negotiation, I'm proposing a price of $900,000. This reflects the product's inherent worth and allows for a fair margin. Let's discuss this further.",900000.0,Alice,1,
