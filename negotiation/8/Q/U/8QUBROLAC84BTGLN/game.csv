"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we settle at $900,000? I believe that's a fair offer.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to save some money, Bob, but $900,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we discuss a price of $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I can tell you're serious about selling this product, and I want to work something out.  My final offer is $950,000. Take it or leave it.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm afraid $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I've already made several concessions, and I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one last offer, but I need to get at least $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need $1,025,000. That's my final offer.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
