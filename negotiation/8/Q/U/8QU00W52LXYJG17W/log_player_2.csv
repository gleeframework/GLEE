``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since the product is worth $15,000 to him, he is willing to pay that much, but he'd prefer to pay less. Alice's offer is at his maximum price, so he should reject it. He can then buy the product from John for the same price, fulfilling his goal of getting the product."
