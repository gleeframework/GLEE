Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's significantly above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. It allows for a potential win-win scenario, as Bob still gets a good deal while I get a better price than what John is offering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000}
```

This counteroffer is a slight compromise from my initial offer, but it's still a decent price for me. I believe this will encourage Bob to continue the negotiation and potentially lead to a final agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my desired price with each round, Bob's offer is still too low. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.  I'm confident I can get a better price, but if it doesn't happen, I'm prepared to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but it's still a price that's more profitable than selling to John. I believe this might be the final price Bob is willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still not where I want it to be.  I'm not willing to go lower and risk getting stuck with a suboptimal deal.  Selling to John ensures I get my desired price and avoids further negotiation."
