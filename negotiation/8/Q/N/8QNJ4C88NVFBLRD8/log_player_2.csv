Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}

It signals that you're serious about buying the product while still trying to get a better price. With 4 rounds remaining, there's a chance to close the deal at a reasonable price, especially if Alice wants to avoid potentially going to John."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your target price of $1,200,000. While you are getting close to the price of buying from John, it's still worth trying to negotiate a better price.  You have 3 rounds left to try to get a better deal."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a slight increase from your previous offer but is still below Alice's current price of $995,000. This shows that you are willing to compromise but are not willing to go above your target price. It's a delicate balance to strike, as you only have 2 rounds remaining before you're forced to choose John's offer."

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your target price of $1,200,000.  With only one round left, the chances of securing a better price are slim. It's more advantageous to purchase from John, even though it's above your initial target, than to risk getting stuck with a price you're not comfortable with.  It's better to guarantee the purchase than to risk losing the product entirely."
