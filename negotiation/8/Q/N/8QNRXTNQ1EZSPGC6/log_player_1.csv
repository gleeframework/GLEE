"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $1,500,000, but it allows for negotiation room.  I want to gauge Bob's interest and see how much he's willing to pay. If he rejects, I can adjust my price in subsequent rounds."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'm not thrilled with the offer of $1,700,000, I'm starting to run out of time.  We are only two rounds away from selling the product to John for $1,500,000, which is a significant decrease from my initial goal.  It's best to accept this offer and secure a deal with Bob before we lose out on any potential profit."
