"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000.

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello again Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000.  Would that price point be possible?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're looking for a better price, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,5,
