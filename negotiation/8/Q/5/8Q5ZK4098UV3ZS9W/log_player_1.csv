"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $160 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 160} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good idea to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate down and still achieve a good outcome. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  This initial offer will help me understand how eager Bob is to buy. If he flat-out rejects it, I know he's quite price-sensitive.
* **Alternative Option:** Keeping John ($120 guaranteed sale) in mind, I'm not going to go too low too quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering. That price is a bit steep for me though. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Too Low:** Bob's offer of $60 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** While his offer is low, it shows he's interested. I'll counter in the next round to try and move the price closer to my target. 
* **John Option:** I'll keep John in my back pocket for now, but I want to see if I can get a better deal from Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $60 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for.  How about we meet in the middle? Would $110 work for you?"", ""product_price"": 110} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Jump But Still Above Bob's Value:** I increased the offer significantly from Bob's $60 to demonstrate willingness to negotiate but landed at a price still above his perceived value of $80.
* **Close to Minimum:** At $110, I'm getting very close to my minimum acceptable price. This signals to Bob that I'm serious but still open to a deal. 
* **Time Constraint:**  With limited rounds remaining, I need to start moving towards a closing price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $110 is still a bit much for my budget. Could we try something around $70? I think that would be a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:**  $70 is better than his previous offer, but it's still significantly below my $120 minimum.
* **Testing Resolve:** Bob's small increase might indicate he's not willing to go much higher. By rejecting, I'm gauging how serious he is about buying the product.
* **John as Leverage:**  I'm getting close to the point where accepting John's offer makes more sense than continuing to negotiate with Bob if he doesn't make a significant move soon."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a price that works, but I need to be honest, $70 is just too far off for me.  I'm willing to let it go for $95, but that's my absolute best offer.  I do have another interested buyer, so please let me know if you're interested, otherwise, I may need to move on."", ""product_price"": 95} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  I'm making it clear that $95 is my final offer and I'm not budging. This signals seriousness to Bob.
* **Justification:** Mentioning the other buyer (John) adds a sense of urgency and legitimacy to my position without revealing my exact alternative. 
* **Mid-Point:**  $95 is a compromise that's above Bob's perceived value but still a good deal for him if he really wants the product. 
* **Limited Time:** With only 5 rounds left, I need to know if Bob is willing to make a deal or if I should move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you have another buyer, but $95 is still a bit higher than I'd like to spend. I could do $80, and I'm ready to buy right now at that price.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached the Limit:** Bob has hit his maximum perceived value of $80. It's highly unlikely he'll go any higher.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John offers a guaranteed $120, which is significantly more than Bob's final offer. 
* **No More Time:**  With only a few rounds left, continuing with Bob carries the risk of him not budging, leaving me with a worse outcome than John's offer.

It's been a good negotiation attempt with Bob, but it's time to move on to a sure thing with John."
