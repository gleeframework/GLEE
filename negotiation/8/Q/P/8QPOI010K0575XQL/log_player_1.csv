"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140.  It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $140 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to go down to $130? That's the highest I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth at least $150 to Alice.  Selling to John guarantees that minimum. Bob's offer of $130 is too low.  Alice will try to get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $130 is a bit lower than I was hoping for.  How about we split the difference and settle on $135? That's still a great deal for you, and allows me to get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $135 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $132.  This is my final offer.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice should reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to her minimum, she still has a guaranteed $150 from John.  It's worth seeing if she can get a better deal from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're firm on your price.  $132 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but to keep the negotiation moving, I'm willing to come down to $134. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 134}
```"
