"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to make sure it's within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,100,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,075,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product for me.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,075,000 is unfortunately too low for me at this time.  I'm willing to meet you a little closer to your offer, however, and propose $1,125,000.  This still allows me to make a profit on the product while ensuring a great value for you. Let's make this work!",1125000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $1,125,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
