"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay around half of what you're asking. How about $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $11,000 is significantly below its value and what I'm willing to accept. Let's find a middle ground - how about $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  While $18,000 is better, it's still a bit out of my budget.  Could you consider $13,000?  I think that's a fair price.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. $13,000 is still quite a way off from what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $16,000? That's a significant reduction on my end.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, you're right, we are getting closer.  I'm willing to stretch my budget a little further. Would you be willing to do $14,000?  That's the best I can offer.",14000.0,Bob,6,
