,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $100?  This is still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise.",100.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still a bit high for me. I'm really keen on this product, but my budget is at $95.  Would you be open to that?",95.0,Bob,4,
