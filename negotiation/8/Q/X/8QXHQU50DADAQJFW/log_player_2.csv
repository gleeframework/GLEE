"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you our premium product for $9,500. This is a special opportunity considering its value to you is $8,000, and we believe it represents a fair deal. We look forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a good deal compared to the product's true worth to Alice ($10,000), you can potentially get a better price by negotiating further.  You are aiming for $8,000, so there's room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize the value of this product, my budget for it is a bit lower. I'm prepared to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. After careful consideration, I am willing to meet you halfway. I propose to sell the product for $8,750. This offer takes into account both the value you see in the product and the price you're comfortable with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While you can try to negotiate further, Alice's offer of $8,750 is a good deal.  It's only $750 more than your target price of $8,000, and it's likely that you won't be able to get a significantly better price."
