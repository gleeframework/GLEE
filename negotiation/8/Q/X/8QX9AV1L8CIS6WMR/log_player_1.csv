"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love! I'm offering it to you for $110.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price ($100) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product and the potential benefit for Bob. 
* **Room for Compromise:** I'm aware that Bob values the product at $80, so there's room for me to negotiate downwards if necessary. 
* **Alternative Option:** I'm keeping in mind that I have a backup buyer (John) who's willing to pay my minimum price, which gives me leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Higher Value:** While $90 is better than Bob's initial valuation of $80, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob, especially since he expressed interest in the product.
* **Leverage:**  I have a backup buyer (John) who's willing to pay my minimum price, giving me leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $90 is a bit too low for me. I'd be happy to meet you halfway at $95. It's still a good deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm still highlighting the value of the product and suggesting that Bob will be happy with it.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By offering $95, I'm still above my minimum acceptable price of $100, and I can still go to John if Bob rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go down to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Limited Room for Negotiation:** While there's still room to negotiate, I'm concerned that Bob might not be willing to go much higher. 
* **Alternative Option:**  I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who's willing to pay my minimum price.  Since further negotiation with Bob carries the risk of getting a lower price, it's safer to sell to John and secure my minimum value."
