"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $14,000 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $10,000.  It's in my best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  I have 10 rounds to make a deal, so there's time to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500, which is still a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

My counteroffer of $10,500 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer and reflects my maximum budget. I've still offered a price that's above my absolute limit, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still trying to secure a good deal. This initial counteroffer also allows for potential negotiation to reach a mutually agreeable price within the next few rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $13,000 is still above my maximum budget. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Alice, hoping to reach a price closer to my ideal. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet at $11,000? This price is fair for both of us and allows us to reach an agreement.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

My counteroffer of $11,000 is still within my budget but closer to Alice's latest offer. This shows continued negotiation while still trying to achieve a price closer to my target. By emphasizing fairness, I'm hoping to appeal to Alice's desire to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I see you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate that. However, $11,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,000 and $11,000, so I'm offering $12,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can agree on this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $12,000 is still above my maximum budget of $10,000. While there's potential for further negotiation, I've already had 4 rounds and it's becoming increasingly likely that Alice will not budge further. It's better to secure the product at my maximum budget by purchasing from John."
