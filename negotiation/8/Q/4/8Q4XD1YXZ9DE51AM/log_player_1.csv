Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can come to an agreement.

**Reasoning:**

Bob is bluffing. He's trying to pressure me by mentioning John and a higher price, but his actions throughout the negotiation show he's unwilling to pay more than $800,000. It's clear he's trying to get the best possible deal, which is understandable, but I have a guaranteed offer from John that meets my minimum. It's time to move on and secure a fair price for the product."
