Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200, which is significantly higher than my minimum of $150. This allows some room for negotiation and hopefully leads to a good deal for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$100 is far too low for me. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm offering $175, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's low offer.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, and selling to John would get me the same amount. So, I'll accept Bob's offer."
