This offer starts at a point slightly above Bob's value, leaving room for negotiation. It also expresses a willingness to compromise, potentially making Bob more inclined to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price."
