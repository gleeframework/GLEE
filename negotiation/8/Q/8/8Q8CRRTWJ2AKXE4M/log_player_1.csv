Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, at $2,000,000.  This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, while still being significantly above my minimum value. I'll see how he reacts and adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get more.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm coming down to $1,750,000. This is a compromise, showing willingness to negotiate while still being above my minimum.  I'm hoping this will get us closer to an agreement without having to go through multiple rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum of $1,500,000 and we've made progress in the negotiation.  It's not worth risking losing the deal by trying to squeeze out another $100,000."
