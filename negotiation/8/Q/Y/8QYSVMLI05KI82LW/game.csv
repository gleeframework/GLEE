"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $15,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a price that reflects its value to me.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me. This product would be worth $6,000 to me.  Would you be willing to come down to that price?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to both of us.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Could you do $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. Let's meet in the middle again, this time at $8,500. I think this is a fair price that balances our interests.",8500.0,Alice,5,
