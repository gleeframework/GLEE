{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product which I believe holds significant value for your business.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This reflects a balance between its worth and the unique benefits it offers you."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** I have a significant advantage knowing Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While starting high, the offer leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, making him feel like he's getting a slightly better deal.
* **Above My Minimum:**  The price is significantly above my $800,000 minimum, ensuring a substantial profit.
* **Balancing Profit and Risk:** Offering it too close to $1,500,000 might scare Bob away, while going too low leaves potential profit on the table. This price aims to secure a deal while maximizing my gain."
