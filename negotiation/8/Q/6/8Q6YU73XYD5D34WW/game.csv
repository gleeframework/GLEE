"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $15,000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. Can we meet in the middle?",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $20,000 is a bit too high of a drop.  How about we meet at $18,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and provide significant value.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $18,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget. How about we meet at $16,000? I'm still interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my means.",16000.0,Bob,4,
