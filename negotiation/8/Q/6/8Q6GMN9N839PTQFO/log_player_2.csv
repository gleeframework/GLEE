Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $115 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really looking to pay $100.  If you can't meet that, I might need to look at other options.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're really looking to get the product, Bob. I'm not willing to go as low as $100, but I'm willing to meet you at $112. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
