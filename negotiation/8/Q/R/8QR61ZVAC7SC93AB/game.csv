"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you starting the negotiation. While I'm interested, I'm not sure I can justify $1,100,000 at this point.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it's a fair deal.",1025000.0,Alice,3,,
