# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.  I know it's worth $800,000 to you, so this price offers you a significant return on your investment. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer

You should reject Alice's offer. While it is a good deal for her, it's still more expensive than buying it from John for $800,000. You want to save as much money as possible, so going with John is the best option."
