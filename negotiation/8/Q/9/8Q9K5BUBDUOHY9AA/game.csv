"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. It's a unique opportunity to own a high-quality item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $20000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Would you be willing to consider a price adjustment?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we discuss a price of $18000? I'm open to further negotiation, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $18000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm trying to be responsible with my finances. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, but $12000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet in the middle at $16000? I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'd be willing to sell it to you at that price.",16000.0,Alice,5,
