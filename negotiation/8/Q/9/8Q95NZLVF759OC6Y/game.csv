"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $12,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $11,500.  Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is significantly lower than what the product is worth.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,250?  That would be a fair deal for both of us.",10250.0,Alice,3,

"I see where you're coming from, Alice. While $10,250 is closer, I'm aiming for something a bit more budget-friendly. How about we settle at $9,500? ",9500.0,Bob,4,
