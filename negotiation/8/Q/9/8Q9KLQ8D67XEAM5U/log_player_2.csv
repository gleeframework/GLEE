"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great opportunity for you, Bob. This is a unique product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob ($15,000 vs. $10,000). It's better to try to negotiate a lower price.  There are still 9 rounds left to work with Alice, and a better price might be achievable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $10,500. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** This counteroffer starts at a price that's still higher than Bob's maximum, but it's a significant reduction from Alice's initial price. 
* **Fairness:** It demonstrates a willingness to negotiate but also sets a clear limit.
* **Room for compromise:** There's room for Alice to meet Bob halfway, potentially leading to a successful deal within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can see you're willing to go up to $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open, and gives Bob a chance to make another counteroffer. There are still 7 rounds left to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to go up to $11,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental increase:** This counteroffer increases Bob's offer by $1,000, showing a willingness to compromise while still staying within his budget.
* **Focus on finding a middle ground:** The message explicitly emphasizes finding a compromise, which could encourage Alice to be more flexible.
* **Still room for negotiation:** There's still space for Alice to make a smaller counteroffer, and both parties could potentially reach a deal in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're getting closer to my target, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** Even with her concession, Alice's offer is $4,000 above Bob's maximum budget. 
* **Limited rounds remaining:** With only 5 rounds left, there's not enough time to negotiate a price that works for both parties.
* **Guaranteed deal:**  Buying from John ensures Bob gets the product at his desired price, avoiding further negotiation and potential risk of not reaching a deal with Alice."
