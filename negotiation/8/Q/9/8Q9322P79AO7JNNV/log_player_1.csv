Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm initially setting the price at $19,000. I'm open to discussing a price that works for both of us, so feel free to counter."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have leverage. Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but potentially negotiable allows room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message implies you're willing to come down, encouraging Bob to engage in the conversation. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's ""value,"" you subtly anchor the price point in Bob's mind without explicitly revealing your minimum.

**Important Note:**  This strategy aims to maximize profit but does come with the slight risk of Bob rejecting outright. However, given your guaranteed sale to John, the potential for a higher profit from Bob might be worth the attempt."
