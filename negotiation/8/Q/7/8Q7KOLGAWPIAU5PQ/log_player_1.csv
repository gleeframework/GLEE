Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really value. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** $100 is above your minimum of $80, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  A price of $100 leaves room for Bob to counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **It's based on value:**  You're framing the offer by emphasizing the product's value to Bob, which can help him see it as a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is a bit lower than the initial offer of $100, it's still above your minimum price of $80 and secures a sale.  There's a chance you could push for a higher price in the next round, but accepting Bob's offer minimizes the risk of him walking away entirely or of having to settle for the lower price from John."
