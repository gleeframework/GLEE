{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it!  I'm offering it to you for $100. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's a little higher than my minimum price, but it gives me room to negotiate down if Bob isn't happy with it.  I'm also being friendly and positive to encourage him to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While I'd like to sell the product, $70 is below my minimum price. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest!  $70 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $85?  It's still a great deal for such a fantastic product!"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $85 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $75 is still below my minimum price of $80. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not willing to go below my minimum. It's better to sell to John and get my minimum price."
