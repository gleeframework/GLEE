"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $105. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant at $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $102.50?",102.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate that.  However, $102.50 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $110. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you say?",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to the price I'm willing to pay, but $110 is still a bit too high. I'll go up to $108, but that's my final offer.",108.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $108 is closer, I'm still needing to get closer to my asking price.  To make this deal work for both of us, I'm willing to go down to $112.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find the product well worth the investment.",112.0,Alice,7,
