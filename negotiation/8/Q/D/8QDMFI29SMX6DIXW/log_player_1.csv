Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,400,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. While $1,150,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not comfortable selling for that amount. I want to see if I can push for a slightly higher price."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $1,200,000 is a good price, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my ideal price point. With only 4 rounds left, I'm willing to risk it and try for a higher counteroffer."

Round 8
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

With only two rounds left, I need to make a decision. While I would prefer to get a higher price, Bob's offer is getting very close to my minimum, and selling to John for $1,000,000 would be a significant loss.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer and finalize the deal."
