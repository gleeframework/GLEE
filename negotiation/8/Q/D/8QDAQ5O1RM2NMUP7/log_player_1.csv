Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,500.  I believe it offers significant value at this price point and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", ""product_price"": 11500} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible without losing the sale.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting a bit high allows room for Bob to negotiate or feel like he's getting a slight deal if he accepts the initial offer. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** While we have John as a backup, getting closer to the higher price is ideal for maximizing profit. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. There's always a chance Bob might reject a high offer outright.  A different approach could involve a slightly lower initial offer to increase the likelihood of a quick sale."
