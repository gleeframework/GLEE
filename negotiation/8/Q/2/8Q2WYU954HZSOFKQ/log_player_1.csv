"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a little lower than my minimum value, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm aiming to get as close to my $12,000 value as possible, but I'm also aware that I have the option to sell to John at any time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $6,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get a better counteroffer from him. If not, I can always sell to John for $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is significantly lower than what I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This still leaves you a $1,000 profit on the product, and it's a fair price considering its value to me. Let's try to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value to you, but I have a budget I need to stick to. Would you consider $7,500? It's a significant increase from my previous offer and would allow us to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,500 is better than $6,000, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him closer to my target price in the next round. If not, I can always sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget to stick to, but $7,500 is still too far below my minimum value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $8,500. This would give you a decent profit, and it's a price I can comfortably accept. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
