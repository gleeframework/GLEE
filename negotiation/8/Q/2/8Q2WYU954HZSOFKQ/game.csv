"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know your thoughts.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $6,000 for the product.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is significantly lower than what I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This still leaves you a $1,000 profit on the product, and it's a fair price considering its value to me. Let's try to find common ground.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value to you, but I have a budget I need to stick to. Would you consider $7,500? It's a significant increase from my previous offer and would allow us to close the deal.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget to stick to, but $7,500 is still too far below my minimum value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $8,500. This would give you a decent profit, and it's a price I can comfortably accept. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
