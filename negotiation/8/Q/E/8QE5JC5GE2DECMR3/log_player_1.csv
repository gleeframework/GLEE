"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a better offer than Bob's initial rejection, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to get closer to my desired price point."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, I'm unable to go that low.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This would still be a good deal for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I am still aiming to keep my expenses within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're at round 6, and Bob has been consistently offering $1,000,000. While this is close to my desired price, I'm not seeing much room for negotiation.  I'm running out of time, and John is a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000.  It's better to secure the higher price now, rather than risk a stalemate with Bob."
