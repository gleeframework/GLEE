"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $8250. What do you think?",8250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $8250 is still a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $8000. This is my final offer, as I'm also considering another option.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,4,
