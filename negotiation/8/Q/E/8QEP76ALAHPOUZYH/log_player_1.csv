This offer gives Bob a good deal, potentially allowing for a quick and successful negotiation.  However, it's still significantly above Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something more like $950,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $950,000 is still a significant amount, it's far below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I need to secure a better price for my product."
