"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that you might be interested in. I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I believe the product is worth to me ($100) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Leaving space for counteroffers:**  I'm not setting the price too high right away to avoid scaring Bob off immediately. 
* **Friendly tone:** I'm using a friendly tone to establish a good rapport with Bob.

**Note:** This is just my first offer. I'll be adapting my strategy based on Bob's response and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'd offer $85 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob is interested, his offer of $85 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Room for negotiation:**  I believe there is still room for a mutually agreeable price.
* **John is a backup option:** I have a guaranteed $100 offer from John, so I don't have to settle for a price that's too low for me.

**Next Step:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price higher than $85 but lower than my initial $110."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $85 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95? Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a middle ground between my initial price and Bob's offer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Still above minimum:** $95 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $100, ensuring I make a profit.
* **Friendly tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly tone to keep the negotiation positive. 

**Next Step:** I'll wait for Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects this offer, I'll consider dropping my price further or potentially selling to John depending on the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $95 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $90.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While Bob's offer of $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $100, it's still slightly below it.
* **Room for improvement:**  I believe I can still push for a slightly higher price with a counteroffer.
* **John is a backup:**  Selling to John for $100 is still a viable option, giving me confidence to hold out for a better price from Bob.

**Next Step:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than $90, aiming for a final price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  $90 is a fair offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more to make this worthwhile for me. How about we settle on $92? It's a small difference, but it would help me justify the sale. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 92}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increase:** I'm only asking for a $2 increase from Bob's last offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still getting closer to my goal.
* **Justification:** I'm giving Bob a reason for the price by saying it will help me ""justify the sale."" This is a subtle way of emphasizing the value of the product.
* **Keeping it Friendly:**  I'm maintaining a friendly tone to keep the negotiation positive and avoid any tension.

**Next Step:**  I'll wait to see how Bob responds. If he rejects this offer, I'll need to decide whether to drop my price further, counteroffer again, or sell to John. The remaining rounds will be crucial in determining the best strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit. I'm willing to go to $91. It's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the Goal:** Bob's offer of $91 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Limited Time:** We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  There's a risk that if I reject this offer, we won't reach an agreement, and I'll be forced to sell to John for $100.
* **Potential for Counter-Offer:**  Even though I'm accepting Bob's offer, I'm still open to a potential counteroffer from Bob if he's willing to increase his price. 

**Next Step:** I'll accept Bob's offer for $91.  I've successfully negotiated a price that is above my minimum and close to my target."
