"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'd offer $85 for it. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $85 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95? Let me know what you think.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $95 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $90.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  $90 is a fair offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more to make this worthwhile for me. How about we settle on $92? It's a small difference, but it would help me justify the sale. What do you think?",92.0,Alice,5,
