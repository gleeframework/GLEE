"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product that I believe will be of great value to your company. Based on its potential, I'm setting the initial price at $950,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects its worth. Let me know your thoughts!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I think $950,000 is a bit steep. How about we settle around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $700,000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $850,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Could we possibly meet in the middle at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $775,000 simply doesn't cover the value I've placed on this product. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to stay above my minimum threshold. How about we split the difference and settle on $812,500? This would be a win-win situation for both of us, ensuring a fair deal for both parties. ",812500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $812,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we make it $790,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value of the product and allows me to stay within my budget.",790000.0,Bob,6,
