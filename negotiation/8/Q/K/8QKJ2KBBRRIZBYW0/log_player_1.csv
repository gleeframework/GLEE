"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product that I believe will be of great value to your company. Based on its potential, I'm setting the initial price at $950,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects its worth. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I think $950,000 is a bit steep. How about we settle around $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $700,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I believe I can still negotiate a better deal with Bob, and I have 9 rounds left to do so."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $700,000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $850,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Could we possibly meet in the middle at $775,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $775,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired outcome. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm not ready to settle yet. I'll continue working with Bob to find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $775,000 simply doesn't cover the value I've placed on this product. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to stay above my minimum threshold. How about we split the difference and settle on $812,500? This would be a win-win situation for both of us, ensuring a fair deal for both parties. "", ""product_price"": 812500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $812,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we make it $790,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value of the product and allows me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $790,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $790,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000.  While I would prefer to get more from Bob, I've reached a point where I need to secure a sale.  Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum, but I'm worried that if I keep rejecting them, we might not reach a deal within the remaining rounds.  It's better to guarantee a sale with John and move on."
