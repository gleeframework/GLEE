# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,370,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly interested and negotiating, but he's moving slowly. While his offer is getting closer to our minimum, we still have room to negotiate and time before considering John's offer. We need to show firmness but also a willingness to deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your constraints, but I need you to understand the value of what I'm offering. I've adjusted my price significantly already. Let's settle this now - $1,378,000, and we have a deal."",
""product_price"": 1378000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Firmness:**  The message is direct and firm, emphasizing that Bob needs to recognize the product's value. We've been flexible, but we're reaching a limit.
* **Urgency:**  By saying ""Let's settle this now,"" we introduce a sense of urgency, pushing for a decision without being overly aggressive.
* **Compromise:**  The price is a small concession, signaling that we're willing to move a bit but holding firm at a level significantly above our minimum.

This strategy aims to get Bob to agree quickly while still securing a good price."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Respectfully, Alice, I am unable to meet your current offer. I would like to propose a final price of $1,365,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,365,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,365,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:**  While not ideal, $1,365,000 is still a significant profit above our $1,200,000 minimum.  Continuing to push Bob risks him walking away.
* **Time Constraint:**  We're running out of rounds. If we reject this offer and Bob doesn't significantly increase his next one, we might be forced to accept a worse deal or go with John's offer.
* **""Final Price"" Signal:**  Bob used the phrase ""final price,"" indicating he's unlikely to go higher. Rejecting this might make him reconsider his position entirely. 

It's a tough call, but at this stage, accepting secures a good profit and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
