"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm looking to keep my spending within $8,000. Would you consider selling it to me for $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  This price still gives you a great deal and is closer to what I need to make this worthwhile for me.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. I've done some research and found a similar product elsewhere for $8,000. Would you consider meeting me halfway at $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and the research you've done.  While I understand the price point you're aiming for, $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the unique features and value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $11,500.  This price reflects a compromise from my previous offer and gives you a great deal.  What do you say?",11500.0,Alice,5,
