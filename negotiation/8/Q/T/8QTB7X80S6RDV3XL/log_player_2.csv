It's better to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before buying from John.  You can start by making a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $950,000 is a bit high for my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $850,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"

# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still willing to work with you. After considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and the market. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

You're still $100,000 over your ideal price. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice.  Let's see if you can get closer to your target."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  This is a fair offer, and I'm confident we can reach a deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'll meet you halfway between $900,000 and $875,000, which is $887,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While this offer is close to your ideal price, it's still worth trying to negotiate further.  You're only $87,500 away from your goal. You have 5 rounds left, so you can keep trying to find a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $887,500 is still a bit above what I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to go to $862,500, which is a good compromise. Let's make this deal happen. "", ""product_price"": 862500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $862,500. I'll meet you halfway between $887,500 and $862,500, which is $874,750. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $874,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $874,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You've reached a point where the negotiation is getting close to your ideal price, but Alice is being stubborn.  You have 3 rounds left, and while you could continue to counteroffer, there's a risk Alice will reject you and you'll be forced to accept her offer.  To guarantee you get the product within your budget, it's safer to buy from John at this point."
