"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within a tight budget. Can you meet me at $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $110 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $125?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $125 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $120. How about $115? I'm really interested in the product and I think we can find a mutually beneficial price.",115.0,Bob,4,
