Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within a tight budget. Can you meet me at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to sell at $110, I can still potentially get a better price by continuing the negotiation.  I am confident that I can get at least $120, and potentially even more, if I continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $110 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $125?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $125 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $120. How about $115? I'm really interested in the product and I think we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $115 is a good compromise. It is higher than his previous offer of $110, and I am confident that I can get a better price than John's offer of $120. Therefore, I will accept Bob's offer and sell the product to him for $115."
