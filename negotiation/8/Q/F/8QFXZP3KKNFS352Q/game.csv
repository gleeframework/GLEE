"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,100,000 is unfortunately out of my budget.  Considering the value I see in the product, I'm willing to offer $900,000.  This price is within my range, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value we both see.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the gap between $900,000 and my initial asking price is substantial.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end while still acknowledging the inherent value of the product.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $950,000.  This price is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the value we both see in this product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer.  I recognize your willingness to negotiate, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. To that end, I'm proposing a price of $985,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal considering the true value of this product.",985000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, $985,000 is still above my target price.  To close this deal, I'm willing to offer $925,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I'm confident it represents a fair price for both of us.",925000.0,Bob,6,
