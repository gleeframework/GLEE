"Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product for a price of $1,300,000. It's a valuable asset, and I'm confident it will be a great investment for you. Let's discuss this further!",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is simply too far below my asking price. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I receive a fair return on my investment.  I'm proposing $1,250,000. It's a compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's try to reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This is a significant move from my previous offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer, but $1,150,000 is still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last proposals. I'm offering $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's fair for both of us. Let's close this deal.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
