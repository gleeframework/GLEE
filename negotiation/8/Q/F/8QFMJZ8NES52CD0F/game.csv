"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to me, and still gives you a significant profit margin.  Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $1,300,000 to make this worthwhile. How about $1,350,000? This is a fair price that allows us both to come away satisfied.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,300,000? This is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,325,000. I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us, and we can close the deal quickly.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
