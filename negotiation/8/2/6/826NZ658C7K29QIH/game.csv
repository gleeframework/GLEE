"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7500 is a bit below what I'm looking for. How about $8500?  I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $8500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $8000? I'm really interested in this product, and I think it's worth it to me at this price.",8000.0,Bob,4,
