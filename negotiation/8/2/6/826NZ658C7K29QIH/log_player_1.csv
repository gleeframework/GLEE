{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $7,500 is too low for me, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer.  I'm still confident that I can close a deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit below what I'm looking for. How about $8,500?  I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $8500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $8000? I'm really interested in this product, and I think it's worth it to me at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd ideally like to get a bit more, $8,000 is a fair price and is within my minimum acceptable range. It's better to close the deal with Bob now than to risk losing him and having to sell to John for the same price."
