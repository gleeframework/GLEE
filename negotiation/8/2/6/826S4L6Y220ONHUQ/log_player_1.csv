Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $1000000. This is a fair price given the product's value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low. It's worth taking a risk and seeing if we can get a better deal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,000,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, which is still a great price considering the value you'll gain from the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $1500000.  I'm willing to go up to $1250000, which is a significant compromise on my part. I believe this is a fair price given the value I'll gain from the product. Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

While $1,250,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,375,000. This represents a significant concession from my previous offer, and it's a price that reflects the value you'll gain from the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1375000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1375000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1125000. I'm hoping we can find a middle ground here.  This is a fair price given the value I'll gain from the product.  Let's make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000.
