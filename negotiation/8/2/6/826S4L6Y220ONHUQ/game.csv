"Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $1000000. This is a fair price given the product's value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1000000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1500000, which is still a great price considering the value you'll gain from the product. Let's meet in the middle.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $1500000.  I'm willing to go up to $1250000, which is a significant compromise on my part. I believe this is a fair price given the value I'll gain from the product. Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable solution.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1250000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1375000. This represents a significant concession from my previous offer, and it's a price that reflects the value you'll gain from the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1375000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1125000 is simply not enough. I'm willing to lower my price to $1250000, which is still a good deal for you given the value you'll gain from the product. Let's meet in the middle and reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1250000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1100000. This is a fair price considering the value I'll gain from the product, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on. Let's close the deal.",1100000.0,Bob,8,
