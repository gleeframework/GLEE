"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is truly significant, and $800,000 undervalues it considerably. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product has significant value, but I'm still not convinced that $1,250,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like to propose a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
