"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its features and value, I'm asking for $22,000. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  Thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is a bit higher than I'm able to go right now. Given my budget, I'm willing to offer $10,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?  I'm confident you'll see a great return on this investment.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $18,000 is still too high.  I'm sticking to my offer of $10,000.  This is the most I can afford right now. If you're not comfortable with that, I might have to look at other options.",10000.0,Bob,4,
