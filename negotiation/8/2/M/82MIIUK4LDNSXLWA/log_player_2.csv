"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its features and value, I'm asking for $22,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $22,000 is far above my budget of $8,000.  It's too risky to accept this offer.  I'll reject it and see if I can negotiate a better price in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  Thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is a bit higher than I'm able to go right now. Given my budget, I'm willing to offer $10,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?  I'm confident you'll see a great return on this investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $18,000 is a better offer than $22,000, it's still above my $8,000 budget.  I'm going to reject this offer and continue negotiating in hopes of getting a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $18,000 is still too high.  I'm sticking to my offer of $10,000.  This is the most I can afford right now. If you're not comfortable with that, I might have to look at other options."", ""product_price"": 10000}
