"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to try to get a better deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $8,500, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $9,000? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $8,750. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value to me is $8,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,750 is close to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a bit more.  I'm going to counteroffer again, but if this doesn't work, I'll be ready to sell to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $8,875. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8875}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise again, but $8,875 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $8,750.

Bob is clearly not willing to budge further.  I'm getting close to my minimum, but I'm not sure I can get a higher price in the remaining rounds. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $8,000."
