"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is simply too low. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. It's a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle on $12,500? This price would be a fair compromise, and I'd be happy to purchase the product immediately.",12500.0,Bob,4,
