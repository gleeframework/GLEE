"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. $14,000 is more than his maximum budget, so he should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is simply too low. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. It's a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is closer to his budget, he can still try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle on $12,500? This price would be a fair compromise, and I'd be happy to purchase the product immediately."", ""product_price"": 12500}
