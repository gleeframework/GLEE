"Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate the recommendation. However, I was hoping to stay within my budget of $100 for this purchase. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $105? It's still a good price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think!",105.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking to keep the price within my budget. Could we perhaps aim for $98? This would allow me to stay within my financial limits while also providing you with a reasonable profit.",98.0,Bob,4,
