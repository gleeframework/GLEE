This offer is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum desired price. It's a good starting point to see if we can reach a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  I think it's a fair price considering it has a lower value for me than for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I need to try and get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $800,000 is simply too low for me. I understand the product has a different value for you, but I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price still gives you a good deal and allows me to get closer to my desired value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
