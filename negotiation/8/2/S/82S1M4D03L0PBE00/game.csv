"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $140. I'm willing to pay that much for the product. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I value your offer, $140 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'd need $160 for the product. Let's find a middle ground! ",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $160 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $145. I'm willing to pay that much for the product. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm still interested in working with you. $145 is close, but I'm looking for a bit more. Let's meet in the middle at $155.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. ",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $155 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $145 and $155, which would be $150. I'm willing to pay that much for the product. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",150.0,Bob,6,
