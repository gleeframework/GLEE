Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value of $1,200,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation (if Bob counters) while still securing a significant profit. 
* **John as a Back-up:** Knowing there's a guaranteed sale at $800,000 provides a safety net.  Alice can be more ambitious with her initial offer to Bob."
