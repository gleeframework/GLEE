"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is too close to your maximum budget. There's a good chance you can negotiate a lower price, especially since you know the product is worth significantly less to Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  This offer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but still above her perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Demonstrating Seriousness:** By offering a concrete number, you show you're serious about buying but want a price that works for you. 
* **Anchoring:**  This initial offer aims to ""anchor"" the negotiation closer to your desired price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest. While I understand your perspective, $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider a price of $1,350,000. This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is moving closer to your desired price range, but there's still room for negotiation. She's dropped $50,000, indicating she's willing to bargain. You can likely get her closer to $1,200,000, especially since you have John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm getting closer to what I can do.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000?"",
""product_price"": 1225000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  You're showing willingness to compromise by increasing your offer, but not by a large amount.
* **Targeting the Midpoint:** This counteroffer aims for roughly the midpoint between your previous offer and Alice's current offer.
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  While you're moving closer, you're still a significant amount below her asking price, keeping the pressure on her to negotiate. 
* **John as Leverage:** You haven't revealed your alternative option, so Alice might be more willing to come down further if she thinks you'll walk away."
