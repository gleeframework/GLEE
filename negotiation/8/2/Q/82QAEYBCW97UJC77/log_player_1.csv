``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum value of $8,000 but leaves room for negotiation to reach a price closer to Bob's $10,000 valuation.  I'll see how Bob reacts and adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $8,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

While I'm happy with $8,000, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $9,000."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value this product at more than $8,000, I'm willing to compromise. How about $8,800?  This price still allows me to earn a fair amount, and I believe it's a good value for you considering the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 8800}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I am still aiming to keep my spending within $8,000. Could we perhaps agree on $8,500 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

I'll accept Bob's offer. Although it's not my ideal price, it's higher than John's offer, and it's worth it to close the deal without further negotiation."
