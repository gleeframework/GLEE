Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $20,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Gauging Interest:** By offering it at $20,000,  we can assess Bob's level of interest. If he accepts immediately, we've secured a great deal. If he counter-offers, we know he's interested but wants to negotiate. 
* **Backup Plan:**  We have the security of John's offer at $15,000, ensuring we don't lose money if Bob rejects the initial offer."
