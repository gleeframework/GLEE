"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me and your profit margin. Let's see if we can work something out.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm offering $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and your potential profit.  Let's close this deal!",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $1,030,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1030000.0,Alice,5,
