We have plenty of room to negotiate down from Alice's initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $80?"", ""product_price"": 80} 

**Reasoning:**  Starting with a significantly lower counter-offer gives us more room to negotiate upwards while still staying well below our $120 limit."

Round 3

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we split the difference and settle on $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price below Alice's last offer.  It also keeps the negotiation moving forward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're open to negotiation, Bob. Considering your feedback, how does $87.50 sound for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down considerably from her initial offer. While we might be able to squeeze out a few more dollars, $87.50 is a good price, and continuing to negotiate risks alienating Alice or running out of rounds. It's a solid deal and time to accept."
