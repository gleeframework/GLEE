"Bob, I have a unique product I believe you'd find highly valuable. I'm asking $1500000 for it. It's a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll see the potential return. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  While $1200000 is tempting, I need to be closer to my target to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000.  This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it reflects the true value of this product. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
