"Hi Alice,  Thanks for the offer.  $15000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer, but $8000 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11000, which is still a good deal for a product of this quality.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $9500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $10500.  I'm not sure how much lower I can go, but I'm really hoping to come to an agreement. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,5,
