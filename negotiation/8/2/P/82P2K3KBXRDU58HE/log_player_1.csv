Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Understanding Bob's value:**  I know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, so I'm aiming for a price closer to that, but not too close to risk him accepting immediately.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** By starting high, I create room for counteroffers and potential back-and-forth, giving me the opportunity to gauge Bob's real interest and maximize my profit.
* **John as a backup:** Having John as a potential buyer at $1,000,000 gives me a safety net. If the negotiation with Bob stalls or becomes too unfavorable, I can always go with John and still secure a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $1,200,000 is better than John's offer, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,400,000, or at least closer to the middle ground of our current valuations.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** Bob's offer demonstrates that he's interested in buying the product. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my target, leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Avoiding a quick sale:** Accepting Bob's offer might seem tempting, but it would mean settling for a lower price than I might be able to achieve with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Moving towards the middle:** I'm lowering my offer to $1,300,000, which is closer to Bob's counteroffer of $1,200,000. This shows that I'm willing to compromise and find a solution that works for both of us.
* **Maintaining a good margin:** Even with the lower price, I'm still earning a significant amount more than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Testing Bob's limits:** This counteroffer allows me to see if Bob is willing to go higher or if he's set on his $1,200,000 offer. 
* **Staying flexible:** By counteroffering, I keep the negotiation open and allow for potential further adjustments in price if necessary."
