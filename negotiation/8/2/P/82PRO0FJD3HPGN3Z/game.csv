"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product for a price of $1,150,000. This is a significant value considering its worth to you, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me to consider. It doesn't reflect the true value of this product, and frankly, I could sell it to John for $1,000,000 right now. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a great deal for you, given the product's worth to you.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
