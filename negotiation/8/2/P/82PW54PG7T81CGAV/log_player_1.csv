Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal considering the value it holds. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is a good starting point given my minimum value of $15,000 and Bob's estimated value of $10,000. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This offer leaves room for negotiation, allowing Bob to counter without feeling like he's being taken advantage of. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to establish a positive negotiation atmosphere. 
* **John as a Backup:** Remember, I have John as a backup buyer willing to pay $15,000. This gives me the leverage to walk away if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I would like to counteroffer at $10,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  Bob's offer of $10,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe I can still get a better price from Bob, especially since I have John as a backup buyer. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows the negotiation to continue and potentially lead to a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $10,000 is significantly lower than what I need to sell. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone to keep the negotiation open.
* **Room for further negotiation:** I'm leaving some room for negotiation, as I can still make a higher offer to John if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of your product, I would like to counteroffer at $10,000. I believe this is a fair price given my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is inflexible:** Bob has been insistent on his $10,000 offer, demonstrating that he's unlikely to budge further.
* **John offers a better deal:** John is offering $15,000, which is well above my minimum price and significantly higher than Bob's final offer. 
* **Time is valuable:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could take time and potentially result in a lower price than John's offer. 

Selling to John guarantees me a profitable outcome and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
