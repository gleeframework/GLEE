"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way over your budget. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price. You have 10 rounds to work with, so there's time to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant discount from Alice's initial offer.  This shows I'm serious about negotiating and gives room for compromise.  I'm hoping to get a deal closer to my $800,000 limit, but I'm starting lower to see where Alice is willing to go."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still slightly above my limit. I want to see if I can get it down to $800,000 or even slightly lower.  I still have time to negotiate, so I'll try to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing that I'm willing to compromise.  This is a reasonable middle ground between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer.  I'm hoping this will entice Alice to accept, but I'm still prepared to make a final counteroffer if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now at my limit.  There's no guarantee that I can get a lower price in the remaining rounds.  If I reject and make a counteroffer, there's a risk that she'll counter back with an even higher price or that we'll run out of time. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product for the best price I'm willing to pay."
