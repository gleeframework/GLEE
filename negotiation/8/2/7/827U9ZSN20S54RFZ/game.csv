"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $11,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $10,500. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $9,750?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,750 is still a bit lower than my desired price, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10200.0,Alice,5,
