"Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me.  I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $800,000 at this time. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I could consider $1,700,000.  This reflects its unique aspects while acknowledging your interest.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,700,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?  This would allow us both to achieve a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
