"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000 to meet you halfway. This price still allows me to make a good profit, and it's a significant discount from my initial offer.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'm willing to go up to $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the fact that you're willing to meet me halfway.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're still within your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's compromise at $975,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away with a positive outcome.  I'm confident this is a reasonable offer, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $987,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",987500.0,Bob,6,
