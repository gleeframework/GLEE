Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. After careful consideration, I understand your position. However, I must respectfully decline your offer of $850,000. Our product is unique and valuable, and I believe it deserves a higher valuation. I would like to propose $900,000 as a more reasonable price for you to consider. I look forward to your thoughts on this proposal.

While $900,000 is closer to my target, it's still above my ideal price. I'm willing to negotiate further, aiming to get closer to my target of $800,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. After reviewing your latest offer, I've decided to counter with $890,000. This reflects a compromise while still valuing the product appropriately. I believe this figure will be acceptable for both parties and I look forward to your response.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $890,000 is very close to my target price of $800,000.  It's a good compromise, and I'm willing to accept it.  Buying from John at $1,000,000 would cost me a lot more, so this is a much better deal."
