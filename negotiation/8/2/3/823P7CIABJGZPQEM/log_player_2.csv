Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair here. $10,750 is really cutting it close to my bottom line, but I'm willing to accept if you can finalize the deal right now.  Otherwise, I think it's best we part ways. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This is a good time to accept the offer. Alice is signaling that this is her bottom line and she might be willing to walk away from the deal.  While you could try to push for a slightly lower price, you risk her accepting another offer or deciding to keep the product. Accepting $10,750 gets you the product below your $12,000 maximum and saves you a decent amount compared to buying from John."
