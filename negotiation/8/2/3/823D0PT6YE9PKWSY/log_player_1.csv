"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with an aggressive offer, but one that still leaves room for negotiation.  Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to me, I want to maximize my profit.  Offering $1,100,000 is a significant discount from my minimum value, but it still leaves a substantial profit margin.  I believe this price will be attractive to Bob, as it is well below what he is willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still significantly lower than what I want to get. I have 8 rounds left and I'm confident I can push for a higher price. I'm also not in a rush to sell, as I have the option of selling to John for a much higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still holding out for a higher price.  $1,050,000 is a good compromise, as it's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's latest offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I believe the product is worth more. This strategy is designed to keep the negotiation moving forward while still maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my desired price and only slightly better than his previous offer. I'm not willing to settle yet, as I have 6 rounds left and still have the option to sell to John for a much higher price. I believe I can push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm making a final concession to try and secure a deal with Bob. $1,000,000 is a strong price point for me as it still ensures a good profit, and it's closer to Bob's latest offer. This counteroffer shows I'm serious about a deal but also that I'm not willing to go lower. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely go ahead and sell to John as I'm running out of rounds and there's no guarantee Bob will continue to increase his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still not ideal. With only four rounds left, the chances of him increasing his offer enough to satisfy me are slim.  I'm running out of time, and I'd rather secure the guaranteed profit from selling to John."
