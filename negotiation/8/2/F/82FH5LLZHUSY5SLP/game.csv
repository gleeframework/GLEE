"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,150,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,150,000 is a bit high. Would you consider $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $950,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider letting it go for $1,100,000. This offer represents a fair compromise. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,100,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something below $1,000,000.  Would you be open to $980,000?",980000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To be frank, $980,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line. I'm willing to accept $1,050,000, but that's my final offer. This price reflects the true value of the product. Let me know your decision.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for being upfront. I understand this is your bottom line, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?  It's a fair deal for both of us.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
