"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. It's worth at least $800,000 to me, and I'm confident it would be equally valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $850,000. This price reflects its significant potential. Please consider this offer carefully.  If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who's willing to pay the full $800,000.",850000.0,Alice,1,
