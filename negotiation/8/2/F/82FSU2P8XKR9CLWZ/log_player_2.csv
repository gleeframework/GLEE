{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:**  Alice is selling for $110, while John is selling for $120. 
* **You are willing to spend up to $120:** Even though the product is only worth $80 to Alice, it's worth $120 to you, so the offer is within your budget."
