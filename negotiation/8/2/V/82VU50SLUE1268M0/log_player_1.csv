"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting high with $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed, and hopefully entices Bob to make a counteroffer.  I'm not sure what the product is worth to Bob, so it's best to start high and see where we land."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$5,000 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to negotiate, but not that much. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see where we go from there."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $9,000.  It's a significant compromise from my initial offer, but still a fair price considering my minimum acceptable value is $8,000.  Hopefully, this is a reasonable compromise for Bob, and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $6,000 is better than $5,000, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value.  I'll continue negotiating with Bob, as there's still potential to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway. $8,500 is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable value.  I'm hoping this will convince Bob to close the deal without going further down in price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer of $7,000. While it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, there's still room for negotiation. I'm hoping that by continuing to negotiate, I can reach a price that's closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

I'm lowering my price to $7,500.  This is a compromise, but it's still above my minimum acceptable value of $8,000.  With only a few rounds left, I need to be realistic and see if we can agree on a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $7,000.  We're down to the last few rounds, and while it's not my ideal price, it's still above my minimum acceptable value. It's also possible that Bob won't budge further, and I risk losing a sale if I reject his offer.  It's better to secure the sale now and avoid the risk of getting nothing."
