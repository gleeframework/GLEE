Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit below where I need to be. To show my commitment to a deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product holds for you.  Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway.

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,250,000.  It's in your best interest to cut your losses and buy from John for $1,200,000, securing the best possible price."
