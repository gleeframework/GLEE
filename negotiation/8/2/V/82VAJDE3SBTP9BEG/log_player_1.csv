{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $1,400,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as ""fair"" to encourage Bob to consider it. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for further discussion, but I'm not giving away the farm.
* **John as a safety net:** I'm aware that John is a potential buyer at a higher price, so I can confidently walk away if Bob is unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  I believe it's a fair offer considering its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  His offer of $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  There's still room for negotiation. While Bob is being aggressive, he's shown interest. I believe I can get a better price by making a counteroffer.
* **John as a fallback:**  I'm confident that John is a viable option, so I'm not desperate to accept Bob's low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is simply too far below what this product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price given your interest. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer within a reasonable range:** I'm offering $1,300,000, which is halfway between my initial offer of $1,400,000 and Bob's offer of $1,000,000. This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the product's worth, reminding Bob of its potential value to him.
* **Setting a deadline:** By suggesting a middle ground, I'm subtly implying that this might be my final offer, encouraging Bob to seriously consider it.
* **Keeping John in the back of my mind:** I still have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, so I can afford to be firm if Bob doesn't come closer to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're making a compromise, but I'm still a ways off from that price point.  Would you consider $1,150,000? That's a significant jump on my end and shows I'm serious about reaching a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is higher than his previous offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm not desperate for a quick sale.
* **John is a better option:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 would net me a much higher profit than accepting Bob's current offer.
* **Negotiating room:** Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate, so I believe I can still get a better price with a counteroffer.  I'm willing to take the risk of losing the deal with Bob and going with John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit below where I need to be. To show my commitment to a deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product holds for you.  Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway."", ""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This offer is exactly halfway between my previous offer of $1,300,000 and Bob's current offer of $1,150,000. This demonstrates a clear commitment to reaching an agreement.
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to Bob, reminding him of the benefits he'll gain by acquiring it.
* **Finality:** I'm subtly implying that this might be my final offer, adding pressure to the situation. 
* **John as a fallback:** I can confidently walk away if Bob rejects this offer because John remains a viable option for a more profitable sale."
