"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  I believe it's a fair offer considering its value.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is simply too far below what this product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price given your interest. Let's meet in the middle.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're making a compromise, but I'm still a ways off from that price point.  Would you consider $1,150,000? That's a significant jump on my end and shows I'm serious about reaching a deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit below where I need to be. To show my commitment to a deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product holds for you.  Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
