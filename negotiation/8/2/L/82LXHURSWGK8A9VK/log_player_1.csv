Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item to you for $175. I think you'll find it's a great deal for what it offers."", 
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $100, starting with a higher price leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Above Your Minimum:** The offer of $175 ensures that even if Bob negotiates down, you're likely to get a price above your minimum of $150.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  You have the safety net of John who will buy the product for $150, so you can afford to be a bit bolder in your initial offer to Bob."
