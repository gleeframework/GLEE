"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $12,000. This is a significant discount from what I could sell it for elsewhere. If you're interested, let me know and we can discuss the details.  If you decide to pass, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to purchase it at full price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
