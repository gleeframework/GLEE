"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $9,750? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",9750.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to settle at $9,750. I can do $10,200, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",10200.0,Alice,5,
