Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,400,000** is a good starting point. It's above my minimum of $1,200,000 and still leaves room for negotiation.
* **The message** is friendly and emphasizes the value the product holds for Bob, making it more likely he'll consider my offer. 
* **Remember:** I have a backup buyer (John) willing to pay $1,200,000, so I can walk away if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.** It's my absolute minimum and doesn't leave me any room for profit. 
* **Rejecting allows for further negotiation.**  I can make a counteroffer to try and get a better price.
* **Selling to John now is pointless.** I can potentially get more from Bob if I continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is a fair price considering the value this product holds for you."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer of $1,400,000 and Bob's offer of $1,200,000.
* **Message:** The message emphasizes the value the product holds for Bob and frames the counteroffer as a fair compromise.
* **Strategy:** By splitting the difference, I'm showing flexibility while still trying to get a price closer to my initial expectation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1350000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is now close to my desired price.**  $1,350,000 is only $50,000 less than my original offer of $1,400,000.
* **It's a good deal.** This offer secures a price that's significantly better than my fallback option of selling to John for $1,200,000.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better price.** Bob is clearly not willing to go much higher, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether."
