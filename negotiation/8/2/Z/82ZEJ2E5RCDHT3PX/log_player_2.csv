{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is better than $10,000, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $8,500, which is still above Alice's desired selling price of $8,000 but significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $9,000.  This shows Bob is serious about negotiating while still leaving room for a potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,200 is still higher than Bob's desired price. While it's closer to his initial target of $8,500, Bob is still willing to negotiate further and try to get a lower price. There's still room for a better deal, and rejecting this offer keeps that possibility open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $8,750. This is a slight increase from his previous offer of $8,500, showing flexibility and a willingness to meet halfway. It's still below Alice's offer of $9,200, but closer to her desired selling price. This demonstrates Bob's seriousness about making a deal while still aiming for a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,400 is getting closer to Bob's maximum budget, but it's still higher than he'd ideally like to pay. At this point, the negotiations are getting more time-consuming, and Bob is likely to be frustrated with Alice's unwillingness to budge significantly.  

Considering the time and effort spent already, it's likely Bob is better off cutting his losses and buying the product from John for $10,000.  While this is not the ideal price, it's within Bob's budget and ensures a quicker transaction."
