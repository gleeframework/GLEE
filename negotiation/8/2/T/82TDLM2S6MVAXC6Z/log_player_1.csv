Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,200,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $800,000, but it leaves room for negotiation.  

**Why this strategy?**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  A high initial offer aims for the highest possible price. 
* **Testing the Waters:** It allows me to gauge Bob's interest level and his perceived value of the product.
* **Negotiation Leverage:**  By starting high, I create space for concessions later without jeopardizing my minimum acceptable price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** I'll analyze Bob's response. If he accepts, I've secured a great deal.
* **Counteroffer:** If Bob rejects, I'll carefully consider his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a new counteroffer. 
* **John's Offer:** If negotiations with Bob stall or I feel I'm not getting a good price, I can always revert to John's guaranteed offer of $800,000."
