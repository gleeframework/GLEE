{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a fantastic deal, as you know it's worth a lot more to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum price of $8,000, giving Bob some room to negotiate.  It also leaves room for me to lower the price a bit if needed. However, it's still significantly lower than the product's value to Bob, which gives me room to potentially make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $10,000? It's still a good deal for you, and a great price for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to sell for that price just yet. I still believe I can get a better price by continuing negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  That's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $10,500 is a good compromise. It's still significantly higher than my minimum price of $8,000 and brings the negotiation closer to a resolution.  While I'd prefer a higher price, I don't want to risk losing the deal and ending up with a lower offer from John."
