{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This initial offer starts high, at $10,000. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn more than my minimum value of $8,000. It's also important to remember that I can always fall back on selling to John if Bob rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a great product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8500 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is close to my minimum value, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand that $10,000 was a bit high.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250, as this product is truly special and worth every penny. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

I'm still aiming for a price higher than my minimum, but I'm willing to compromise a bit more. By offering $9,250, I'm signaling that I'm serious about selling to Bob, while still maintaining a good profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9250 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8750? This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,750 is a good compromise and a reasonable price. It's higher than what I would get from John and closer to my desired price. I'm going to accept Bob's offer and sell the product to him."
