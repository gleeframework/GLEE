"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of the product. Would you be willing to consider this counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. I'm willing to be flexible, but $900,000 is too low for me to consider.  Could you meet me halfway at $1,000,000? This offer reflects the true value of this product.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $950,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
