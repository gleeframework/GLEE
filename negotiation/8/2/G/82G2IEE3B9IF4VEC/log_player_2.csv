"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $75 is a good deal, it's still possible to get a lower price. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if Alice is willing to drop the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 65}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's a significant drop from Alice's initial price. This shows I'm serious about getting a good deal and encourages Alice to consider negotiating. I'm also keeping in mind that I have a backup option with John, so I don't need to settle for a price I'm not comfortable with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $70
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price slightly from the initial offer, and $70 is a reasonable price that falls within my budget.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a chance Alice might not budge further, and I risk running out of rounds. Accepting her offer ensures I get the product at a decent price and avoids potentially losing out to John."
