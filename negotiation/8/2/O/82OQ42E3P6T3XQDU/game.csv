"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product. I believe it's worth a substantial amount to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1500000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product seems interesting, but $1500000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for it. This is a fair price for the potential value I see in this product.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1000000 is a bit lower than my initial ask, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer the product to you for $1250000. This is a compromise that I think reflects the value I believe the product holds, while still being a good deal for you.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1100000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the potential value and my maximum budget.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1100000, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1200000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great value for the product's unique features and benefits.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
