Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's well worth the investment for you. Let's talk!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $1,750,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. This sets a strong initial position.
* **Emphasis on value:** My message highlights the value proposition for Bob, suggesting it's a good deal for him.
* **Openness to discussion:** I invite Bob to talk, signaling flexibility and willingness to find common ground. 
* **Plan B:** I'm aware that John is willing to pay my minimum, so I have a backup option if the negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,750,000 is far above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for your product. This price is still a good deal for you, as it's above your minimum valuation. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While it's above my minimum, it's still significantly below my desired profit margin.  
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I'm confident that I can negotiate a higher price with Bob. I have several rounds left, and I can use John's offer as leverage.
* **No rush:**  I'm not under pressure to sell immediately, so I can afford to be patient and see if Bob will come up with a more attractive offer."

* **Still below my target:**  While Bob's offer is a significant increase from his previous one, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **John's offer is secure:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay my minimum. This gives me the luxury of being patient and trying to secure a higher price from Bob.
* **Room for further negotiation:** I have several rounds left. There's still potential to push Bob higher, especially as he's shown a willingness to compromise.
