"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe holds significant value for you. I've carefully assessed its worth, and given its potential impact, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We're beginning with a strong offer close to Bob's maximum perceived value. This establishes a firm stance and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies the product's value without revealing our own minimum.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting high, we anticipate a counteroffer and leave space to reach a mutually beneficial agreement within the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in your product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good offer, we're still in the early stages of negotiation. Bob's counteroffer indicates he's willing to pay a significant sum, suggesting there's room to push for a higher price. We'll counter with a price closer to our desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've considered your offer, and I'm willing to move slightly from my initial price. Let's meet in the middle at $1,300,000. This reflects the true value of the product and ensures a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise, but Hold Firm:** We're showing flexibility by moving from our initial price, but not drastically. The $100,000 decrease signals willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a strong profit.
* **Justification:** Highlighting ""true value"" reinforces the product's worth and subtly anchors the negotiation closer to our desired price. 
* **Call to Action:** ""Meet in the middle"" encourages Bob to accept this offer as a balanced solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,300,000 is getting closer, but I'm still at $1,250,000. This reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly interested and negotiating in good faith. However, the increments are getting smaller.  While $1,250,000 is tempting, we're not at a point of diminishing returns yet.  We'll push a bit further, but with a smaller counteroffer, signaling we're getting closer to our limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value this product offers.  I appreciate your willingness to find common ground.  How about we settle at $1,275,000? This feels like a fair compromise that benefits us both."", 
""product_price"": 1275000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Increment:** We're now down to a $25,000 decrease, signaling we're reaching the upper limit of our flexibility. 
* **Emphasis on Fairness and Compromise:** We're reiterating these points to encourage Bob to meet us halfway.
* **Direct Proposal:**  By directly suggesting the $1,275,000, we're presenting it as a strong and reasonable solution."
