{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's higher than Bob's valuation of $12,000, giving him some room to negotiate. It's also lower than your minimum valuation of $15,000, leaving some room for you to earn a profit while still potentially securing a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Could you do $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low, even though it's within his valuation. It's important to remember that your minimum valuation is $15,000, and selling to John for that price is always a guarantee.  By rejecting Bob's offer, you can continue negotiating and potentially get a better price from him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $10,000 is a good starting point, it's a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  Let's split the difference.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $13,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $11,000.  Would you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is closer to your minimum valuation, it's still a significant drop from your ideal selling price.  You can likely get closer to your desired price by continuing negotiations, especially since Bob has shown a willingness to compromise. Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're aiming for $11,000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a good value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
