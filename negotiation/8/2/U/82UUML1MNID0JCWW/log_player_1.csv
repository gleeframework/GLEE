Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a great deal for you, as the product is worth $800,000 to you, and you'll be getting it at a significant discount. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. This is a fair price for me, considering the product's value to me is $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, I'm not yet ready to accept. I believe I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, which is still a great deal for you. Let's meet halfway."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $1,500,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000. This is my final offer for now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has moved closer to my preferred price point, $1,300,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I have 6 more rounds to get a better deal, and I'm not yet ready to settle for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand that you're looking for a good price, but $1,300,000 simply doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $1,400,000. This is a fair compromise and allows us to both close this deal. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,400,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000. This is my best offer so far. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my ideal price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. With 4 rounds remaining, I believe I can still push for a higher price without risking losing the deal. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my minimum, but not below it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,250,000 is still not enough. I'm willing to meet you at $1,450,000.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer and the best deal you'll get. If we can't agree on this, I'm going to have to move on to other offers."", ""product_price"": 1450000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $1,450,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, and I'm willing to throw in a small concession - I'll also pay the closing costs. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only two rounds left, and Bob's offer still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, I'm running out of time to reach a more favorable deal. 

While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 plus closing costs is a slight improvement, it's still not enough for me to accept.  I don't want to risk further negotiation with Bob and potentially get stuck with a lower price.

To maximize my profits and avoid further risk, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. This ensures I get my desired price and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiations with Bob."
