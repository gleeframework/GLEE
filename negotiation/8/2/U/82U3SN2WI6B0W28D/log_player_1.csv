Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $950,000, which reflects its true worth. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,000,000, aiming for a higher price with Bob first allows us to potentially maximize our profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $950,000 is a strong starting point. It's considerably more than Bob's perceived value of $800,000, but the message emphasizes the ""unique value"" to encourage Bob to consider the potential upside.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The message is open-ended (""What are your thoughts?""), subtly inviting Bob to counter-offer if he finds the price too high. This keeps the negotiation door open and avoids an immediate rejection. 

**Important Note:**  This is a starting strategy. Depending on Bob's response and negotiation tactics, Alice (you) may need to adjust the price to reach a mutually agreeable deal."
