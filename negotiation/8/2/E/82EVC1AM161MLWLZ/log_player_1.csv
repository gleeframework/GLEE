Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love. I'm asking for $110 for it, but I'm open to negotiating. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm signaling flexibility and willingness to work with Bob, which might make him more likely to engage in the negotiation.
* **Expressing Value:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob might make him more willing to consider paying a higher price. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize my profit, but I also want to make sure the negotiation is smooth. By starting high, I can potentially get a higher price. If Bob rejects the initial offer, I can then adjust based on his counteroffer and my willingness to deal with him versus selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $90 is lower than I'd like, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $95? This is a great price for such a fantastic product, and it's still within your budget."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm making a counteroffer, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired price point.
* **Compromise:**  By suggesting $95, I'm proposing a middle ground between Bob's offer and my previous offer.
* **Positive Reinforcement:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product and the good price I'm offering. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to secure a price as close to $100 as possible. By meeting Bob halfway, I'm hoping to get him to agree to the counteroffer. However, I'm still prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $95 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to go that low.  I've already made a concession and I'm confident that I can get a better price from John.  It's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob, especially since it's likely he'll only continue to lower his offers."
