"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'll really love it. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Testing the waters:**  This price gives Bob a clear indication that I'm serious about getting a good price. 
* **Positive language:** I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I'm interested in purchasing it for $95. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $95 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Room for negotiation:** I still have time to negotiate with Bob. 
* **John is a backup:**  John offers a guaranteed $100, but I'm willing to take a risk with Bob in hopes of getting a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105. This still gives you a great price and allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within range:**  $105 is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. 
* **Highlighting value:**  I emphasize the ""great price"" Bob is getting, appealing to his desire for a good deal. 
* **Show flexibility:**  I've shown I'm willing to negotiate by lowering my price, while still being firm on my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your price. I appreciate it. I would like to propose $100 as my final offer for the product. I hope this meets your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** Bob's offer of $100 is my minimum acceptable price.
* **No further gain:** There's no guarantee I can get a higher price from Bob, and further negotiation might risk him backing out entirely.
* **Time pressure:** With only 6 rounds remaining, it's wise to secure the deal at this point. 

While I could potentially try to push for a slightly higher price, the risk of losing Bob as a buyer is not worth the small potential gain. Accepting the $100 offer ensures I get my minimum and close the deal."
