"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be a great fit for your needs. I'm asking for $12,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider selling it for $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,000 is simply too low. Considering the value this product offers, I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This price is still a good deal for you, and it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can make this work.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you be open to $7,500? That would be a great price for both of us, I think.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $7,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good outcome. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
