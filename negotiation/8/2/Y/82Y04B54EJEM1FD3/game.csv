"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've already invested a lot in this product and I'm not willing to go as low as $15000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $17000. This is the best price I can offer for now.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $16000, but I need to add a small buffer. I'm counteroffering at $16500. This is my final offer for now.",16500.0,Alice,5,

"I've made several concessions already, Bob, and I'm starting to get concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one final offer. I'll sell the product to you for $16300, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",16300.0,Alice,9,
