"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,050,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something worth a million dollars to you for a modest premium. If you decline, I'll be selling it to John for $1,000,000, so you're getting a chance to secure it for a slightly higher price. Let me know your decision.",1050000.0,Alice,1,
