Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'll meet you at $1,550,000, which is as high as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to budge, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1,200,000.

While selling to John guarantees $1,500,000, accepting Bob's offer of $1,550,000 nets an extra $50,000. It's unlikely Bob will go higher, and risking further negotiation might lead to him backing out entirely."
