"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial price.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your perspective on the market value. However, the product's intrinsic value and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This offer reflects a more accurate valuation of its long-term benefits.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,700,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and the potential benefits of the product. I'm open to further negotiations to find a mutually beneficial price.",1700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be frank, my absolute floor for this product is $1,600,000.  This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer. I believe it's more than fair considering the value you'll gain.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $1,600,000 is your absolute floor, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more offer. I'll meet you at $1,550,000, which is as high as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to budge, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1,200,000.",1550000.0,Bob,6,
