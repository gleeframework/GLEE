"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm offering it to you for $11,500.  It's a great deal, and I know you'll be happy with it. What do you say?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $10,250? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with the product.  Let me know what you think.",10250.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're firm on the price, Alice, but I'm on a tight budget.  Could you do $9,500? That's the highest I can go.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're really trying to get the best deal, and I respect that.  I'm willing to go a bit lower, but $9,500 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?  That's my final offer. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,5,
