,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $18000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $14000 for the product. I'm confident that we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm afraid $14000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, so I'll counteroffer at $16000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to compromise, Alice, but $16000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $15500. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. Can you consider this offer?",15500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $15500 is enough for me to let go of the product. I'm willing to meet you at $16200, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I believe this price reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise.",16200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to meet me at $16200, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $15800, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this offer?",15800.0,Bob,6,
