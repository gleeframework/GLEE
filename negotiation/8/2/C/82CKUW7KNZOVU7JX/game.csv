"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for some profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and still allows you a decent profit margin. Let's find a middle ground.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,100,000? This would be a good compromise and allow us to close the deal. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
