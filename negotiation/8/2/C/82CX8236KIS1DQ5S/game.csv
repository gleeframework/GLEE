"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from the deal.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11800. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business. I'm confident you'll find it's a worthwhile investment.",11800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value this product, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $10500.  Let's meet in the middle at $11150.  This will give you a good profit while remaining within my budget.",11150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still a bit far from the price I was thinking. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose $12300. This is the lowest price I can go, considering the product's value and my target profit margin.",12300.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $12300 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $11500. This would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still make a good profit on the sale.",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I can do $12000, but that's as low as I can go. If we can agree on this price, I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",12000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm ready to close the deal.  How about $11750?  This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit and me to stay within budget.",11750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm starting to think we're getting too close to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm not giving away too much value. I can do $12200, but that's as low as I can go. If we can agree on this price, I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",12200.0,Alice,9,
