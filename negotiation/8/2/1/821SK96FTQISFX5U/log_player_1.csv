{""message"": ""Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you this incredible product! It's worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset. My starting price is $1,200,000. Let's discuss and see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than what I'm hoping to get.  I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to my initial asking price. How about $1,100,000? This gives us both a good deal and allows me to recoup some of the value I placed on this product."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1050000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer.  $1,050,000 is a good compromise and a significant improvement over his previous offer.  While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, it's getting late in the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
