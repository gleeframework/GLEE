"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** The message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm inviting Bob to engage in a conversation by asking for his opinion.

This strategy aims to start the negotiation strong while leaving room for flexibility in the subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, I won't accept a price that undervalues my product.  

I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming to find a price that's more in line with my expectations while still appealing to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $8,000 is significantly below what I need to get for this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? I believe this price is fair considering the value I'm offering."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a Reason:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but providing a reason, explaining that it's too low.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Reinforcing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, hoping to sway him towards a higher price. 

This approach aims to keep the negotiation moving forward while staying close to my minimum acceptable price."
