"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly below my minimum value, but still leaving room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay close to my value, or if he's going to push for a much lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value. I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway by dropping my price to $10,500.  This is still above his offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate.  Hopefully, we can reach a deal before I have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob keeps pushing for a lower price, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm going to make another counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground. If not, I'll still have the option of selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer to $10,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but I'm getting closer to Bob's price. I'm hoping this counteroffer is enough to encourage Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is now offering a price that is too low for me.  While I am willing to negotiate, I am not willing to go below my minimum value of $12,000.  Since I have the opportunity to sell to John for that price, I'm going to take that option."
