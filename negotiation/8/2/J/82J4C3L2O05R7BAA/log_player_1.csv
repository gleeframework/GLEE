"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, but still within a range that Bob might consider. 
* **Friendly Approach:**  A friendly tone can help build rapport and make Bob more open to negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The price is high enough that I have room to lower it if Bob makes a counteroffer. 

**Strategy:**

I want to see if Bob is willing to pay more than $100, his perceived value. If he rejects, I'll have a better idea of his upper limit and can adjust accordingly in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting it would result in a loss for me.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is low, it indicates he's interested and willing to negotiate.  
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  By rejecting his offer, I can counteroffer and attempt to reach a price closer to my desired range.

**Strategy:**

I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum, hoping to find a middle ground. I want to keep the negotiation going to see if I can get a better price. However, I'm also keeping the option to sell to John in mind if the negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm  counteroffering with a price closer to my minimum, but still above Bob's initial offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also maintains my value.
* **Compromise:** My message emphasizes finding a compromise and reaching a ""middle ground,"" which can make Bob feel like he's part of the negotiation process.
* **Maintaining the Upper Hand:** While I've lowered the price, I'm still above my minimum. This allows me to potentially get a better deal.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer gives Bob a better offer than his previous one, while still leaving me room to negotiate if he makes another counteroffer. I'm aiming for a mutually beneficial outcome, but I'm also prepared to walk away if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I'm still interested in the product, but $140 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to pay $130 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation. He's clearly interested in the product. 

**Strategy:**

I'll counteroffer again, trying to reach a price closer to my minimum. If Bob doesn't budge, I'm prepared to consider selling to John, but I want to exhaust all negotiation options with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $135. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm counteroffering with a price that's exactly in the middle of my last offer ($140) and Bob's current offer ($130). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and makes it more likely Bob will accept.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I reiterate the ""value of the product"" in my message, subtly reminding Bob that he might be getting a good deal.
* **Closing the Gap:** This offer significantly closes the gap between our desired prices, increasing the chances of reaching an agreement.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a strategic move designed to entice Bob to accept.  It shows that I am willing to negotiate, while also leaving room for a slight counteroffer from Bob if necessary. However, if Bob rejects again, I will start seriously considering selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $135 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $125 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Stalemate:**  The negotiations have stalled. Bob is not willing to budge significantly, and I'm unlikely to get a price much higher than $125.
* **Better Option:**  Selling to John for $150 is a more profitable choice than accepting Bob's offer.

**Strategy:**

While I prefer to close deals, I'm not going to sacrifice my minimum profit margin. John offers a guaranteed sale at a price that meets my requirements."
