"Alice's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us. While $750,000 is still below my desired outcome, I'm willing to accept $875,000 as my final offer. This is a significant reduction and reflects my willingness to make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $875,000.  It's better to secure the product from John at $800,000 and avoid further negotiation."
