"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, the product's value is significantly higher than your proposed price. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This offer reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us. While $750,000 is still below my desired outcome, I'm willing to accept $875,000 as my final offer. This is a significant reduction and reflects my willingness to make a deal.",875000.0,Alice,5,
