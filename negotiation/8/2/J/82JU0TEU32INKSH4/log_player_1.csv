Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to make a deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're getting more than your minimum of $80.
* **It's below Bob's value:** Bob is willing to pay $150, so he has room to negotiate.
* **It's a fair starting point:**  A 20% discount from Bob's value is reasonable.

This strategy aims to quickly find a price that benefits both parties while leaving room for negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $90 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than your minimum of $80, you can likely do better.  You have a few things working in your favor:

* **Bob is interested:** He's willing to negotiate, so you can try to push for a higher price.
* **The product is worth more to him:** There's room to increase the price without making it unreasonable.
* **John is a backup:** If negotiations with Bob fall through, you have a guaranteed sale with John.

**Next Steps:**

You should counteroffer Bob with a price higher than $90 but lower than your initial offer of $120. This shows flexibility while trying to maximize your profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a little low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $105?  I'm open to discussing further, but I don't want to go lower than that."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer:

* **Is higher than Bob's offer:**  This shows you're willing to negotiate but not give away the product too cheaply.
* **Is lower than your previous offer:** This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Offers a clear price point:** This makes it easier for Bob to understand your position and respond accordingly.

By meeting in the middle, you're showing a willingness to reach a deal while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed. This strategy aims to find a price that works for both of you."
