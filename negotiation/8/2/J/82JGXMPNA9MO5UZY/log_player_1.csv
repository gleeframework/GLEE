Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. Given its value, I'm asking for $10,000. I believe this is a fair price considering what you'll gain from it."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the price (""given its value"", ""what you'll gain"") can make the offer seem more reasonable.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $10,000, Alice signals that she's willing to negotiate but still aims to get a price significantly above her minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I'm only able to pay up to $8,000 for it. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches our minimum acceptable price, there's still room for negotiation.  We'll try to push for a slightly higher amount before accepting his offer or going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. Would you consider meeting me halfway at $9,000?"", 
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By suggesting a price halfway between the initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, we're demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Maintaining Profit:** $9,000 is still a significant profit margin above our minimum of $8,000. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer helps gauge how much Bob is willing to pay and if further negotiation is worthwhile."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I am still unable to meet you at $9,000. I am sticking to my original offer of $8,000. Is there any way we could come to an agreement? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is firm:** Bob has reiterated his initial offer of $8,000 twice. This suggests he's unlikely to go higher. 
* **Meeting our minimum:** While we could try to negotiate further, there's a risk of losing the sale altogether. Accepting his offer guarantees we sell the product at our minimum acceptable price.
* **John as backup:**  It's always good to have a backup plan.  Knowing we can sell to John for $8,000 provides a safety net. However, since Bob is already matching that price, it's more efficient to close the deal with him now."
