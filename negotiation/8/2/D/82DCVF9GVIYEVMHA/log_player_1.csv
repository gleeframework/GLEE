Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($150) as possible without scaring him off.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While $130 is a strong starting point, it leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Time Value & Alternative Buyer:**  Mentioning listing it publicly implies demand and a potential loss of opportunity for Bob. Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $100 provides a safety net."
