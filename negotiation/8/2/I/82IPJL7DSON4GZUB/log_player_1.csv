Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a higher price than my minimum, hoping to capitalize on Bob's potential need for the product. 

However, I need more information to make a more strategic decision. 

For example, I need to know:

* **How much does Bob need this product?** If it's essential to him, he might be willing to pay a premium.
* **What's Bob's financial situation?** Can he afford a high price?
* **How much time do I have to negotiate?**  If I'm under pressure, I might have to accept a lower offer. 

The more information I have, the better I can tailor my offer to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While I want to maximize my profit, I'm not desperate to sell. 

I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.  I will counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's current offer. This gives me the chance to negotiate and potentially secure a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,300,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer. I believe it's a reasonable compromise that might appeal to Bob while still ensuring I get a decent price. 

I'm hoping to find a middle ground where both of us can be satisfied.  This approach balances my desire for a high price with the need to keep the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low for me. I'm not willing to go any lower than my minimum price of $1,200,000.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John, I'll choose to sell to him and secure a price that meets my minimum requirement.  

While I'd prefer to get a higher price, selling to John ensures I don't lose out on significant value.  It's important to recognize when a negotiation is not going in my favor and make a decision that protects my financial interests."
