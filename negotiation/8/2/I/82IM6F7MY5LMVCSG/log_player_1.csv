Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so he's likely to consider this offer.
* **It's below your minimum:**  You value the product at $1,200,000, so this offer gives you some room to negotiate.
* **It leaves space for counteroffers:** This gives Bob a chance to make a counteroffer while still allowing you to potentially reach a price you're comfortable with.

**Important:**  It's vital to consider the dynamics of the negotiation.  If Bob is a strong negotiator and you think he might be willing to go higher, you could offer a slightly higher price, like $1,175,000. However, if you believe he's more likely to reject a higher offer, sticking to $1,150,000 might be more strategic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly below your minimum value of $1,200,000.  Accepting it would result in a significant loss for you.  While selling to John for $1,200,000 is a safe option, there's still room to negotiate with Bob and potentially get closer to your desired price. 

Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to counter-offer and try to find a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Moving closer to Bob:**  This counteroffer is a compromise, moving halfway between your previous offer of $1,150,000 and Bob's offer of $900,000.
* **Still above Bob's value:** This price is still above Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000, making it more appealing than your previous offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** There's still some wiggle room to negotiate further, potentially reaching a price closer to your minimum of $1,200,000. 

This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a reasonable profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is getting closer to your minimum, it's still significantly below your desired price.  Selling to John for $1,200,000 is tempting, but there's still a chance to negotiate a better price with Bob.  By rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer, you can try to push the price higher without losing the opportunity to potentially get a more profitable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This counteroffer is a direct compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his last offer of $950,000 and your previous offer of $1,050,000.
* **Testing the waters:** This price is close to Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000, making it a strong test to see if he's willing to meet your minimum.
* **Minimizing risk:**  If Bob rejects this offer, you can move to sell to John for $1,200,000, which is still a profitable option.  However, there's a chance Bob will accept this offer, allowing you to reach a deal without sacrificing too much of your potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $980,000 is getting closer to your minimum, but it's still $20,000 below it.  At this point, it's getting risky to continue negotiating with Bob. He might be willing to go higher, but he might also be using this as a tactic to push you down further.

Selling to John for $1,200,000 guarantees you your minimum desired value and eliminates the risk of further negotiation.  While it's not the ideal outcome, it's a safe and profitable way to end the negotiation."
