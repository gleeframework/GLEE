"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me. Could you do $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,1050000.0
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This is my best price for now, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair offer.",1050000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price.  To be honest, $1,050,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle at $975,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I'm willing to make it work if we can agree on this price.",975000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,1010000.0
"I understand that $975,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can meet you at $1,010,000, which is a compromise that I'm comfortable with. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can agree on this price.",1010000.0,Alice,5,,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but honestly, at $1,010,000, I might as well buy from John. He's offering the same product for $1,200,000, and while I prefer to work with you, the price difference is becoming too significant to ignore. To make this work, I need you to come down a bit more. How about $990,000? That's my final offer.",990000.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,1005000.0
"Bob, I understand that you're considering John's offer, and I don't want to lose the sale. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $990,000. I can meet you at $1,005,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm hoping you'll see the value in this product and be willing to make the investment.",1005000.0,Alice,7,,
