"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit though. How about $12,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $12,500 is still a little steep for me, though.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,250?",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm open to further negotiation but $11,250 isn't quite there yet. Let's split the difference. How about $11,875? It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you won't regret it. ",11875.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $11,000. Would you be willing to meet me there, at $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're aiming for a lower price, but $11,500 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with. How about $11,625? That's a small step closer to your goal, and I'm confident it's a fair deal.  Let me know what you think.",11625.0,Alice,7,
