Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to get a good price, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,275,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your last offer and my previous offer, so I'll make a counteroffer of $1,225,000. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000

``` 

While getting $1,275,000 would be ideal, Bob seems firm on his final offer. Accepting his offer of $1,225,000 is a better outcome than potentially reaching no deal and having to sell to John for $1,200,000."
