"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product for you. I'm offering it for $100.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing that Bob might counteroffer.  This gives me room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than my minimum, I think I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Okay Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $95?  It's still a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be very happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $95. It's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement this round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Can you meet me at $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $92 is still a good deal for me.  The negotiation has gone on for a few rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely."
