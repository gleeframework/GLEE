{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good deal, I can aim for a better price.  I'm confident I can negotiate a lower price within the 10 rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down to $120, but I'm really hoping to get it for closer to my budget. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is better than Alice's initial offer, I'm still hoping to get the price down a bit more. I'm confident I can negotiate a price closer to my budget within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget.  I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. I'm confident this price works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $112. This is as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has indicated that $112 is her minimum price.  While I could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely I'll get a significantly lower price from Alice.  At this point, buying from Alice for $112 is a better deal than buying from John for $100.  I'm also running out of rounds, so it's safer to accept the offer."
