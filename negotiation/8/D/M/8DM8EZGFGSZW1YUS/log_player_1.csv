"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $11,500 is a little too high for me.  Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I'm motivated to sell,  $9,000 is significantly below my minimum threshold. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $10,500 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,750 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with the price.  I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round.  I'm hoping he'll recognize the value of the product and come closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,250.  This is a fair compromise that takes into account both our needs.  Let's aim to close this deal in the next round!"", ""product_price"": 10250}

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I would prefer to sell for more, Bob has offered my minimum price.  I don't want to risk losing the deal and being forced to sell to John for less than what I would make from Bob."
