"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $15,000. This is a bold move, but I believe it's important to set a high initial price to maximize my potential profit. I'm hoping Bob values the product highly enough to be willing to negotiate. If not, I can always fall back on John's offer of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I still believe there's room for negotiation. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $13,500. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaves room for profit. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to accept it yet. I still believe I can get a slightly better price, especially since I have a guaranteed backup offer from John. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway this round by offering $12,500. This is a significant concession, but I'm still earning more than my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be appealing enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is getting increasingly unwilling to negotiate, and his offer is now below my minimum acceptable price.  It's time to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $12,000.  It's not ideal, but it's a guaranteed sale and ensures I meet my minimum profit goal."
