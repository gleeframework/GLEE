Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

This is my initial offer to Bob. I'm aiming for a price that is significantly higher than my minimum value of $15,000.  This will give me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.  I'm also hoping that Bob is interested in the product enough to make a counteroffer, allowing us to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but I'm still willing to negotiate.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price of $20,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 19000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with $19,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and his counteroffer. It's still above my minimum value, but it shows flexibility and willingness to meet him halfway. I'm hoping this will encourage him to accept the offer and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, and the negotiation is taking time. I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid further negotiation and ensure a sale.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good profit."
