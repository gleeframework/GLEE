**Reasoning:**

* **Time Constraint:** We're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds.
* **Minimal Difference:** The difference between Alice's offer ($1,020,000) and our ideal price ($1,000,000) is quite small.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate has the risk of Alice not budging and us being forced to either take her final offer or buy from John at a much higher price.

It's unlikely we'll get a significantly better deal in the remaining rounds, and risking John's $1,500,000 price isn't worth the relatively small potential savings."
