I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer.  Since Alice's first offer was significantly lower than my maximum, I'm trying to gauge her willingness to negotiate and see how much she's willing to move."

Alice is coming down a bit, but it's still a bit too high. I'm going to continue to try and negotiate a lower price before considering buying from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer of $7,700 is close enough to my desired price that I'm willing to accept it. I've saved a significant amount of money compared to buying from John, and I still have a few rounds left if I need to make a counteroffer."
