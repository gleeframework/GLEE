"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is tailored to meet your specific needs. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth every penny. Considering its high quality and the benefits it offers, I am offering it to you for $14000. This price reflects both the value it holds for you and the opportunity to secure such a valuable asset at a competitive rate. Please let me know if this offer meets your expectations or if you have any further questions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Maximum:** Bob is willing to spend a maximum of $15,000.
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice offers the product for $14,000.
* **John's Price:** John is selling the same product for $15,000.

Since Alice's offer is lower than John's price, Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can still get the product for less than his maximum from John."
