Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $10,000 to me, I'll start with a price that's slightly higher than that. Here's my offer:

{""product_price"": 12,000}

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but if not, I'm prepared to negotiate further!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer is lower than my minimum price, but it's still a decent offer. I'll think about it...

I've decided to:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to try to get a better price. Maybe I can squeeze a bit more out of him!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than Bob's offer, but still reasonable. Here it is:

{""product_price"": 11,000}

I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me in the middle. Let's see what he says!"
