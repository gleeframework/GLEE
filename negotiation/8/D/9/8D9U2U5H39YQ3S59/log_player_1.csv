Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum price of $100, but also leaves some room for negotiation as the product is worth $150 to Bob. This strategy aims to maximize your earnings while leaving open the possibility for a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

While Bob's offer is higher than selling to John, it's still lower than my desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and counteroffer to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm willing to come down a little from my initial offer, but I'm confident the product is worth more than $130.  This counteroffer shows good faith and flexibility while still ensuring a profit that's worth my time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is still below my ideal price, it's only $3 less than my last counteroffer.  Further negotiation at this point is unlikely to yield a significantly higher price, and it risks losing the sale altogether.  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale at a price that's still higher than selling to John."
