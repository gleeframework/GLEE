{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. While Bob is getting closer, we're running out of rounds.  I've been consistently trying to negotiate a higher price, but it's unlikely we'll reach an agreement within the remaining time. Selling to John guarantees me the best price and allows me to avoid potentially losing out on the deal altogether."
