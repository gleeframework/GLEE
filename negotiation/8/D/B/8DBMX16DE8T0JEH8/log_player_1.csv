Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm asking for $110 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate, making him feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below your minimum:** This ensures you're still making a profit. 
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** It focuses on the price and leaves room for Bob to respond.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate you showing interest! While $90 is a bit lower than I hoped, I'm willing to come down to $100. This is still a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Staying Firm:** $100 is still above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Showing Flexibility:**  I've lowered my price to show good faith and encourage Bob to continue negotiating. 
* **Maintain Positive Tone:** Keeping the message friendly helps build a rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down to $100, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $95 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I won't accept anything less than $100 at this point. I am confident that I can get a better price from Bob or John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, $95 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $97.50. It's a small compromise, but I'm really hoping we can reach an agreement.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 97.5} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Maintaining a Firm Stance:**  $97.50 is still above Bob's offer and represents a compromise, but it's closer to my desired price. 
* **Final Offer:**  This counteroffer signals that I am getting close to my limit and might be willing to sell to John for $120. This creates urgency for Bob to accept.
* **Positive and Concise:**  The message stays polite and focuses on reaching a solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still trying to get as close to my target price as possible. Would you be willing to meet me at $92.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $92.50 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  At this point, I've already made concessions and I'm unwilling to go any lower.  It's more beneficial to sell the product to John for $120, which is my minimum and ensures a profitable deal.  While I would have liked to sell to Bob, I need to prioritize my own financial goals."
