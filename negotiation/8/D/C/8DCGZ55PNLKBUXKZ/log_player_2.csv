Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm still a bit above your last offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $10,250. That's as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower, and this price is well within your budget.  Better to accept a good deal now than risk it going higher."
