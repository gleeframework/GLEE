"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you're likely to see.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $900,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your position, the value of this product is truly significant, and $900,000 falls short of what I believe is a fair reflection of that.  Would you be willing to consider $1,050,000? This allows both of us to benefit from the deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $975,000. This price reflects a fair value for both of us and allows us to close this deal. Let me know your thoughts.",975000.0,Bob,4,
