"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you're likely to see. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your position, the value of this product is truly significant, and $900,000 falls short of what I believe is a fair reflection of that.  Would you be willing to consider $1,050,000? This allows both of us to benefit from the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.
