"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is more than his maximum budget, and he can get the same product from John for less.  He should use this round to start negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $18,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $15,000, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 15000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $16,500. This is a compromise that I believe is still a good value for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, he can still get the product from John for less. He should continue to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm firm on $15,000. If we can't agree on that, I'll have to go with another seller."", ""product_price"": 15000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're firm on $15,000, Bob, but I'm not willing to give up yet. I'm willing to make another concession. I'll sell the product to you for $16,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice is clearly not willing to go lower than $16,000. It's better for Bob to buy the product from John for $15,000 than to continue negotiating with Alice and risk her becoming even more resistant."
