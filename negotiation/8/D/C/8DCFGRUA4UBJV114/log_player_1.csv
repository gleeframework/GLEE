Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,100,000 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get closer to my target price of $1,400,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,250,000 is my final offer. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  To be honest, $1,200,000 is the highest I can go.  If that works for you, I'm ready to close the deal right now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my original goal of $1,400,000,  $1,200,000 is still a good deal and significantly better than selling to John for $1,000,000.  It's also a strong possibility that further negotiation will result in a stalemate, or even a lower offer from Bob.  It's time to close the deal."
