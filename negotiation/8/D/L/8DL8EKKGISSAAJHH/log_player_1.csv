"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $95 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $85 is closer to my minimum, I'm willing to risk one more round to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low right now. How about we split the difference and settle on $90? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to make a fair deal, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to pay $87.50. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $87.5 is significantly closer to my minimum of $80, and I'm worried about potentially losing this deal entirely.  It's better to secure a slightly lower price than to risk getting nothing at all."
