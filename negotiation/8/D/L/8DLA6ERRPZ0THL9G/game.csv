"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $9,500 for the product. I believe this price reflects its value while allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I understand your perspective, but I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This offer still gives you a great deal, and it allows me to fairly compensate for the value of the product.  Let's see if we can make this work.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. While $11,000 is closer than previous offers, I still feel it's slightly above the product's fair market value. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,500. This price aligns more closely with what I believe the product is worth, while still being a reasonable profit margin for you. I hope this helps us reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. I'm happy to meet you halfway.  I'm willing to come down to $10,750. This is my final offer, and I hope it allows us to reach an agreement.  I believe this price reflects the product's value and provides a fair return for me.  What do you say?",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with $10,500. This price is a compromise that respects both the product's value and your desire for a fair return. I believe this could be a win-win situation for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,6,
