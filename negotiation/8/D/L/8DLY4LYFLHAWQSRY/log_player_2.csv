{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth no more than $10,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is significantly higher. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```

Bob is aiming for a significant price reduction, offering $8,000, which is still within his budget but a much lower starting point for negotiation."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's maximum value for the product. He should continue negotiating to try and get a better price."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's limit, it's still above his maximum value. He should continue negotiating to see if he can get a better deal. There's still room for negotiation and he might be able to get a price closer to his target of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. There's not much room left, but with only a few rounds remaining, a counteroffer could still lead to a better deal.  He's already invested time and effort in the negotiation, so it makes sense to try for one more round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

Bob is going for his maximum value, offering $10,000.  This is his final offer, as he's unwilling to pay more. If Alice doesn't accept, he'll move on to John and buy the product from him. This is his last chance to close the deal with Alice at his desired price."
