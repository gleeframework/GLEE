Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You want at least $80, so $100 is a solid starting point.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** $100 is significantly less than what Bob values the product, so he has room to counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **It shows confidence:** You're not giving it away cheaply, demonstrating you believe in the value of your product. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I am willing to pay $90 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is a good price, it's still below the midpoint of your desired price ($100) and Bob's perceived value ($120). There's still potential to gain a better deal, and you can leverage the fact that Bob already demonstrated his interest in the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest! I can come down a bit to $95. This is still a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll find it to be a great value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meet him halfway:** You've moved closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Maintain a bit of leverage:**  $95 is still above Bob's offer, suggesting there's room for further negotiation if he's unwilling to budge. 
* **Keep the conversation positive:** Your message reaffirms your willingness to work with Bob and emphasizes the value of the product."
