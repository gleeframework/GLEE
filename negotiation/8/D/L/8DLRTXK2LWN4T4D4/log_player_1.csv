Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a limited offer, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aim for the highest price Bob might reasonably accept, maximizing your profit over your guaranteed sale to John.
* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, giving you room to negotiate above John's offer.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested buyers"" might encourage Bob to act quickly. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves a small margin for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a still very profitable deal for you."
