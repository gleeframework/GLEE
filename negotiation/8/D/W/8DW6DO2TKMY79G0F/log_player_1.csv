"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  This price reflects the value I place on the product while also leaving room for negotiation. I'll assess Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, but I'm still aiming higher.  I believe I can get a better price.  By rejecting his offer, I can counter with a price closer to my desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves room for further negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is the same as his previous offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, it's becoming clear that Bob isn't willing to go higher.  To avoid risking a further decrease in price, I'll accept his offer and secure the $1,200,000. It's a good profit, and I don't want to risk losing out entirely by pushing for more."
