"Alice, your offer is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is my best offer, let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $950,000?  It's a good price for both of us and allows us to move forward.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is still outside my budget. I'm ready to pay $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach an agreement. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $925,000.  This is a good compromise for both of us, and hopefully, we can finally close this deal.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $925,000 is still a little more than I can afford right now.  I'm willing to go up to $910,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",910000.0,Bob,6,
