"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, the value of this product is significantly higher than your proposed price, especially given its unique features that I think you'll find particularly beneficial.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,100,000. This is a very competitive offer for a product of this caliber.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price.
