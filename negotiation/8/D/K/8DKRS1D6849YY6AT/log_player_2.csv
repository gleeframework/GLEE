"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm open to negotiations, but I need to make a starting point. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $18,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer the product to you for $16,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my price, but I'm still not convinced that $11,500 is sufficient. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $16,000 and $11,500, which would be $13,750. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair compromise given the value of the product.
