"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you might be interested in. It's worth at least $100 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $90.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

You should reject Alice's offer.  While $90 is less than what it's worth to Alice, you know you can get the product for $80 from John."
