To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is simply out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential. I've already received interest from other parties willing to pay a premium.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,500,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This reflects the value of the product to me while also being a fair price.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

We're still significantly below my fallback option of John. Bob is incrementing his offers slowly, so I'll keep applying pressure."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need you to meet me closer to my valuation.  The product offers significant long-term value, and $1,100,000 doesn't reflect that.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is my final offer."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to get closer to your valuation, but $1,400,000 is still too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

Bob has finally offered more than my fallback option with John. Taking this deal is a no-brainer."
