"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe I can't justify spending $20,000 on it at this time. Would you consider lowering the price to $15,000?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  Could you do $18,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and provide substantial value.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your response. I've carefully considered your proposal and I'm still not convinced that $18,000 is the right price for me. I'd like to propose $16,000 as a counteroffer. I hope this aligns better with your valuation of the product.",16000.0,Bob,4,
