Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $9,500 is too low for me, and I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'm going to see if I can negotiate a higher price with Bob before I consider selling to John."
