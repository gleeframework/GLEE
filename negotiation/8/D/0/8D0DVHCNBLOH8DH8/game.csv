"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which I think is a fair compromise. Let's work together to find a price that's acceptable to both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still not comfortable with $10,500. I'd be willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,250. I think that's a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but I'm still not at a price that works for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,400.  This is a fair price that's close to both of our target points. Let's close the deal.",10400.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, I'm still not comfortable with $10,400. I'd be willing to meet you at $10,300. I think that's the best we can do, considering the product's value to me.",10300.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,300. I'm willing to come down to $10,350 as a final compromise. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's close this deal.",10350.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down to $10,350, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you at $10,300, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to consider buying from John for $10,000.",10300.0,Bob,8,
