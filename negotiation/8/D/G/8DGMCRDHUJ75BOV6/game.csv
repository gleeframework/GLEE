"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to offer it to you at a price of $800,000. This is a great opportunity to get an incredible deal, and I believe you won't find a better offer anywhere else.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $800,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value and my budget. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering its value and your budget, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get the product at a reasonable price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product, which is closer to my budget and a fair price considering its value. I'm confident this is a win-win for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than my previous offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's value.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
