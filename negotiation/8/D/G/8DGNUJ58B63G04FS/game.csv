"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,900,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product, given its value to me.  I believe this is a fair price considering the potential we both see in it. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $1,900,000 represents its full potential, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. I believe this price point makes it a very attractive acquisition for you.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,700,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still unable to go that high. I'm prepared to offer $1,400,000 for the product. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in it. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
