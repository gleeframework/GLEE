{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than John's price, there's still room for negotiation to get a better deal.  By rejecting, Bob can make a counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to Alice's minimum acceptable value."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $1,300,000 is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer. It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation as it's still higher than Alice's minimum value and leaves room for further negotiation. This strategy aims to pressure Alice to lower her price without immediately resorting to John's offer."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above the value he is willing to pay. There is still potential to negotiate further.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal. It also avoids committing to a price that is still too high."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $1,350,000 is a slight increase from his previous offer, but still significantly lower than Alice's current offer. This move shows Alice that Bob is serious about getting a good deal but also willing to compromise. It aims to encourage Alice to meet Bob halfway and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
