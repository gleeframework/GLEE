"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm starting with a price of $95. This is a reasonable starting point, considering the product is worth $80 to Bob.  I'm hoping to get a price closer to my minimum of $80, but I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $75 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm offering $85. This is a compromise, as it's halfway between my minimum of $80 and Bob's offer of $75. I'm hoping he'll see this as a fair price and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum. I will accept this offer as there is no chance of getting a better price in the remaining rounds."
