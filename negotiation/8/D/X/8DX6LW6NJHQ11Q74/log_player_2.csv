"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $12000 to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $10,000.  While it's a good deal, he can likely negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to split the difference between his maximum price ($12,000) and Alice's desired price ($10,000). This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $9000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9500. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you. Let's try to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,500, which is a good price for Bob. He can save $2,500 compared to buying from John. While he might be able to negotiate a bit further, the risk of losing the deal to John is not worth the potential savings of a few hundred dollars."
