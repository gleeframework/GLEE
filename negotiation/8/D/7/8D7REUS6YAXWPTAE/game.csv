"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I am looking to keep my budget under $15000. I would like to propose an offer of $8500 for the product.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. I'm thinking of a price between $9500 and $10000. How about we meet in the middle at $9750? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value.",9750.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad you're willing to stay within your budget. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $9250. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9750 and $9250, which would be $9500. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value.",9500.0,Alice,5,
