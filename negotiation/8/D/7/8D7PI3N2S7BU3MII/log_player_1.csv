Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, meaning he wouldn't rationally pay more.
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999. 

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your profit, but not so high that Bob walks away.  

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** $1,450,000 leaves room for negotiation while staying close to your ideal outcome.
* **Justification:**  The message uses phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value"" to subtly anchor the product's worth in Bob's mind.

**Important Notes**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You'll need to decide how low you're willing to go before walking away and selling to John.
* **Information is Key:**  In a real negotiation, gathering more information about Bob's needs and constraints would allow for a more tailored approach."
