Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product before I list it publicly. I think it would be particularly valuable to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $110."", 
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  We know Bob values the product at $120. 
* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $80 from John, so anything above that is profit.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $110 gives Bob a small discount (saving him $10) and allows you to maximize your profit, earning $30 more than selling to John.

This strategy aims to make the offer attractive to Bob while still securing a significant profit for yourself."
