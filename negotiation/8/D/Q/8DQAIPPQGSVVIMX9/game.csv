"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and potential. Can you consider this counteroffer?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  To be fair to both of us, I could come down to $1,350,000.  This offer still leaves some room for you to benefit greatly from the product's potential.  What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
