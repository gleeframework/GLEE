Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

We are still significantly above John's offer, and I believe Bob might be willing to go a bit higher. Let's see if we can push him a little further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us.  While your offer is tempting, I'm still confident in the product's value exceeding that mark. How about $1,175,000? That's a significant compromise on my end and reflects my eagerness to do business with you."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,175,000 and my previous offer of $1,050,000. How about we try $1,112,500? I believe that's a fair price for the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer"" 
}
```

While we could potentially push Bob a little further, accepting his offer of $1,125,000 is a good deal. It's significantly higher than John's offer, and we're already past the halfway point in our negotiations. Accepting now secures a substantial profit and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer further or us having to settle for John's offer in the later rounds."
