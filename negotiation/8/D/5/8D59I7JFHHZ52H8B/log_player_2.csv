{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than what John is offering.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to John's offer of $1,000,000. This counteroffer starts the negotiation at a point that's still within Bob's budget but significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. It's a reasonable starting point that might incentivize Alice to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than John's offer. Bob is trying to save as much as possible, and rejecting the offer gives him another chance to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly increasing his offer, showing willingness to negotiate while still staying below John's price. This counteroffer is a compromise, aiming to meet Alice halfway while still saving money compared to her last offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. Bob is trying to save money and is willing to continue negotiating. Rejecting the offer keeps the door open for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to Alice's offer but is still trying to negotiate a lower price. This counteroffer shows that Bob is willing to compromise but is not willing to pay more than $1,100,000. This price is also slightly higher than John's offer, which might incentivize Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,180,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's desired price point.  With only 3 rounds remaining, the risk of continuing negotiations with Alice is high.  Alice has shown a willingness to drop her price incrementally, but she's not showing a strong desire to compromise.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to secure the product at John's guaranteed price of $1,000,000.  This guarantees the purchase within Bob's budget and eliminates the risk of further negotiation."
