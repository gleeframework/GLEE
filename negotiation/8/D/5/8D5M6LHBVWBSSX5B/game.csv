"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that's worth $10,000 to you. I'm willing to make a fair offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9,000.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm prepared to offer $8,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $8,800. This is a fair price that I think we can both agree on.",8800.0,Alice,3,
