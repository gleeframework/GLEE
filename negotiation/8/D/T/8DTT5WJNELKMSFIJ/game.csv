"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to offer $8500 for the product. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. Would you be willing to meet me there?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9500 for the product. Let's meet in the middle.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I can meet you halfway between $9500 and $11000, which would be $10250. Would you be willing to consider that?",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still hesitant to go above $9500. How about we split the difference and I offer you $10000 for the product? I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I've already told you that I'm not willing to go below $11000. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make at least $10800 to make this deal worthwhile. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",10800.0,Alice,7,
