"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a starting price of $1,800,000. This is a rare chance to own something truly exceptional.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable,  $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000.  Let me know your thoughts.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $600,000 severely undervalues this product and its potential. I'm willing to adjust my price to $1,400,000. This reflects its true worth while still offering you a significant return on investment.  What do you say?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, there's still a substantial gap between our valuations.  To be candid, anything over $800,000 will be a difficult sell for me.  I could go up to $750,000 if that gets us closer to a deal.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but this product's value is firmly above $750,000. I'm willing to make a final offer at $1,100,000. This is a considerable compromise and a fair deal considering its potential. Let me know if you're ready to move forward.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting very close to John's offer. I'm willing to go up to $850,000, but that's absolutely my limit.  If we can't make a deal at this price, I'll unfortunately have to go with John's offer.",850000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we're getting close on price. Let's wrap this up. To show my commitment to making this work, I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is a significant compromise on my end and reflects my desire to see this valuable product in your hands. What do you say, shall we make a deal?",975000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is a little too close to John's offer for my liking.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925,000. Let's close this deal.",925000.0,Bob,8,
