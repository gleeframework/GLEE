"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, I'm looking for a slightly lower price to make this work for me. I'd be willing to pay $950000.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $1025000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair price for this amazing product.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
