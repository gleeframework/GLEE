I'm starting with a price of $18,000.  This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum, but hopefully leaves room for negotiation.  I'll see how Bob reacts and adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

$10,000 is too low for me. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.  I'm hoping to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering $15,000. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.  Hopefully, this will be more appealing to Bob."
