"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which still allows for a good profit for both of us.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $850,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $825,000, which is closer to our target price.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",825000.0,Bob,4,
