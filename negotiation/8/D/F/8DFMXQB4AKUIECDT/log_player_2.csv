**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Bottom Line:**  Alice has explicitly stated that $1,200,000 is her minimum price. It's unlikely she'll go lower.
* **Added Value:** The ""extras"" she's offering might make this deal even better than initially thought. 
* **Time:**  While we have rounds left, there's no guarantee of a better outcome.  Prolonging negotiations might lead to Alice becoming less willing to compromise. 

It's a good deal considering our maximum budget and Alice's position."
