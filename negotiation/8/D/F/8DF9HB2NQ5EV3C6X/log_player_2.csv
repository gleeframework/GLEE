"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1000000. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity!  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save some money."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750000 is a little lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference and settle at $875000?  That way, we both walk away feeling good about the deal.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:

While I'd love to keep negotiating, Alice's counteroffer of $875,000 is a good compromise.  It's a significant saving compared to John's price of $1,500,000, and it's likely that further negotiation will only yield small reductions."
