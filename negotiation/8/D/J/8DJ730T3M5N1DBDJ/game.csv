"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,400,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  This is my best offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer you $1,275,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?",1275000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to go down to $1,275,000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,325,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?",1325000.0,Alice,5,
