"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price close to Bob's perceived value ($150) to maximize potential profit.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** There's room for Bob to counteroffer, allowing for a potential middle ground.
* **Friendly tone:** The message is friendly and invites Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** My goal is to maximize profit, and $130 is still below my desired profit margin.
* **Negotiation:** Rejecting allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a price closer to my initial offer.
* **Alternative:** While selling to John for $120 is a safe option, it doesn't maximize my earnings.  

I'll counteroffer Bob in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $140."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $135 feels like a fairer price given the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate by lowering my price slightly.
* **Maintain Profit:**  $135 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Keep the Negotiation Going:**  This counteroffer encourages Bob to consider a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still thinking $125 is a more reasonable price for me. Can you consider meeting me at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Bob's offer of $130 is close to my counteroffer of $135.  
* **Profitable outcome:**  $130 is above my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Time constraint:**  We are already in round 4, and there are limited rounds left to reach an agreement.  Accepting this offer secures a decent profit and minimizes the risk of further negotiation. 

While I might prefer a slightly higher price, the risk of further negotiation might lead to a lower offer or even rejection from Bob."
