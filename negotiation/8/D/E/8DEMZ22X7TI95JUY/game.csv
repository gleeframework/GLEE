"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is significantly below what this product is truly worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which reflects a fair compromise.  I believe this price still offers you a solid return on your investment, and I'm confident the product will exceed your expectations.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and my budget. I'm open to further discussion, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $950,000 is still far below what this product is truly worth.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,000,000, which is still a great deal considering its potential value.  This price is my final offer.  If you're not interested, I'll have to explore other options.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
