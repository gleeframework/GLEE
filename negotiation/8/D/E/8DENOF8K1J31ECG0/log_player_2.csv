"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth at least $80 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair for both of us. How about $100?  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $100 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a better price.  Alice might be willing to come down closer to her $80 value, saving you even more money."
