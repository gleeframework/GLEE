"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand your position, Bob. However, I believe the product's value to you is higher than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000.",1150000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm offering $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1100000.0,Bob,4,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,100,000, but I need to make a bit more. I'll counteroffer at $1,125,000. This is my final concession, and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value.",1125000.0,Alice,5,,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, and I respect your position. However, $1,125,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford. I'm prepared to pay $1,105,000. This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll need to explore other options.",1105000.0,Bob,6,,
