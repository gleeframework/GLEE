"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer. It makes sense to negotiate and see if you can get a better deal from Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

This counter-offer achieves a few things:

* **Polite and interested:**  It acknowledges Alice's offer and expresses continued interest in the product.
* **Strong counter:**  Starting significantly lower than your maximum price leaves room for negotiation.
* **Opens dialogue:**  It invites Alice to counter, encouraging a back-and-forth to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm still looking for a good profit on this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice came down significantly, the offer is still above your maximum price and what John is offering.  There's room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice. $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? That feels like a fair deal to me."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

Here's the reasoning:

* **Acknowledgement:** We acknowledge Alice's move towards a compromise.
* **Firm but fair:** We stand our ground at our maximum price, signaling this is our limit.
* **Justification:**  Phrasing it as ""meeting in the middle"" makes it seem like an attractive compromise for Alice.
* **Clear objective:** By stating our desired price outright, we avoid ambiguity and encourage Alice to either accept or make a counter-offer closer to our target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 is a good price for you, Bob, but I'm still not getting the profit I was hoping for. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $13,500. This is the lowest I can go and still make a reasonable profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer, but the offer is still above your maximum and what John offers. It's worth one more attempt to negotiate for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm very interested in the product, but $13,500 is pushing my budget. I could do $12,500 as my absolute final offer. If that doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 12500
}
```

Rationale:

* **Urgency and Limit:** This counteroffer conveys a sense of urgency by presenting it as a ""final offer"" and hinting at alternatives (John's offer). This might encourage Alice to accept if she's keen on selling.
* **Slight Concession:**  Moving up to $12,500 shows a willingness to compromise, which might be enough to seal the deal without going to John. 
* **Clear Expectation:**  We're clearly communicating our limit, so Alice doesn't have any false hope for a higher price. 

This strategy aims for a best-case scenario: getting the product from Alice at a slightly discounted price. If she rejects this, we can always buy from John, knowing we tried our best to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,500 is your final offer, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not getting the profit I was hoping for. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $13,000. This is the lowest I can go and still make a reasonable profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's time to cut our losses. Alice is unlikely to go below $13,000, and we've already reached our absolute limit. John's offer of $12,000 is a sure thing at this point, and further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to yield a better outcome."
