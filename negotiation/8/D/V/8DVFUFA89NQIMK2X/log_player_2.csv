"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  There's room for negotiation, so it makes sense to reject the offer and see if Alice will come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the deal, but I'm really looking to stay within my budget.  How about $10,500? "", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down a bit, but Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  There's still room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and counter-offering again makes sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to Bob's budget, but it's still $900 above his maximum. With five rounds left, Bob still has time to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm really trying to stay under $10,750, so I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $10,750.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7

# Alice's message: I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,800. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is very close to his budget limit, but Alice is still above it. It's worth seeing if Alice will come down further, since they're only $50 apart now.  There's still time to negotiate, and Bob may be able to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's split the difference and call it $10,775.  This is the very best I can do, and I'm hopeful we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10775}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,850. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,850. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,850
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only two rounds remaining, Alice is still $150 above Bob's desired price. While a counteroffer is possible, it's risky.  Bob is very close to his budget limit, and there's no guarantee Alice will accept. Buying from John guarantees a purchase within budget and avoids any further negotiation risk."
