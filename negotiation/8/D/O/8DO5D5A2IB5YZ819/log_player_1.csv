"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This gives me a good starting point for negotiation and leaves room for potential concessions. Since Bob values the product at $10,000, he might be willing to pay a little extra to secure it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm open to negotiation, $8,500 is significantly below my minimum price of $10,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to counter with $10,500.  This is a compromise that's closer to my starting price but still leaves room for Bob to negotiate if he wants to.  I think this is a fair price given that Bob values the product at $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm going to counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with my minimum price of $10,000. We're getting close to a deal and I'm confident Bob will see this as a reasonable price."
