"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1400000 is still too high for me. Considering my budget and the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $900000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1150000. This gives you a significant saving, and I still get a reasonable price. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1150000 is still out of my price range.  Let's try to meet in the middle.  I'm prepared to offer $1000000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to stay within my budget and you to get a good deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1000000 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of the product and the fact that we're both trying to find a solution, I'm willing to come down to $1200000. This would allow me to move forward while still providing you with a considerable discount from my initial offer. Let's see if we can find common ground on this.",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1200000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1050000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  It's a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
