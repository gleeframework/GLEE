"Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product. I'm confident it's worth $1,200,000 to you, as you've indicated.  To start, I'm asking for $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is significantly lower than what I need to accept.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This still represents a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but no higher. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",950000.0,Bob,4,
