"Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand you're looking for a lower price,  $130 is below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $160, but that's my final offer. Let me know if you're interested.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $145 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $150, my minimum price. If you're interested, let me know. Otherwise, I'll be moving on to other potential buyers.",150.0,Alice,5,
