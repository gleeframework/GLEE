"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I believe the product's value is not quite as high as you think. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. I think this is a fair price considering its worth and potential returns. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However,  $1,400,000 is significantly below my initial assessment of the product's value. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see a price that reflects its true potential. How about we meet halfway and settle on $1,600,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I still think $1,600,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll propose $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential returns. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Even though Bob has met my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still a chance to negotiate a slightly higher price. I'll try one more time to see if I can get closer to $1,300,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,200,000 is a tempting offer, I'm still confident that this product can generate significant returns beyond that. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,350,000? This reflects both of our positions and ensures a mutually beneficial deal."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,350,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and propose $1,250,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential returns. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While I could push for a bit more, accepting $1,250,000 is a good outcome.  It's a significant profit above my minimum, and continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob entirely."
