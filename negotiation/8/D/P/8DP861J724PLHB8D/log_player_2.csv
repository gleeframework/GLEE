"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $20,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $12,000 to you, and Alice's offer is way too high. It's best to reject and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20,000 is quite a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $12,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is just too low for me. This product is truly valuable and I'm confident you'd benefit greatly from it. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$17,000 is still too high for Bob, even though it's a better offer than the first one.  It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $17,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to pay $14,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me and allows me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're getting closer. I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we split the difference and settle on $15,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is getting closer to your price, $15,500 is still more than you're willing to pay. It's worth continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $15,500 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm ready to pay $14,500 for the product. This feels like a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 14500}
