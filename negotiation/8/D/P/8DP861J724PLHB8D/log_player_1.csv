Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20,000 is quite a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $12,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is just too low for me. This product is truly valuable and I'm confident you'd benefit greatly from it. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $17,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to pay $14,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me and allows me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000.
