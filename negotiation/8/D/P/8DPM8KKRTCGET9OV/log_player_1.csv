Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something a bit more reasonable. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $1,300,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. $1,300,000 is still a good deal for him, and I think I can get closer to my desired price."

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,325,000 is still a good deal for me.  I'm getting closer to my desired amount, and it's worth risking a bit to close this deal rather than risk getting a lower offer from John."
