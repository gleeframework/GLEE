{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is above my maximum budget of $1,200,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential value of the product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I need to ensure I receive a fair value for this product. I'm prepared to reduce my price to $1,350,000. This still leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement, and it's a significant investment on your end. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. It's too early to buy from John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,350,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm prepared to go to $1,300,000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your commitment to reaching an agreement. While $1,300,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still not quite there. To demonstrate my willingness to work with you, I'm prepared to offer the product for $1,325,000. This is a significant investment for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows us to both benefit from this deal. Let's close this negotiation and finalize this agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,325,000 is still higher than my maximum budget of $1,200,000.  We've reached a point where further negotiation is unlikely to get the price down to where I'm comfortable.  It's time to take the guaranteed deal with John and avoid further risk of losing the product completely."
