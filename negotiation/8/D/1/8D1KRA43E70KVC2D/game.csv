"Hello Bob, I'm excited to showcase this product to you. I believe it holds immense value, especially for someone with your vision. I'm initially offering it at $2,200,000.  I'm confident this price reflects its true worth and potential.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $2,200,000. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. I believe this price is more reasonable considering the market value.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price. This product has a lot of untapped potential that I believe justifies a higher value. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.  Let me know what you think.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your concerns about the product's potential, but I still think $2,000,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the potential returns on investment.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I appreciate you working with me on this. While I value meeting halfway, I'm aiming for a slightly higher return. How about $1,975,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while acknowledging the inherent value of this product.",1975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,975,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to compromise and offer $1,850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the potential returns on investment. I'm getting close to walking away and buying from John, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle.",1850000.0,Bob,6,
