"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1300000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. Can you consider it?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your perspective on the price. However, $1200000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product for you. Let's split the difference -  I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This is a fair price considering the potential this product offers. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1250000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1150000 for the product. Can we meet in the middle?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. While $1150000 is a fair price, it still doesn't quite meet my expectations. I'm willing to come down to $1200000, which is a good compromise considering the value this product offers. I believe this is a mutually beneficial price. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
