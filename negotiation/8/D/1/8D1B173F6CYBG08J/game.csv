"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $11,500 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! However, $10,500 is still a bit below my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair deal. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $11,250. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the value the product brings to you.",11250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $11,250 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $10,750, which is a fair compromise for both of us. This would allow me to purchase the product without breaking my budget, and it would still offer you a good profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement on this price.",10750.0,Bob,4,
