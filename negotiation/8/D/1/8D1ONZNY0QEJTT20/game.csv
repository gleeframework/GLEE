"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1,000,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get this amazing product.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
