Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to get a better deal. Given the potential value of this product to me, I'm willing to pay $1200000. Let's see if we can find common ground.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1300000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price.  Let's split the difference and aim for $1250000.  This would allow me to make a good investment, and you'd still gain a significant profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $1,250,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe we can still reach a better agreement.  I'm not yet at a point where selling to John is more appealing."
