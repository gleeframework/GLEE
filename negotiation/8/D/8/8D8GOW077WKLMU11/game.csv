"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $1200000 is too low for me at this point. I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a profit. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1300000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price.  Let's split the difference and aim for $1250000.  This would allow me to make a good investment, and you'd still gain a significant profit.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
