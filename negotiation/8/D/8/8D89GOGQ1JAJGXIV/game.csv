"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,800,000 is still quite a ways off from what I have in mind. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet halfway at $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm sensing your hesitation is more about the perceived risk than the actual value.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,825,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value you'll gain from this product.",1825000.0,Alice,5,
