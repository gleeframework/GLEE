Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is only worth $80 to me, so accepting Alice's offer of $100 is not a good deal.  I'll try to negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 70}
``` 

I'll offer Alice $70 for the product. This is a fair price, as it's less than what the product is worth to me, and it gives Alice some room to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $92 is closer to my desired price, it's still too high. I'll try to negotiate further with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}

I'll offer Alice $75 for the product. This is a compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering our previous negotiations."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

$89 is still a bit too high for me. I'll continue to negotiate with Alice to try and get a better price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}

I'll offer Alice $80 for the product. This is my final offer, as it's the maximum I'm willing to pay. If Alice rejects this, I'll purchase from John."
