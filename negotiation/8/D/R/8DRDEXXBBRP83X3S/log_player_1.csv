Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}

I'm starting with my ideal price, as it's the minimum I'm willing to accept. While I'm willing to negotiate, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay what the product is worth to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'd like to sell the product, it's worth more to me than his offer. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $11,500. It's a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it's still above Bob's valuation and a decent compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob seems unwilling to negotiate. While I'd like to sell the product to Bob, I'm not going to waste more time on a negotiation that's unlikely to reach a mutually beneficial price.  I'm better off selling the product to John for my minimum acceptable price."
