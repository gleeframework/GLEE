"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's still below my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Fairness Appeal:**  I'm framing the price as ""fair"" based on Bob's perceived value of the product. This might encourage him to consider it.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message implies I'm open to discussion, avoiding a hard ""take it or leave it"" stance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am hoping to keep the price within my budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,350,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal is $1,500,000:**  My goal is to get as close to my minimum as possible, and $1,350,000 is still significantly lower. 
* **Negotiation Room:** I want to keep the negotiation going. Rejecting allows me to counter-offer and potentially increase the price.
* **John's Offer:** While John offers my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell immediately. There's a chance I can get closer to my minimum through negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I can't go as low as $1,350,000, I'm willing to come down to $1,380,000.  This reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1380000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by lowering my price from $1,400,000.
* **Value Focus:**  I'm still emphasizing the value of the product, which justifies the slightly higher price.
* **Open-Ended Question:** The message encourages Bob to respond and continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the product's value and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $1,360,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,360,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,360,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,360,000 is still below my minimum of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation Leverage:** I have a few rounds left, and there's still room to push for a higher price.
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is enticing, I'm confident I can get closer to my minimum with Bob.

**Next Move:**  I will counter-offer Bob again, trying to bridge the gap between our positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,370,000. This is a fair price that considers both our positions. Let's close this deal and make it happen."", ""product_price"": 1370000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his last offer ($1,360,000) and my previous offer ($1,380,000).
* **Urgency:** The message adds a sense of urgency by saying ""Let's close this deal,"" implying that I'm getting closer to my limit.
* **Fairness Appeal:**  I'm again emphasizing fairness, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of reason."
