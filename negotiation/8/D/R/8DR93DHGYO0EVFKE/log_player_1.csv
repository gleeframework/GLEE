"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I believe the product is worth to Bob, hoping to maximize my potential profit.  I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm lowering my price to $130, which is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150. This shows flexibility while still trying to secure a good deal."
