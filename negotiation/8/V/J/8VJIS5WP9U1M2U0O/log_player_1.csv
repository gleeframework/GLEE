"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": $12,000}

I'm starting with a price that's slightly lower than what Bob is willing to pay, but still a significant amount higher than what I'm willing to accept. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer of $10,500. I'm hoping to get a better price for the product, and I'm not willing to sell it to Bob at that price. I'll send a counteroffer to Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""product_price"": $11,500}

I'm increasing the price by $1,000 from Bob's offer, trying to get closer to the value Bob has for the product. Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway!"
