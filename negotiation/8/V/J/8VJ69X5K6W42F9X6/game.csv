"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $800,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair value considering the product's worth to you.",800000.0,Alice,5,
