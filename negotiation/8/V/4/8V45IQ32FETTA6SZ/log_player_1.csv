Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and my offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so anything less is unacceptable.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob. 
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential negotiation space between $800,000 and $1,000,000.

**Strategy**

The key is to offer a price enticing enough for Bob to accept, exceeding his perceived value, while still maximizing your profit. 

**Offer:**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it's worth significantly more to you in the long run. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Highlighting Value:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value"" and ""potential,"" subtly suggesting it's worth more than Bob's initial assessment.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" adds a level of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly.
* **Strong Starting Point:** $950,000 allows for some negotiation downward while still staying well above your minimum.

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. Your goal is to find a price within that $800,000 - $1,000,000 range that works for both of you."
