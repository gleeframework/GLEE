Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with my ideal price. I know it's unlikely Bob will accept this immediately, but it sets the bar high and shows him the value I place on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I could take the $800,000, I'm confident I can get closer to my ideal price with some negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm dropping the price slightly to show I'm open to negotiation, but still maintaining a significant margin.  Hopefully, this will encourage Bob to come up a bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum value, I think I can still squeeze a bit more out of Bob.  I'm willing to risk losing some time to see if I can close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering a price that's halfway between my last offer and Bob's. I hope this will show him that I'm serious about negotiating and that I'm willing to meet him halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $980,000 is close to my minimum, it's still below what John is offering, and I'm not convinced I can get Bob to budge further. Time is valuable, and I don't want to risk losing John's offer. It's time to move on."
