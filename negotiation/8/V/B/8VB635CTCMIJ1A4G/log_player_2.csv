"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $110, which is a great deal.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than the $120 value to her, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay.  He can get the product for $100 from John, so rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best option."
