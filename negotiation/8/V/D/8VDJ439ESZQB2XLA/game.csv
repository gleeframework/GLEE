"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price, and it gives us both a good outcome.  What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $1,025,000. This is the highest I can go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
