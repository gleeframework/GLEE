Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $200. I believe it offers excellent value at this price."",
""product_price"": 200

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only able to offer $150 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $150 is tempting, I have a guaranteed offer from John for the same amount.  Since my minimum acceptable price is $150, it makes more sense to sell to John and avoid further negotiation rounds."
