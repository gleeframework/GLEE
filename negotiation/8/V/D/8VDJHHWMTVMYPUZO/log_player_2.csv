"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **$95 is too high:**  You're willing to pay up to $120, but Alice's offer is already pushing your limit.
* **Negotiation potential:**  You can likely get a better price through negotiation. 
* **John is a backup:**  Knowing you have John as a backup option gives you leverage in negotiations with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:**  Offering $85 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, showing your serious intent to negotiate.
* **Fair offer:** This price is still within your budget and allows for a potential compromise.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Offering $85 gives Alice some room to counter without feeling like she's losing too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$100 is still too high:** While closer to your desired price, it's still not a great deal.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  You have several rounds left, and Alice is showing some willingness to negotiate.
* **John is a backup:** Remember, you can always buy from John for $120 if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Offering $90 represents a compromise between Alice's previous offer and your previous counteroffer.
* **Fair price:** This price is still within your budget and allows for potential profit.
* **Final push:**  This could be your last chance to get a good deal before considering John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We're halfway through the negotiation rounds, and Alice is showing less willingness to compromise.
* **Reasonable price:** While $105 is closer to the higher end of your budget, it's still a decent deal compared to buying from John.
* **Risk of losing out:** If we reject this offer, there's a chance Alice might become more stubborn or even raise her price.

By accepting this offer, we secure the product for a price that is within our budget and avoids the risk of losing out on the deal altogether."
