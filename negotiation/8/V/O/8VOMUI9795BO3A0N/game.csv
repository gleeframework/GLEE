,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $12,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $18,000. This is my final offer.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has value, but $18,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $14,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",14000.0,Bob,4,
