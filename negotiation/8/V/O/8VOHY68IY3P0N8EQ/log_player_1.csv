""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I think this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While selling to John guarantees $1,000,000, aiming higher with Bob could yield a significantly larger profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price of $1,350,000 leaves a good margin for negotiation while still securing a significant portion of the product's value to Bob ($150,000 less than his perceived value).
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the product's value and fairness of the price, increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer.

This strategy prioritizes maximizing potential earnings while still offering Bob a price that's compelling compared to his perceived value."
