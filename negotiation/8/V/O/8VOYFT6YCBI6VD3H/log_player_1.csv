Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $9,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $9,500, knowing it's above Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** I'm leaving a buffer so I can potentially lower the price a bit if Bob makes a counteroffer, without dropping below my minimum acceptable value.
* **Keeping John in Mind:** By offering $9,500, I'm still close enough to John's offer of $10,000 to make it worthwhile to negotiate with Bob, but I'm not risking getting stuck with a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit steep for me, though.  Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $7,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $10,000 and even below the $8,000 Bob values the product at. Accepting would result in a huge loss.
* **Potential for a better deal:** While Bob is unwilling to pay my initial price, it's possible that with a counteroffer I can still reach a price closer to my desired value.  
* **John is a backup:**  Even if negotiations with Bob fail, I have a guaranteed $10,000 offer from John, so there's no pressure to accept a low price just to make a sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  How about $8,500?  This is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Fair Value:** $8,500 is still significantly above Bob's offer, but it's closer to his perceived value of $8,000, making it more appealing. 
* **Keeping Options Open:**  I'm still leaving some room for further negotiation, but I'm not risking going too low.
* **John as Backup:** I'm confident John's $10,000 offer will ensure I don't settle for a significantly lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product, but I have a budget in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $8,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $8,250 is still above my minimum acceptable value of $10,000, but it's getting closer to my ideal price. 
* **Avoiding further negotiation:** While I could try to negotiate further, there's a chance Bob might walk away, leaving me with no deal. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids potential delays.
* **Minimizing risk:** It's unlikely I can get a much higher offer from Bob, and John's offer provides a safety net in case things fall through. 

**Conclusion:** Accepting Bob's offer of $8,250 strikes a balance between maximizing my profit and minimizing the risk of losing the sale."
