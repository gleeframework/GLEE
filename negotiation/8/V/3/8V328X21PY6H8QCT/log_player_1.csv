{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **My Floor:** I'm not willing to sell for less than $120 to John, so that's my floor.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $80, so I need to offer something higher than that to entice him. 
* **Negotiation:** A price of $100 gives me a good starting point. It's a reasonable compromise and gives Bob some room to negotiate.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! I've earned $100.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation. 
* If Bob's counteroffer is too low, I can make a new counteroffer closer to my floor price. 
* If negotiations stall or I feel the price won't go up, I can always choose to sell to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I've seen similar products in the market for that price, and I'd like to get a good deal. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Floor:**  I'm not willing to sell for less than $120 to John, so $80 is too low for me.
* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob's offer is fair based on his perception of the market, it doesn't meet my minimum requirement. 
* **Negotiation:** I need to counteroffer to get closer to a price that works for me. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob that's closer to my desired price. This will give me a better chance of getting a higher price while still keeping the possibility of a deal with Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $80 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95. This is still a good price for you, and it gives me a bit more wiggle room to make this work. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Floor:** I'm not willing to sell for less than $120 to John, so I need to stay above that.
* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $80 is too low, but it shows he's willing to negotiate.
* **Negotiation:** $95 is a compromise. It's a significant drop from my initial offer but still above Bob's. This shows I'm willing to work with him, but I'm not giving away the farm. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've earned a decent amount, and we've reached a mutually agreeable price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to assess his next counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $95, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we meet at $87.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Floor:** I'm not willing to sell for less than $120 to John.  
* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my previous counteroffer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Negotiation:** I need to push back and counteroffer to see if we can reach a price closer to my floor. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll make another counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $100. This shows I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm still not willing to go below a certain point."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $87.50 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet at $92.50? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to cover my costs. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Floor:** I'm not willing to sell for less than $120 to John, so $92.50 is still a decent margin for me.
* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, but it's still too low.
* **Negotiation:** $92.50 is a compromise, but it's still closer to my initial offer and keeps the negotiation moving forward. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good price for the product. 
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to decide whether to make another counteroffer or to sell the product to John.  It depends on how much I value closing a deal with Bob versus securing the higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to cover your costs, but I'm still not comfortable with $92.50. I'm willing to meet you at $90, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. Can you accept that price?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Floor:** I'm not willing to sell for less than $120 to John.
* **Bob's Offer:**  While $90 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Negotiation:**  It's getting increasingly difficult to reach a price that works for both of us. I've already made several concessions. 
* **John's Offer:** John is guaranteed to buy the product for $120, giving me the best possible outcome.

**Next Steps:**

* I'm choosing to sell the product to John because it guarantees me a price that meets my minimum requirement and allows me to move on.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, the negotiations have stalled, and I don't want to risk losing out on a better deal."
