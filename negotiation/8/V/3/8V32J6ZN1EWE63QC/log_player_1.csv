"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, but I'm open to discussing further."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value and potential,"" providing a basis for the high initial price. 
* **Openness to Negotiation:** I signal that I'm willing to negotiate, which is crucial in multi-round bargaining.

The goal is to anchor Bob's perception of the product's value at a higher point and to gather information about his willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is much higher than my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is exactly his perceived value, which was expected. While I have the option to sell to John for a guaranteed $1,000,000, there's still room for negotiation with Bob. Accepting his first offer would leave a significant amount of money on the table. I'll provide a counteroffer in the next round to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below what I can accept. This product offers unique value that I'm confident justifies a higher price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still reflecting the product's true worth."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conveying Value:** I'm reiterating that the product holds significant value, aiming to shift Bob's perception from his initial $800,000 offer.
* **Significant Drop:** The substantial reduction from $1,500,000 to $1,200,000 signals flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer still leaves room for further negotiation while keeping the price well above both Bob's initial offer and my minimum selling point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $1,200,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are making progress! Bob increased his offer by $100,000, showing he's willing to negotiate. However, we are still significantly away from my $1,000,000 minimum. Selling to John is becoming a more attractive option, but I believe I can still nudge Bob closer to my target in the remaining rounds.  We will continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price.  To be frank, $900,000 is still quite a bit below what I was hoping for. However, I value our developing business relationship and I'm motivated to find an agreement. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a significant concession and reflects my strong desire to work with you."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Progress:** I start by recognizing Bob's upward movement, encouraging further negotiation.
* **Firm but Fair:** While stating that his offer is lower than desired, I also convey a strong interest in closing a deal. 
* **Justifying the Price:** I'm framing the lower price as a concession driven by my desire to build a business relationship with Bob, subtly appealing to his desire for a positive interaction.
* **Strategic Positioning:** The $1,100,000 price keeps me above my minimum while aiming to draw Bob closer to a more acceptable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is getting closer, but still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a serious offer, and if you want to work with me, I think this is a good place for us to meet. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiation:**  While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, the increments are becoming smaller.  We are still $50,000 away from my minimum, and Bob's latest message suggests he might not be willing to move much further.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of not reaching a satisfactory agreement. I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,000,000.
* **Time Value:** Every round spent on negotiation with Bob is a round I can't spend exploring other opportunities or engaging with John.

It's time to cut my losses with Bob.  The potential gains from further negotiation are outweighed by the guaranteed offer from John."
