Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but still lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000).
* This leaves room for negotiation, allowing me to potentially earn more than Bob's initial value while still potentially securing a sale.
* If Bob rejects, I can gauge his interest and adjust my counteroffers accordingly.
* Having John as a backup option provides leverage and prevents me from settling for too low of a price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* I believe there's still room for negotiation. 
* By rejecting his offer, I can counter with a price closer to my desired range and see if he's willing to budge.
* Selling to John at this point would result in a significantly higher profit. However, I'm willing to explore further negotiation with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm lowering my price from the previous round to $11,000, which is still higher than Bob's current offer of $9,000 but significantly lower than my initial offer of $13,000. 
* This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price point that is closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* This counteroffer gives Bob a chance to come closer to my desired price range without pushing him away entirely.
* I'm still keeping in mind the option of selling to John for $15,000, which provides leverage during the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's offer of $10,000 is still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* While I am willing to negotiate,  further rounds of negotiation with Bob are unlikely to yield a significantly higher offer.
* Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and a higher profit than accepting Bob's offer.
* The potential for additional negotiation with Bob is outweighed by the certainty of a higher profit by selling to John."
