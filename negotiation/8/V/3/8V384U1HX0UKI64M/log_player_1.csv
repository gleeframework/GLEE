"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept right away. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Room for Compromise:** $18,000 is a good starting point, leaving room for compromise and still exceeding my minimum value.
* **Enthusiasm:** I'm expressing enthusiasm to make the offer seem attractive and encourage Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $12,000 is below my minimum value of $15,000. I'm not willing to accept this price.
* **Negotiation opportunity:**  I can still potentially get a better price by rejecting Bob's offer and counteroffering.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** I know I can get $15,000 from John, which is my minimum acceptable price, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $12,000 is significantly below what the product is worth. Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to lower my price to $16,000.  This gives you a good price, and it's fair to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm not accepting Bob's low offer, but I'm also not immediately jumping to my minimum. This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Reasonable Compromise:**  $16,000 is a good middle ground. It's still above my minimum value, and it's a lower price than my initial offer.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is valuable, emphasizing the ""good deal"" aspect to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $16,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise and offer $14,500. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $14,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm not willing to sell for less than that.
* **John is a safe option:**  I know I can get $15,000 from John, so I don't have to settle for a lower price from Bob.
* **Negotiation leverage:** I have several rounds left, and I'm confident I can get Bob to agree to a higher price if I keep rejecting his offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $14,500 is still quite a bit below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and lower my price to $15,500. This is a very fair price considering the value of the product. If you're truly interested, I believe this is the best we can do."", ""product_price"": 15500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying Firm:** I'm not budging below my minimum value, but I'm showing flexibility by offering a slight compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's worth and presenting my offer as ""fair"" to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Creating Urgency (Subtly):** By saying ""This is the best we can do,"" I'm subtly implying that I'm getting closer to my limit and may not budge further. This might encourage Bob to make a final push."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but $15,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, but that's the highest I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $14,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 4 rounds remaining, the chances of getting a better offer from Bob are getting slim.
* **Safe Option:** John is guaranteed to buy the product for $15,000, my minimum, so it's the safest and most financially secure choice at this point.  

I'm not willing to risk further negotiation, especially with John's offer as a safety net."
