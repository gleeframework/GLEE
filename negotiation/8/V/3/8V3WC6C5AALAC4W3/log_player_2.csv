Since your maximum budget is $10,000, Alice's offer of $15,000 is too high. It's best to reject the offer and see if you can negotiate a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to be flexible, but I still need to get a good price for the product.
