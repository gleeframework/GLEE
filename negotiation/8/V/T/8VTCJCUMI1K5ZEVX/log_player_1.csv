Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $15,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I think it would be a valuable asset for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product at $13,000. This is a compromise - it's more than Bob's value of $12,000 but less than my minimum of $15,000. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value the product could bring to Bob. I highlight that I'm willing to sell it for less than it's worth to me, suggesting a good deal. 

**Reasoning:**

By offering a slightly lower price, I increase the chances of Bob accepting the offer. If he rejects it, I have a guaranteed sale to John for $15,000.  This strategy balances the risk of a lower price with the potential for a quick sale."
