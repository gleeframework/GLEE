Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique chance to acquire something truly exceptional."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since we know Bob values the product at $1,200,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at that price to John, we start by aiming higher.  A price of $1,500,000 leaves room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the high price. By using language like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique chance,"" we aim to create a sense of scarcity and desirability.
* **Fallback Option:** If Bob rejects the offer, we don't lose anything. We can confidently sell to John at our minimum acceptable price. 

This strategy prioritizes maximizing profit while acknowledging we may need to negotiate with Bob."
