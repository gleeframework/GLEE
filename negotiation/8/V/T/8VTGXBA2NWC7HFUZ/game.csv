"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider $60? I think that's a fair price.",60.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your position, but I must maintain the integrity of our product pricing. How about we meet in the middle at $90 for the product?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you finding some middle ground, Alice. $90 is closer, but I'm still a little tight on budget. Could you do $75? That would help me seal the deal.",75.0,Bob,4,

"I see your point, Bob. Let's try $80 for the product. This is the highest I can go while maintaining the value of our product. I hope this works for you.",80.0,Alice,5,
