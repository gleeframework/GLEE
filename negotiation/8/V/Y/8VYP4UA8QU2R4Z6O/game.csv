"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1,100,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is your maximum offer, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $1,020,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm not sure I can go any lower.",1020000.0,Alice,5,
