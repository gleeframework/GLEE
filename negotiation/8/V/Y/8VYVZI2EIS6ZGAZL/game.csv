"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point considering the significant returns you'll see.",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  While I agree this product has potential, that initial price is way too high for me. I'm willing to start the conversation at $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I understand your perspective on the price, but $800,000 is significantly below its true worth.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects the product's value while acknowledging we're in a negotiation.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,900,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  To be realistic, I can't go any higher than $1,200,000 for this product.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation. I appreciate you moving closer to a mutually agreeable price.  How about we land somewhere in the middle at $1,650,000? This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the true value of this product.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the effort to find a compromise. However, $1,650,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,350,000. This is a significant jump from my previous offer and reflects my strong interest in closing the deal.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
