Considering its true worth to you, I propose a price of $120 for this exceptional item. This offer reflects a fair compromise between its market value and your perceived worth, aiming to ensure both satisfaction and profitability. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $150. Since you're aiming to save as much money as possible, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best strategy. You can still get the product within your budget, albeit at a higher price."
