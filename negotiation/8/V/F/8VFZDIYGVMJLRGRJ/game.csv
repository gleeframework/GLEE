"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,"I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $9,000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you."
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,000. I'm really interested in the product and I think it's worth it to me, but I need to stay within my budget.",7000.0,Alice,3,,
