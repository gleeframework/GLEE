"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $15,000. It's a great opportunity to own a unique item that's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way above your budget and even higher than her own valuation of the product.  It's best to negotiate down significantly or consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting with a low offer ($6,000), we establish a negotiation anchor and leave room to move upward if needed.
* **Signaling Interest:** We don't want to appear disinterested by countering too low. $6,000 demonstrates we're serious but looking for a significant discount.
* **Gauge Alice's Response:** This counteroffer will help us understand Alice's flexibility and willingness to negotiate a price closer to our budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,000. I'm really interested in the product and I think it's worth it to me, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $7,000 is a significant discount from Alice's original offer and a good price below John's $8,000 offer. 
* **Saving Money:** You're achieving your goal of buying the product while saving a good amount of money. 
* **Avoiding Risk:**  Further negotiation might not yield a better price and could risk losing the deal altogether.  

It's a good time to accept and secure the product at this favorable price."
