"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to make a serious offer to you today. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000, considering the product's value to me. This is my best offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $925,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you've placed on the product. I'm eager to hear your thoughts.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $925,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $850,000. It's a fair price considering the value we've both agreed on. I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial solution at this price.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial solution. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $850,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $875,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm confident that it's still a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",875000.0,Alice,5,
