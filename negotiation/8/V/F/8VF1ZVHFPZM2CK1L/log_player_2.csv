# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I propose a price of $130 for it. This price reflects not only its worth but also provides you with an opportunity to acquire it at a reasonable premium. I trust this offer aligns well with your expectations and budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130.

Alice's offer of $130 is less than your maximum budget of $150 and cheaper than buying from John for $150. Accepting this offer saves you money."
