"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll really love it, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's start with a price of $9,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $9,000 is still too high for him, and he has room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $7,500. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $7,500 is a bit lower than you were hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $8,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his target, he can likely still get a better price. He's already shown he's willing to negotiate and Alice has shown a willingness to compromise. There's room to keep pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $8,500 is still a bit higher than I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to pay $8,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
