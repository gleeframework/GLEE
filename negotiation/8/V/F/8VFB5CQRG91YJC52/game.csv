"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $7,500. Let's see if we can work something out.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $7,500 is a bit lower than you were hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $8,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
