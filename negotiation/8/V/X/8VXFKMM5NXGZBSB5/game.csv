"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $13,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is still a good price for you, considering the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen!",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $12,500 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,250. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can offer at this time.",12250.0,Bob,4,
