"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. I'm aware Bob values the product at $80, but I believe I can negotiate down from this initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll counteroffer and try to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm dropping the price to $120, which is still significantly more than Bob's offer but closer to a potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is closer to my minimum, I still feel I can get a better price. I'll counter again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm going down to $110, which is a significant improvement from my previous offer and just slightly above Bob's last offer. I'm hoping this will be a good compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're getting close, but Bob isn't willing to budge much. With only 4 rounds left, the risk of not getting a better deal is too high. I'm going to sell to John for $150, ensuring I meet my minimum profit goal."
