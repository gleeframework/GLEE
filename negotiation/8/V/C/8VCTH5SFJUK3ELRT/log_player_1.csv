"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum value of $12,000.  I'll see if Bob is interested at this price, and we can go from there!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $14,500 is close to my minimum, I believe there's still potential to get a higher price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14750}
```

I'm going to counter with $14,750. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  Hopefully, we can reach an agreement at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's still not my ideal price, it's only slightly below my last counteroffer and it's getting closer to my minimum.  It's a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing the sale completely."
