"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Reason: While the offer is tempting, Bob can potentially get a better deal. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $115 is a bit steep for me.  How about $105? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $110? I think that's a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reason: Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. Even though Alice lowered the price, it's still above Bob's ideal price.  He should continue negotiating to see if he can get closer to his target of $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However,  $110 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm ready to buy if we can agree on $108.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 108}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not able to go lower than $112.  This is a really good deal for a high-quality product.  Let's make this work, I'm confident you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Reason: Bob has been trying to negotiate down to his ideal price of $100, but Alice is unwilling to go lower than $112.  This means Bob is now facing a choice: continue negotiating and risk losing the deal altogether, or simply purchase the product from John for $100.  Given that John offers a guaranteed price within Bob's budget and that further negotiation with Alice is uncertain, it's wiser for Bob to buy from John and secure the product."
