# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your desire to get closer to your original offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $8750. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time, so I'm making a counteroffer of $8625. This is my last offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

``` 

While I would prefer to get closer to $9,000, I'm running out of time. Accepting Bob's offer of $8,625 ensures I get more than my minimum of $8,000, and also avoids the risk of having to sell to John for less."
