"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm still interested in purchasing the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? It's a fair price that acknowledges the value you'll gain from this product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $11,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $10,250, which is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I hope we can come to an agreement.",10250.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $10,250 is close, but I can't let it go for less than $10,750.  This is my final offer.",10750.0,Alice,5,
