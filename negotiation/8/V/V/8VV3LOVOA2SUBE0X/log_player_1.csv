"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer.  $10,500 is still too low for me.  I'll try to get a better price from Bob in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about $11,500? That's a fair compromise, and it's still a good deal for you."", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  Let's split the difference and make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $11,000 is a reasonable compromise and better than selling to John for $15,000."
