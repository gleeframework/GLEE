"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

It's always worth exploring if Alice is willing to go lower.  There's no reason to buy immediately at the maximum price you're willing to pay. The next round allows you to see if Alice is flexible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant discount, aiming for a price that's 20% below Alice's initial offer. This shows Alice that I'm serious about getting a good deal, and it gives us a good starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $13,500, which is within my budget and a decent discount from her initial offer. I don't want to risk her getting even more stubborn in the next round and potentially ending up paying $15,000 for the product from John. Accepting her offer allows me to get the product for a good price while also saving some time."
