"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm asking for $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  It's a fair price given the value to me and allows for some room for both of us to make a profit. Let's see if we can agree on this.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,300,000 is a respectable offer, I'm confident the product's true value is higher. Would you consider $1,650,000? This allows us to meet closer to the middle ground.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand you believe the product has a high value, but $1,650,000 is still above what I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000, which is a significant step from my previous offer. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my valuation.  To be frank, I need to get at least $1,550,000 out of this product.  If you're able to meet me at that price, we have a deal.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to get a good price for the product, but $1,550,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,500,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us and would allow us to finalize the transaction. Let me know your thoughts on this offer.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
