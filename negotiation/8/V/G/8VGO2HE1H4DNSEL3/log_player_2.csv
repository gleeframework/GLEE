Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  It's a fair price given the value to me and allows for some room for both of us to make a profit. Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,300,000 is a respectable offer, I'm confident the product's true value is higher. Would you consider $1,650,000? This allows us to meet closer to the middle ground.

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's closer to my target, I'm not ready to accept it yet. I'll make another counteroffer to try and get a better price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand you believe the product has a high value, but $1,650,000 is still above what I'm comfortable paying.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my valuation.  To be frank, I need to get at least $1,550,000 out of this product.  If you're able to meet me at that price, we have a deal.

**Explanation:**

While Alice is getting closer to my desired price, $1,550,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise. If not, I'm still within my budget to buy from John."
