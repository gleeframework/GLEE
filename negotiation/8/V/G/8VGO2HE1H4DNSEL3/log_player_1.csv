Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  It's a fair price given the value to me and allows for some room for both of us to make a profit. Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
