"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,300,000. I believe this price accurately reflects its worth and the benefits it will bring you."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's a common negotiation tactic to begin with an offer significantly higher than your bottom line. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""immense value and potential,""  I aim to anchor Bob's perception of the product's worth at a higher level. 
* **Leaving Room:** While the initial offer is high, it's still within a range where Bob might consider it, especially if he's eager to acquire the product. 
* **Alternative:**  Keeping in mind John's offer of $1,500,000 gives me a strong fallback position. I'm not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $2,300,000 is way above my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $800,000. This is my maximum offer. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While he claims it's his maximum, there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject this offer to signal that I'm serious about a higher price and try to steer the negotiation toward a more agreeable figure."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is simply too far below the product's actual value. To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:**  While I'm rejecting Bob's lowball offer, I'm also demonstrating willingness to negotiate by making a substantial price reduction of $300,000.
* **Hold Ground (for now):** I'm not dropping to a price close to his offer immediately. The goal is to gradually bridge the gap and assess his willingness to move from his stated ""maximum.""
* **Maintain Value Proposition:**  I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify the still-high price. 
* **Time Consideration:** While I have time, each round means potentially missing out on a deal with John. I'll aim for more significant concessions in upcoming rounds if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer, but $2,000,000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking to my maximum offer of $800,000.  If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his initial offer, which indicates a likely bargaining tactic. However, his statement about exploring other options suggests there's some flexibility.  I'll reject again to show I'm firm but will make a more significant move in the next round to test his resolve and potentially break the stalemate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I respect your stance, but I also need to ensure a fair deal. Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,700,000. This is a major concession on my part, and it brings us closer to a workable solution."", 
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Move:** I'm dropping $300,000, a substantial amount, to signal my willingness to negotiate and incentivize Bob to move from his fixed position.
* **Middle Ground:** This price is still above my minimum but puts us closer to the middle ground between our initial positions. 
* **Time Pressure:** We're past the halfway point, and I need to encourage a decision from Bob. This offer aims to accelerate the process.
* **Alternative in Mind:** I'm keeping John's offer in mind. If Bob remains inflexible, I might need to walk away and take the guaranteed $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your effort to find a compromise, but $1,700,000 is still out of reach for me. I'm sticking to my maximum offer of $800,000. Let's see if we can finalize this deal, or I'll need to move on to other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob is entrenched at $800,000, and I've shown significant movement without any reciprocation. This suggests he might be anchored to his initial offer and hoping I'll cave under pressure.
* **Time Sensitivity:** With only a few rounds left, I need to apply more pressure.  
* **Calculated Risk:**  I'll make a final significant concession next round. If Bob doesn't budge, I'll walk away and take John's guaranteed offer. 
* **John as Leverage:** The threat of accepting John's offer is now real and might push Bob to negotiate more seriously."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I've shown considerable flexibility to make this deal work. However, I need to see some movement on your end. This is my final offer: $1,600,000.  If you're unable to accept this, I'll have to proceed with another buyer who's prepared to meet my asking price."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm clearly stating this is my last concession, creating a sense of urgency.
* **Slight Concession:** I'm dropping another $100,000, but it's a small amount, emphasizing I'm nearing my limit.
* **Leveraging John:** I'm explicitly mentioning John's offer to signal I'm not bluffing and have a viable alternative.
* **High Stakes:** This offer is designed to elicit a clear response from Bob, pushing him to either accept a reasonable price or walk away."
