{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This price is a compromise between your minimum desired price ($15,000) and Bob's perceived value ($8,000). It's high enough to potentially be attractive to Bob, while still giving you a significant profit. 
* **The message:** It's friendly and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob, making the offer more appealing.

**Important Note:**  This is just the first offer. You'll need to be prepared to negotiate further based on Bob's response and potentially even switch to selling to John if the negotiation with Bob becomes unproductive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within a certain budget. Can you meet me at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than Bob's initial valuation, it's still significantly lower than your minimum desired price of $15,000. Accepting his offer would leave you with a significant loss.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:**  You should make a counteroffer to Bob, likely somewhere between $9,000 and your initial offer of $12,000. This will show you're willing to negotiate but also that you're not willing to give up a lot of profit.
* **Consider John:** Keep in mind that selling to John for $15,000 is always an option if the negotiation with Bob becomes too difficult or time-consuming."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  The price of $10,500 is a compromise between your previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. It shows you're willing to negotiate but still maintain a reasonable profit margin. 
* **Message:**  The message remains friendly and focuses on the value for Bob while acknowledging his budget concerns. 

**Important Note:**  This counteroffer is still well above Bob's initial valuation.  You're trying to find a price point that is acceptable to both parties, but be prepared for further negotiation.  If Bob continues to push for a price you're not comfortable with, remember that you can always choose to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500. Could you consider $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,750 is closer to your desired price than Bob's initial offer, it's still significantly lower than your minimum desired price of $15,000.  You're still losing a significant amount of money by accepting this offer. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:**  It's time to counter again.  You can try to meet Bob halfway between his current offer and your previous offer.  A reasonable counteroffer might be $10,000.
* **Consider John:** Keep in mind that selling to John for $15,000 is always an option if you feel the negotiation with Bob isn't going anywhere. 

**Remember:** Your goal is to maximize your profit.  Don't be afraid to walk away if Bob won't come closer to your desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,750 is still quite a bit lower than I can accept. How about we split the difference one last time? I'm willing to go down to $10,000. This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I believe it would still be a great deal for you considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  $10,000 is a compromise between your previous offer of $10,500 and Bob's current offer of $9,750. 
* **Message:**  It emphasizes the value of the product for Bob and frames the offer as a fair compromise. 

**Important Note:**  This is likely your last chance to get a price you're comfortable with from Bob.  If he rejects this offer, you should seriously consider selling to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget at $10,000. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, which is the highest I can go. If you're willing to accept that, I'll take the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,500 is still significantly lower than your minimum desired price of $15,000.  You've already made several compromises, and at this point, it's clear that you're not going to be able to reach an agreement with Bob that satisfies your financial goals.  

Selling to John for $15,000 is the most sensible option. It guarantees you the maximum profit and avoids further negotiation with Bob, who seems unlikely to budge much more."
