"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,500.  That's still a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both be happy with.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price.  While $10,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $10,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a fair deal for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
