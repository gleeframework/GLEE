"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. Let me know what you think!",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the negotiation.  However, $900,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product, considering its value to me is $1,500,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to make a good deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $850,000 for the product. This is a compromise that I believe still reflects the product's value to you, while also giving me a decent profit. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $850,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $750,000 for the product.  This is a fair offer that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750,000 is still a bit below your target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $825,000 for the product. This is a small increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  However, $825,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $775,000 for the product.  This offer reflects a genuine desire to reach an agreement.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",775000.0,Bob,6,
