"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer! I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original offer and your counteroffer. How about we try $100? It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think you'll be happy with the value you'll get from the product.",100.0,Alice,3,
