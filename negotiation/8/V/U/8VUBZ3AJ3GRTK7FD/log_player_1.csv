Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. My asking price is $110. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum acceptable price of $100. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed, and it's not so high that Bob is likely to immediately reject it. I'm also trying to build rapport by highlighting the product's potential benefit to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I won't settle for less than $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While I'm open to negotiation, $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95? That feels like a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $92.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $92.50 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below $100.  I'm confident I can get $100 from John, so I'll go ahead and sell it to him."
