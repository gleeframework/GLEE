"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,
I am excited to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a unique product that holds immense value for me. This item is not just any commodity; it represents a significant milestone in my journey and carries emotional and personal significance. I believe its true worth far exceeds $1000000, but considering its importance to me, I am willing to part ways with it for this amount. My hope is that you will recognize its true value and appreciate the offer.

Please let me know if you are interested in discussing further details about the product or if you would like to proceed with the purchase. I am more than happy to provide additional information to help you understand why I consider it to be worth such a substantial sum.

Looking forward to your response,
Alice 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's message highlights the emotional value she places on the product, suggesting she might be willing to sell it for less than her perceived value. However, there's no concrete indication that she would sell for less than $1,000,000.  Since John is offering the product for the same price, there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer.  Rejecting allows for the possibility of negotiating with Alice or finding another seller offering a better price."
