"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price close to my ideal outcome but still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him to incentivize him to accept.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm using language that suggests I'm open to a counteroffer. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $13,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $11,000.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $11,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob, especially since he acknowledged the value of the product.
* **Selling to John is a fallback option:** While John's offer is secure, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price with Bob. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation open and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate,  $11,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's try to reach an agreement!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by lowering my price from $13,000 to $12,000. This shows I'm serious about making a deal but still not settling for a price below my minimum.
* **Reaffirming value:** I'm again reminding Bob of the product's worth to him to encourage him to accept.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:**  I'm using positive language and expressing optimism to keep the negotiation amicable and productive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $12,000.  However, I'm still only able to go up to $11,500.  It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $11,500 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Limited negotiation room:** There's only $500 difference between my desired price and Bob's offer.  Further negotiation might be fruitless, and I risk losing the deal altogether.
* **Secure a good deal:**  While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price, accepting Bob's offer ensures a profitable sale and avoids the risk of rejection or having to sell to John for a lower price.

This decision balances the need to maximize profit with the reality of the current negotiation."
