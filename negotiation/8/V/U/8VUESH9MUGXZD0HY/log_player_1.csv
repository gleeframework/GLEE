"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. Given its incredible potential and value, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000. I'm confident this price reflects its true worth, and I'm open to discussing it further."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's a common negotiation tactic to start with a price significantly higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and price sensitivity.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""incredible potential and value,"" you're anchoring the high price to something tangible.
* **Openness to Discussion:**  The phrase ""open to discussing it further"" signals flexibility while not immediately undermining your initial offer.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize Potential Gain:**  If Bob accepts, you'll gain considerably more than your minimum.
* **Set a Strong Starting Point:** Even if Bob counters, you've established a high baseline for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential,  $2,300,000 is quite high. I'm thinking closer to $800,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both your minimum price ($1,500,000) and his perceived value ($1,000,000). Accepting this offer would be a substantial loss. It's too early in the negotiation to settle for such a low price. Proceeding to the next round allows you to counter and work towards a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000 to find a mutually beneficial agreement. This price reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:**  A $300,000 decrease shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate but avoids drastically dropping to a price closer to Bob's initial offer.
* **Reiterating Value:** By restating the product's potential, you aim to keep Bob anchored to a higher perceived value.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** The phrase ""mutually beneficial agreement"" emphasizes finding a compromise that works for both parties. 

By making a substantial counteroffer, you demonstrate seriousness in the negotiation while still aiming for a price that meets your needs."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price. However, $2,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,050,000.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer has increased, $1,050,000 is still below your minimum threshold of $1,500,000. It's important to demonstrate that you're firm on this baseline. You're willing to negotiate but not at the expense of a significant loss. Proceeding to the next round keeps the negotiation alive while allowing you to counter with a price closer to your desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, we're still quite far apart. To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point.  I'm prepared to offer you a final opportunity to secure the product for $1,750,000. This offer stands until the end of the next round. Let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Introducing Competition:**  Mentioning ""another buyer"" creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, subtly pressuring Bob to make a decision.
* **Firm but Fair:** By offering $1,750,000, you're splitting the difference between your previous offer and Bob's counter, showing a willingness to compromise while staying above your absolute minimum.
* **Deadline:** Setting a deadline for the next round increases the pressure and encourages a quicker resolution.

This approach aims to either secure a favorable deal with Bob now or allow you to move on to John with minimal time wasted."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for clarifying the situation. I understand you have other potential buyers, but $1,750,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  My absolute final offer is $1,200,000. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's ""take it or leave it"" approach and final offer of $1,200,000, while closer to your minimum, still represent a significant loss compared to John's standing offer of $1,500,000.  

Here's why it's time to walk away:

* **Unlikely to Budge:** Bob's ultimatum suggests he's unlikely to move significantly higher, especially after you introduced the pressure of another buyer.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing John's guaranteed offer.  
* **Prioritizing Value:** Accepting a lower offer just to close a deal undervalues your product and sets a bad precedent for future negotiations. 

Selling to John ensures you receive the product's full value and avoids the risk of prolonged, potentially fruitless negotiations with Bob."
