"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that the product holds value for you. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? That's a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $7,500 is still too low for me. Let's try $8,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.  Let me know if you're interested.",8000.0,Alice,5,
