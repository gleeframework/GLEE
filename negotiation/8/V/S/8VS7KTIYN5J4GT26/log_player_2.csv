"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $900,000 is a good price, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($800,000). Bob has 10 rounds and can always buy from John for $1,000,000.  It makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's offer, but it's still above the product's value to her. This gives Bob room to negotiate further, while also showing he's serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her offer to $875,000, which is only $75,000 more than what the product is worth to her. While Bob can potentially negotiate further, the risk is that Alice will either reject further offers or get impatient and leave the deal.  Since the offer is within Bob's budget and relatively close to the product's true value, accepting it seems like the best strategy to avoid losing the deal."
