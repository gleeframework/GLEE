"Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Bob's Maximum:** Bob is willing to pay a maximum of $15,000.
* **Alice's Minimum:** Alice's minimum selling price is $12,000.
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a $3,000 difference between their valuations, leaving room for negotiation. 

By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Aggressive but Reasonable:** This offer is close to Alice's minimum, but still leaves room for Alice to make a small profit.
* **Encourages Negotiation:** By making a strong counteroffer, Bob shows he's serious about getting a good deal and encourages Alice to negotiate. 
* **Avoids Immediate Rejection:**  A more extreme counteroffer might be immediately rejected by Alice, stalling the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:**  Alice's offer is closer to Bob's maximum, but there's still $1,500 of potential savings available.  
* **Counteroffer is Worth Trying:**  Bob can still try to get a lower price by counteroffering again. 

This strategy balances the risk of losing the deal with the potential for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This offer splits the difference between Alice's last offer and Bob's previous counteroffer. It demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will gauge how committed Alice is to closing the deal. If she rejects, Bob can reassess his options. 
* **Avoiding Stalemate:**  A more aggressive counteroffer might be rejected, leading to a back-and-forth without progress."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Alice's offer is only $250 more than Bob's last counteroffer.  This is a small difference, and the negotiation is likely reaching its end.
* **Potential Loss:**  If Bob rejects this offer and continues negotiating, he risks Alice getting frustrated and walking away from the deal, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price.

While Bob could try to counteroffer one more time, the potential for a better price is limited, and the risk of losing the deal is high. It's best to accept this offer and secure the product at a price that's still within Bob's budget."
