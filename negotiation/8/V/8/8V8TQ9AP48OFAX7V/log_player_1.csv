Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $100 is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This allows for a potential counteroffer from Bob, giving me the opportunity to negotiate further. 
* **Balancing profit and sale:**  While I could ask for closer to my minimum ($120), I want to maximize the chances of Bob accepting the initial offer. A lower price may make him more likely to buy. 
* **Keeping John in mind:** I'm aware that I can sell to John for $120, so I'm not desperate to make a deal with Bob at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to keep my budget under $80. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While I want to make a sale, I'm not willing to go below my minimum value of $120.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I can still negotiate with Bob. I can try to get closer to my minimum value in the next round. 
* **John's offer is secure:**  I have a guaranteed sale with John at $120. This gives me leverage in negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $95?  This still gives you a great price, and I can make a sale."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to my minimum:**  I'm increasing the offer from Bob's $85 to $95, bringing it closer to my minimum of $120.
* **Compromise:**  Offering a middle ground shows willingness to negotiate and find a solution. 
* **Positive framing:**  Highlighting the benefit for Bob (a ""great price"") and the possibility of a sale strengthens the offer. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  By not accepting Bob's offer immediately, I maintain leverage and control in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose $90 as my counteroffer. I believe this price is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $90 is still below my minimum of $120, but it's getting closer.
* **Balancing risk and reward:**  While I could try to squeeze out a few more dollars, there's a risk that Bob might walk away entirely. 
* **Opportunity cost:**  If I reject Bob's offer, I might have to settle for John's offer of $120, which is a lower profit for me.
* **Time and effort:**  Negotiating further might take more time and effort, and there's no guarantee of a better outcome. 

Selling at $90 is a good compromise that balances my desire for a higher profit with the need to make a sale."
