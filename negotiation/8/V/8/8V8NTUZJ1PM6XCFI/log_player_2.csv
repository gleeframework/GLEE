"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get your hands on a product worth $1,500,000 to you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it holds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is higher than her value for the product ($800,000) but significantly lower than your value ($1,500,000).  There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $900,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing that."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value the product holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
