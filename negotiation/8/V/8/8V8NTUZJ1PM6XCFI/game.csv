"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get your hands on a product worth $1,500,000 to you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it holds.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $900,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing that.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value the product holds for you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
