"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If not, we can negotiate down from there.  I'm also keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $800,000, so I don't want to go too low too quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm going to reject it and try to get a better price. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer.  I believe Bob is serious about buying, but I'm still willing to negotiate a bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is getting closer, it's still not quite where I want to be.  I'm going to counter again and see if we can bridge the gap. I'm still optimistic about getting a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm going to counter with $850,000.  This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, but it's still a good price for me, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it.  We're getting close to the point where selling to John becomes the more attractive option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $825,000 is a good deal. It's only $25,000 less than what I could get from John, and I'm not sure if I can get a better offer from Bob in the remaining rounds.  I'm going to accept this offer and close the deal."
