(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is far above Bob's budget.  It's best to reject and see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000} 
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is starting with a significant discount from Alice's initial offer. This shows he's serious about buying but is also trying to set a reasonable starting point for negotiation.  It's a bold move, but could encourage Alice to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting closer to Bob's budget, but he's still $50,000 above John's offer.  It's worth seeing if he can get Alice to come down further.  There are still a few rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000}
