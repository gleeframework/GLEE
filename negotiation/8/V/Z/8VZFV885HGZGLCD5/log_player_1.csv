"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic opportunity, and I'm confident you'll find it highly valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High Starting Price:**  I'm starting high, aiming for a profit while recognizing Bob's potential value. 
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and confident approach helps build rapport.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's worth to Bob, hoping to entice him.

**Strategy:**

This initial offer is a strong starting point. It allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially start the negotiation process. If Bob rejects, I'll need to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer and consider the possibility of selling to John for the guaranteed $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum of $1,000,000, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a more favorable price. 

**Strategy:**

* **Reject and Counter:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm still committed to negotiating a better price. I'll counter with a price that's closer to his offer but still allows for some profit.
* **Assessing the Risk:** I'm aware that selling to John for $1,000,000 is a secure option, but I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob.  

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter with a price closer to $900,000, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'll aim for a price that motivates Bob to continue the negotiation while still safeguarding my own interests."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a slightly higher price to reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. Let's see if we can find common ground! "", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows I'm willing to compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth, emphasizing that my price is still justified.
* **Openness to Negotiation:** I'm phrasing it as a starting point for further discussion, suggesting flexibility.

**Strategy:**

I'm taking a calculated risk by moving closer to Bob's offer, but I believe $1,050,000 is still a good deal for both of us. If Bob rejects, I'll need to decide if I should try another counteroffer or move to John for the guaranteed $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hesitant to accept it.  There's a chance I can push for a higher price, and selling to John for $1,000,000 is still a good backup option.

**Strategy:**

* **Counter Again:** I'll make another counteroffer, aiming for a price slightly higher than Bob's offer. 
* **Assessing Risk:** Each rejection brings me closer to selling to John, but I'm not ready to give up on negotiating with Bob just yet. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter with a price closer to $950,000, perhaps at $975,000.  This will test Bob's commitment to the deal while keeping me in a position to secure a decent profit."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $975,000. This is a fair price that recognizes the value of this product for both of us. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 975000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to compromise, meeting Bob halfway between our last offers. 
* **Finality:** The message emphasizes the potential for closing the deal, encouraging Bob to accept. 
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the price as a fair solution that benefits both parties.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a calculated move. It allows me to secure a price closer to my desired profit margin while potentially pushing Bob to accept before he loses the opportunity to acquire the product. 

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects, I'll need to assess the situation carefully. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a secure option. However, I might consider a final counteroffer at $990,000 to see if Bob is willing to make a small compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $960,000, but that's as high as I can go. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'm only $40,000 away from my desired profit margin, I've reached a crucial point in the negotiation.  The risk of continuing with Bob is high. He's shown a reluctance to budge much further, and I've already conceded significantly. With only 4 rounds left, the likelihood of reaching a significantly higher price with Bob is decreasing. 

**Strategy:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential for a better price with Bob is diminishing, and the certainty of selling to John for $1,000,000 is becoming more appealing.
* **Time is Money:** With each round, the time constraint adds pressure. The guaranteed profit from John provides a more secure and efficient outcome.

**Next Steps:**

While I could continue negotiating with Bob, the time factor and the potential for a stalemate make selling to John the most logical choice. This ensures a substantial profit and avoids further risk."
