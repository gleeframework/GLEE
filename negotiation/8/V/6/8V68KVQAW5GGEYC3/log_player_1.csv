Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $13,000, which is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $13,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  This gives Bob some wiggle room to feel like he's getting a good deal without me having to sell for significantly less than my minimum.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message positive and friendly to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  Great! I've successfully sold the product for a good price.
* **Bob Rejects:** I'll need to assess Bob's counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing to negotiate. If not, I can move on to John and sell the product for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:**  $11,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for Better Negotiation:** While Bob's counteroffer is low, it demonstrates his interest in the product.  I believe there's room for a more agreeable price.
* **Avoiding Selling to John:** Selling to John guarantees $15,000, but I'd prefer to try and get closer to that amount with Bob, if possible. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'll send a counteroffer that's closer to my preferred price point, but still lower than my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $11,000 is a little lower than what I'm aiming for, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $12,000? This would be a good price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm offering $12,000, which is halfway between my previous offer of $13,000 and Bob's offer of $11,000. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate and reach a compromise. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and friendly tone, even though Bob's initial offer was lower than I wanted. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, hoping to influence his decision in favor of a slightly higher price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  Great! We've reached a deal that benefits both of us.
* **Bob Rejects:** I'll need to assess Bob's counteroffer again. If it's still too low, I might consider selling to John, as the risk of further negotiation could lead to a price that's too low for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $12,000 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $11,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** While $11,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, it's still significantly lower than what I'd prefer. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob might result in a lower price that's not worth the effort.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees a profit of $15,000, which is my minimum acceptable price and significantly higher than Bob's current offer.

**Next Steps:**

* **Sell to John:** I'll contact John and finalize the sale for $15,000. It's the most secure way to ensure I get a price I'm comfortable with."
