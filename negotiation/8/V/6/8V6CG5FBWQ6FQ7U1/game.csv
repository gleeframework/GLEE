"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 doesn't quite cover the value I've put into this product.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,100,000? This allows for a fair return for both of us.  Let's find a solution that works for both parties.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $1,000,000 just isn't a viable option for me.  Let's aim for a middle ground.  I'm prepared to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering the value we've both agreed the product holds.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
