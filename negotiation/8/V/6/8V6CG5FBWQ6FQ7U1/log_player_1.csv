Round 2
Bob's offer:

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 doesn't quite cover the value I've put into this product.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,100,000?

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $1,000,000 just isn't a viable option for me.  Let's aim for a middle ground.  I'm prepared to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering the value we've both agreed the product holds."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still thinking $1,000,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,025,000, but no higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000

``` 
At this point, it's likely that Bob is unlikely to go higher, and you've already lowered your price significantly. It's better to secure a sale at $1,025,000 than risk further negotiation and potentially ending up with John's offer of $800,000."
