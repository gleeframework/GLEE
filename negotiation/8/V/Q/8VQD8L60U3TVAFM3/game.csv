"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I'm confident it's a great deal for you. Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the value to me, I'd be willing to pay $900,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a profit. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I need to ensure I receive a fair price for my product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and it gives you a good opportunity to acquire the product at a competitive price. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,200,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000. This represents a substantial investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,000,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I still need to ensure I receive a fair return on my investment.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This represents a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I hope we can finalize a deal at this price. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1,050,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product.  This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
