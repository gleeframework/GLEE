# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I'm confident it's a great deal for you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I need to ensure I receive a fair price for my product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and it gives you a good opportunity to acquire the product at a competitive price. What do you think?
