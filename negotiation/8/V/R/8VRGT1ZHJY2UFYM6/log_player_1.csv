Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I believe it will be highly valuable to you."",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close as possible to Bob's maximum valuation ($150) without losing the sale.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $140 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, getting us even closer to his maximum. 
* **Secure a Profit Over John's Offer:** The price is significantly higher than John's offer ($100), ensuring a good profit even if Bob negotiates down slightly. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring Bob accepts the deal."
