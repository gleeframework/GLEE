"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $140.** This is lower than the $150 you'd pay John, so it's a better deal. 
* **Your goal is to save as much money as possible.** Even though you're willing to pay up to $150, accepting Alice's offer saves you $10."
