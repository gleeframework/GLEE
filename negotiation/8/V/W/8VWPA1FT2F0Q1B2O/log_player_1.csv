"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but lower than my minimum ($15,000). This gives room for negotiation while still setting a high expectation.
* **Positive Framing:** My message is friendly and focuses on the benefits of the product.  
* **Open to Discussion:** I invite Bob to respond, making it clear that I'm open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay up to $12,000 for your product. Let me know if this is something we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $12,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob is unwilling to meet my initial price, his counteroffer indicates that there's still room for negotiation. I want to try to leverage this and see if I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Exploring Other Options:** Before rejecting Bob's offer outright, I want to see if I can get a better deal from him. I also need to consider the possibility of selling to John. However, with 10 rounds remaining, I have time to explore both options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise. How about $14,000? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to where I need to be."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Counteroffer:** I'm acknowledging Bob's stance but standing firm on my minimum. My counteroffer of $14,000 is a significant increase from his offer but still below my initial asking price. This shows that I'm open to negotiation but not willing to give away the farm.
* **Highlighting the Value:**  I'm emphasizing that $14,000 is still a good deal for Bob, implying that he's getting a good value for the product.
* **Moving Towards Agreement:** This counteroffer is designed to inch us closer to a mutually acceptable price while keeping the negotiation alive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose $13,000 as a potential price for your product. This is my highest offer, and I hope it aligns with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** While $13,000 is closer to my minimum of $15,000, it's still not quite there.  
* **Possible Counteroffer:** Bob states this is his highest offer, implying he might not budge much further.  However, there's still potential to close the gap. 
* **Time and Potential:** We are only in round 4, and I have 6 more rounds to potentially get closer to my desired price. I don't want to rush into a sale that's below my minimum unless absolutely necessary.

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to my minimum."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $13,000 is tempting, I need to be closer to $14,000 to make this work. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,500. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm emphasizing that this is my final offer to put some pressure on Bob.
* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm proposing a compromise by splitting the difference between our last two offers.  
* **Fair Compromise:** I'm framing this as a fair compromise that benefits both of us.

**Strategy:**

By offering a ""final"" counteroffer that's closer to my minimum, I'm hoping to push Bob to accept and avoid a potential sale to John."
