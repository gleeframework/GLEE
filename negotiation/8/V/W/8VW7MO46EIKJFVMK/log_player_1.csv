Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you have leverage. Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit margin.
* **Justification:**  The message hints at the product's value without revealing your bottom line. This might pique Bob's interest and justify the higher price.
* **Leaving the Door Open:** The message ends with an open-ended question, encouraging Bob to engage in negotiation rather than just giving a flat rejection. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate down if Bob shows resistance, but always stay above your minimum acceptable price of $10,000."
