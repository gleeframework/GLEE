Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. My asking price is $10,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000 is a good starting point:** It's higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000, giving me room to negotiate.  
* **Positive and friendly message:** It's important to be personable and create a positive atmosphere for negotiation.

**Why not start at $12,000?**

While my minimum is $12,000, starting that high might scare Bob off immediately.  It's better to start with a reasonable offer that leaves room for both of us to find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than Bob's initial offer of $8,000, it's still below my minimum of $12,000. I'm not ready to settle yet.  I'll counter with a higher price to see if we can find a more mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a bit higher.  How about $9,500? It's a fair compromise, and it would give you a good value for the product."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a reasonable increase:** I'm raising the price slightly, but not drastically, to show I'm willing to negotiate.  
* **Maintain a positive tone:** I'm emphasizing the ""fair compromise"" to keep the negotiation amicable. 
* **Highlight the value:** I remind Bob of the product's value to encourage him to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to make a profit, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. How about we meet in the middle again, but this time at $9,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,250 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my minimum of $12,000.  I've already countered twice, and it seems like Bob is unwilling to budge much further.  I don't want to risk a lengthy negotiation and potentially lose out on a better deal with John. Therefore, I'll take the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
