"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,450,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a little high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,100,000."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential and the value it brings. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $1,300,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is coming down, but there's still room for negotiation. We'll counter with a price closer to our target."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $1,175,000 and call it a deal?"",
""product_price"": 1175000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a price that works.  However,  $1,175,000 doesn't reflect the value of what you're getting.  Would you consider $1,250,000? This is a very competitive offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to her value, but we're still within a reasonable negotiating range. We'll hold our ground a bit longer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, it seems like we are getting close. I'm willing to move up slightly.  How about $1,200,000?"",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

We're now offering a price equal to Alice's value for the product. It's a strong offer, and she may accept it. If she rejects it, we'll need to decide how much more we're willing to concede to avoid going to John."
