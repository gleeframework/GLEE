"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, considering the value you'll be getting. Let's see if we can find common ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500. Can we compromise at that price?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we split the difference and go with $10,800? It's a fair price considering the value you'll be getting. Let's make this deal happen!",10800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,500, but no higher. Can we meet at that price?",10500.0,Bob,6,
