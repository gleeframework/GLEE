Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $9000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still aiming for a price closer to $8,500.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,750?  This is a fair compromise and allows us to both close the deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $9250 as a final compromise. This is a fair price that allows us to both walk away happy. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You are still aiming for a lower price. While you're getting closer, you can still try to negotiate further. You have more rounds left, and there's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for me.  Considering the product is worth $10,000 to you,  I'm willing to go up to $8,900 as a final offer.  This is a good deal for both of us and lets us close the deal."", ""product_price"": 8900}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $8900 is still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $9100. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both make a good deal.  This is my final offer, and if we can't reach an agreement, I will have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice is getting closer to your desired price, but the negotiation is taking longer than expected, and you have fewer rounds left. You've already reached your maximum acceptable price, and it's likely Alice won't go lower.  Buying from John is the most prudent decision, ensuring you get the product within your budget and don't risk losing more time."
