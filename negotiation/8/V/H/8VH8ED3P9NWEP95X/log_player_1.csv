Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,075,000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $1,075,000 is a fair price for the product. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,075,000 and $1,112,500. Let's try $1,093,750. What do you think?

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum.  I'm going to reject it and counter with a price slightly higher than his last offer.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement in the remaining rounds."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. We've reached a point in the negotiation where it seems unlikely I can get a price closer to my desired value.  While I would prefer to get more, I'd rather secure a sale than risk losing out completely."
