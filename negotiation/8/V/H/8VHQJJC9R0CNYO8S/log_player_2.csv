"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's room for negotiation.  Bob should try to get a better price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.  This counteroffer is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit.  It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's desired price. It's better than John's offer, but Bob should continue to negotiate to try and get a lower price. He can still make a counteroffer and attempt to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to meet Alice halfway. This counteroffer is a compromise between his previous offer and Alice's current offer. It's still a good price for Bob, and it might be appealing enough for Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob would prefer a lower price, Alice's offer of $925,000 is getting closer to his desired price.  It's still significantly lower than John's offer of $1,200,000.  At this point, it makes sense for Bob to accept the offer and secure the product at a reasonable price. Further negotiation may not yield a significantly better result, and the risk of losing the deal to another buyer is increasing."
