"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100.  This is a reasonable starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80 but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'll see if Bob is willing to bite."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $80 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not going to settle for it right away.  I want to see if I can get a bit more. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $90. This is still a fair amount higher than Bob's offer of $80, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. Hopefully, we can find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $85 is getting closer to my desired price and it's more than what John is offering.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
