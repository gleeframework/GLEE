Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than its true value for me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $1,000,000 is still too low, but it's a good starting point for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I am too.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm tempted to accept Bob's offer, I'm going to try to get a bit closer to my target. $950,000 is still a significant loss from my minimum, and I have a few rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,025,000? This way, we can both walk away satisfied. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where I'm not sure I can get a better offer from Bob.  He's still significantly below my minimum, and I've already made several concessions.  To ensure I get the most for the product, I'm going to sell it to John for $1,500,000."
