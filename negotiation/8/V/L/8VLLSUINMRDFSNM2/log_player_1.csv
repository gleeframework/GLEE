Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting high, at $11,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but it gives me some room to negotiate. I'm confident that I can get a better price than what John is offering.  I'm prepared to go down in price, but I will be monitoring the situation closely and will likely  sell to John if I think I won't get a better deal from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,500 is better than what John is offering, I think I can get a bit more from Bob. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to his $9,500 offer, but I'll still aim for a price closer to my $10,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm countering with $10,500. This is a bit lower than my initial offer but still leaves some room for negotiation. I believe this is a fair price considering Bob's offer and my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping for a bit more, $9,800 is very close to my target and significantly better than John's offer. Further negotiation may lead to a slightly better price, but the risk of Bob walking away or the deal dragging on makes this a good time to close the deal."
