"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the potential in this product, $1500000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a significant discount, but I still believe the product's value is higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1200000. This is a fair price considering the product's unique features and potential returns.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
