Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential worth to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $1,250,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its significant benefits."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since the product is worth considerably more to Bob ($1,500,000) than your minimum acceptable price ($800,000), starting high gives you negotiation room.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique"" nature and ""significant benefits"" of the product helps justify the high asking price.
* **Targeting Bob's valuation:**  The price of $1,250,000 leaves a good portion of the potential value for Bob, making it more likely he'll accept while still securing a substantial profit for you.
* **Backup option:** You have a guaranteed sale at $800,000, so you have leverage to aim higher with Bob. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your profit and increasing the chances of Bob accepting the offer."
