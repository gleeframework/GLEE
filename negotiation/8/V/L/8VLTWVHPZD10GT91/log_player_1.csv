Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a reasonable starting point,  above my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a premium, but I'm prepared to negotiate down if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

$10,000 is far too low for me.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm going to counter with $17,000. This is still a significant profit for me, but it's a compromise from my initial offer.  Hopefully, Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's counteroffer of $12,000 is still too low for me. While I could continue negotiating, I'm not confident that I'll get a higher price from Bob.  Jhon is offering a guaranteed $15,000, which is a much better outcome for me."
