"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product at a competitive price. I believe it's a great investment for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and it's a better deal than buying from John."
