{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I've chosen a price of $10,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum. This allows room for negotiation and gives me a strong starting point.
* **Enthusiastic message:**  My message is positive and emphasizes the product's value. This builds a sense of interest and might encourage Bob to consider a higher price.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for Bob to counter, indicating flexibility in the price. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while also being open to a negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $10000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $7500 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $7,500 is above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, I believe I can get a better deal. 

* **Negotiation opportunity:** Bob has shown interest in the product, so there's potential to negotiate a higher price.
* **Counteroffer potential:**  I'm confident I can counter with a price closer to my desired range. 

I'll proceed to the next round and send Bob a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is still a great price for the product, and it's a good compromise for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm countering with $9,000, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. 
* **Positive message:** I'm keeping the conversation positive by acknowledging Bob's offer and framing my counteroffer as a win-win situation.
* **Compromise:**  By offering $9,000, I'm showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired range. 

This counteroffer allows me to continue the negotiation while maintaining a strong position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,500 is still below my ideal price, it's significantly higher than my minimum of $8,000 and very close to the price I'd get from John. It's a good deal given that Bob is showing a strong interest in the product and the negotiation has been progressing.  

By accepting Bob's offer, I can avoid further rounds of negotiation, saving time and effort, and secure a price that is close to my desired range."
