"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than Alice's perceived value of the product. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that is closer to Alice's perceived value of $1,000,000. This aggressive counteroffer sets the stage for negotiation and puts pressure on Alice to consider a lower price. It also leaves room for further compromise if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still higher than what Alice values the product at. Bob can continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price, possibly closer to $1,200,000, as his initial counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer slightly from the previous round, but still remaining below Alice's current offer of $1,350,000. This shows Alice that Bob is serious about negotiation but is also willing to compromise. This counteroffer gives Bob a better chance of getting a price closer to his ideal while also signaling his intent to reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob would prefer a lower price, Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is now within Bob's budget and represents a significant savings compared to buying from John for $1,500,000. Further negotiation might lead to a lower price, but the risk of losing the deal to John or further negotiations dragging on outweighs the potential for additional savings.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a good price while minimizing risk."
