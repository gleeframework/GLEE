Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

This offer is strategically chosen:

* **High but not outrageous:**  $1,400,000 is a significant amount, but still leaves room for Bob to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Above your minimum:**  It's above your $1,000,000 minimum, ensuring you profit.
* **Leaves room for counteroffers:**  This allows for a back and forth, potentially leading to a higher final price.

By starting high, I'm setting the tone for a potentially lucrative negotiation. I'll be ready to adjust my offer if Bob counters, but ultimately my goal is to get as close to $1,500,000 as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is a decent amount, it's still far below what the product is worth to Bob. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to settle for such a low offer so quickly. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise:

* **Lower than my initial offer:**  It shows I'm willing to negotiate and come down from my initial price.
* **Still above Bob's offer:**  This keeps the pressure on Bob to increase his bid.
* **Not too far from my minimum:**  This ensures I don't lose too much potential profit.

By offering $1,350,000, I'm hoping to find a middle ground and secure a price that's closer to what the product is truly worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is moving closer to my ideal price, $1,250,000 is still not enough. I'm confident that I can get closer to my target by continuing to negotiate. There's always a chance that Bob will eventually accept a higher price, especially if he realizes he's risking losing the product entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

This counteroffer is designed to be my final offer before I consider selling to John. 

* **Slightly lower than my previous offer:**  Shows I'm willing to compromise but not at a significant loss.
* **Still above Bob's offer:**  Maintain pressure on Bob to increase his bid.
* **Close to my minimum:**  If Bob rejects, selling to John becomes more tempting.

I'm hoping this offer will convince Bob that it's better to close the deal now than risk losing the product altogether."
