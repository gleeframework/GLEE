"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm looking for $200 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $200, significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn more.
* **Friendly Approach:** I'm using a friendly tone to create a positive atmosphere for the negotiation. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm explicitly saying ""Let me know what you think,"" which signals I'm open to counteroffers and willing to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $180. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $180
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is close, but I'm aiming for more.** While $180 is better than $150 (John's offer), it's still less than my initial asking price and leaves room for me to potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **Negotiation is key:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially get a better price. There are still 8 rounds left, so I can afford to be patient and see if Bob is willing to come up."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a bit more than $180. How about $190?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 190} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm countering Bob's offer with a price of $190. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to meet him halfway. 
* **Focus on Fairness:**  I emphasize ""a fair price for both of us"" to remind Bob of the mutual benefit of a deal. 
* **Continuing Negotiation:**  I leave the door open for further discussion, hoping to reach an agreement quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about $175? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $175
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still aiming higher:** While $175 is a good price, it's still a bit lower than my initial asking price and leaves room for further negotiation. 
* **Patience is key:** With several rounds remaining, I can afford to be patient and try to squeeze out a few more dollars.  
* **Counteroffering:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counteroffer again and hopefully reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. How about we split the difference and go with $182.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 182.50}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Splitting the difference:**  I'm offering to split the difference between my last offer ($190) and Bob's current offer ($175). This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting fairness:**  I emphasize ""a fair price for both of us"" to reinforce the idea of a mutually beneficial deal.
* **Closing the deal:**  I'm aiming to close the deal in this round, as we're getting close to a price that both parties might find acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can go up to $182.50. How about $180, and if you throw in some extras or a discount, I'll consider paying the full price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $180
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to my target:**  While $180 is still less than my initial asking price, it's very close to my desired range and significantly better than John's offer. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  With only 4 rounds left, the risk of losing this deal to John is increasing. It's better to secure a good price now than risk getting a lower offer in the future or losing the deal entirely. 
* **Potential for extras:** Bob is open to extras or discounts, which opens up an opportunity to increase the value of the deal without lowering the base price.  

By accepting this offer, I secure a good price for the product and can potentially even add value to the deal through extras."
