Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a profit. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is designed to:

* **Maximize your profit:** It's much higher than Bob's perceived value, allowing you to make a substantial gain.
* **Be attractive to Bob:** $1,400,000 is still significantly less than what you would get from John, so it's a potential bargain for Bob. 
* **Maintain a backup option:** If Bob declines, you're still guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, which is your minimum acceptable price.

Remember, this is just a starting point. You can adjust the offer price based on your assessment of Bob's potential willingness to negotiate."
