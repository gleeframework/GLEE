{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a price I'm comfortable with. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is a significant profit for me and still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Attractive to Bob:** $10,000 is a good deal for Bob compared to his $8,000 valuation, making it more likely he'll accept.
* **Leaves Room for Negotiation:**  This offer allows for a counteroffer from Bob, which could lead to a mutually beneficial deal. 
* **Alternative Option:**  If Bob rejects, I have a fallback option with John, ensuring I can secure at least my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the effort, but I am only able to pay up to $8,000 for the product. I hope this revised offer works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $8,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  While I could sell to John for $12,000, I still have the option to negotiate with Bob.  There's a chance he might be willing to raise his offer slightly.
* **Strategic negotiation:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to maintain control of the negotiation and potentially secure a better price. 

I will proceed to the next round and counter Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by lowering my price from $10,000 to $9,500, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. 
* **Fair offer:** $9,500 is still a good profit for me, while remaining within a reasonable range for Bob.
* **Maintain pressure:** By not accepting his initial offer, I'm showing that I'm not desperate to sell and that there's a possibility of walking away. This creates pressure on Bob to consider my counteroffer. 
* **Keep John as an option:**  If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I can still sell to John, ensuring I don't lose out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your position, but I am still unable to pay more than $8,000 for the product. I hope you can consider this lower price, as it is within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No further room for negotiation:**  Bob has consistently refused to budge from his $8,000 offer, making it clear that further negotiation is unlikely to be successful. 
* **Significant loss:**  Accepting Bob's offer would result in a loss of $4,000 compared to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Guarantee a profit:**  Selling to John for $12,000 ensures that I secure my desired minimum profit and avoid a substantial financial loss. 
* **Time is valuable:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob would be a waste of time and might not result in a better outcome. 

I'm choosing to sell to John to guarantee my profit and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
