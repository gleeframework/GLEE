"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,000,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $800,000. This product is worth a lot to me, but I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $800,000. I believe the product's value is worth more than that. Would you be willing to meet me at $950,000?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice.  I'm still aiming for a price closer to $850,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment. How about we meet at $925,000? I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while also being reasonable for you. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,
