"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I know it's a bit lower than your initial price, but I'm really interested in making a deal. Can you meet me in the middle at $1,050,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not comfortable going that low.  $1,050,000 is closer to what I'm looking for.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,150,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a good deal for you considering the value of the product.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,112,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still be getting a good deal.",1112500.0,Alice,5,
