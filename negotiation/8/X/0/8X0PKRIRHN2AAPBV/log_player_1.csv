Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 14500} 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. However, this price is still significantly lower than my minimum value, allowing me to potentially earn a good profit while still having room to negotiate if Bob counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,500 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still in a better position to potentially increase the price further. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $14,000, which is still a bit higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise while aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is now getting too close to my minimum value, and I'm not confident I can push him much higher.  Considering the risk of further negotiation and potential stalemate, it's more advantageous to sell to John at this point. The $15,000 offer from John guarantees a profitable deal and avoids the uncertainty of further bargaining with Bob."
