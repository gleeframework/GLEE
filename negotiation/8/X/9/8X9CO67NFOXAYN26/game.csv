"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $13,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,500.  Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $12,500 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $13,250. This is a great compromise, considering its value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",13250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. Let's split the difference. I'll pay $12,750.  This would be a fair deal for both of us.",12750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your proposal, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. However, I'm still not willing to go below $13,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll sell it to you for $13,500. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
