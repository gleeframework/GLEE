""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment. I'm asking for $1,400,000. Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."",

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed buyer in John, the goal is to maximize your profit. Bob's perceived value is significantly lower than yours, but there's room to negotiate above his valuation.
* **Strategic Starting Point:**  Starting with a price close to your guaranteed offer ($1,500,000) would likely scare Bob away. Offering a price slightly below that gives the impression of a deal while still exceeding Bob's perceived value.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price higher than his initial $800,000 valuation. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:**  This strategy assumes Bob is a rational negotiator. If he's known to be extremely price-sensitive or unwilling to negotiate, a lower initial offer might be necessary.
* **Time Sensitivity:** If you need to sell quickly, adjusting the price downwards might be necessary to secure a deal with Bob."
