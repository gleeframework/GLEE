"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. Given its value and quality, I believe it's worth $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
You want to save as much money as possible, and $120 is still too high. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. While I think the product is great, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be open to $105?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your perspective, Bob. Let me think about it for a moment. I believe we can find a middle ground. How about I offer the product for $115 this time? It's still above your initial suggestion but closer to what you're willing to pay. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $115 is closer to your goal, you can still try to get a better price. You're not in a rush, so it's worth seeing if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, I'm still not quite there yet. How about we split the difference and settle on $110? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you've made a good effort to meet in the middle. Let me consider this further. How about we set the price at $112 for the product? It's slightly higher than your last offer but still reasonable. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While you want to save as much as possible, $112 is a good price considering the previous rounds. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but it's still within your budget and you're likely to get a better price than buying from John."
