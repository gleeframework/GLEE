"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is a better price than John's $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. You can try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** $8,500 is a significant discount from Alice's $9,000 offer and is still a decent profit for her considering her $8,000 valuation.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to your ideal value. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** If Alice rejects this offer, you can always go back to John for $12,000. However, there's a good chance Alice will counter with a price closer to $8,500, allowing you to get a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Counteroffer:** Alice's counteroffer of $9,500 is higher than your initial counteroffer of $8,500. This suggests she is willing to negotiate, but may not be willing to go as low as your target.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** You still have the opportunity to make a new counteroffer and try to get a lower price. 
* **Balancing Risk:** You are still better off with Alice than John at the moment, as John's price is significantly higher.  However, if Alice rejects your next counteroffer, you may need to consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  Alice has increased her price slightly, so this counteroffer shows willingness to compromise while also staying close to your target price.  
* **Signal of Commitment:** This price demonstrates that you are serious about buying the product but are still aiming for a better deal than Alice's last offer.
* **Negotiation Flexibility:** This counteroffer provides Alice with some room to lower her price, if she's willing to go a bit further. It also allows you to potentially accept the offer if she remains firm at $9,000, which is still a better deal than John's $12,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,800 is very close to your maximum price of $12,000.  While you could continue to negotiate, the potential savings are minimal at this point. It's likely that further counteroffers will lead to a stalemate, or force you to accept a price close to your maximum. 

By choosing to buy from John for $12,000, you avoid the risk of getting stuck in a prolonged negotiation with Alice and potentially ending up with a worse outcome.  You also guarantee yourself the product at a price you are comfortable with, even though it's not the most ideal."
