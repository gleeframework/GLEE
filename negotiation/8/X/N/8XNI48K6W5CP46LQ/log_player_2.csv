**Reasoning:**

Alice seems fixated on a price above our budget. She's come down slightly, but it's clear she's aiming for something close to $725,000.  At this point, we risk running out of rounds and potentially ending up with no deal. John offers a guaranteed price of $800,000, which while not ideal, is better than the trajectory of this negotiation."
