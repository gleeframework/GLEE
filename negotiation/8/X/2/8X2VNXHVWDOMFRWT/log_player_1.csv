"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
