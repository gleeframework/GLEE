""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and while my minimum selling price is $1,200,000, I'm willing to offer it to you at $1,150,000. This offer stands for 24 hours.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible, but still entice Bob to buy.
* **Understanding Bob's Value:**  Knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000 gives Alice room to negotiate above that price.
* **Time Constraint:** Adding a time limit creates a sense of urgency and might encourage Bob to act quickly. 

**Why this strategy?**

This offer aims to strike a balance:

* **Attractive to Bob:** The price is significantly lower than Alice's minimum and gives Bob a potential profit of $150,000 if he leverages the product effectively. 
* **Profitable for Alice:**  While not the absolute maximum, $1,150,000 is a substantial profit, and the risk of Bob rejecting and going with John is mitigated."
