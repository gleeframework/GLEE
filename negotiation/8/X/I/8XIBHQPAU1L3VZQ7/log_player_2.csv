"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a valuable addition to your collection, and I'm willing to make a one-time offer of $950,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is quite high ($950,000). While it's below your maximum budget, you know you have a backup option with John for $1,000,000. There's a good chance you can negotiate a better price with Alice or even get John to come down a bit."
