Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I think you might be interested in. I'm asking $150 for it. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, there's no reason to offer the product to Bob for less. You start at the highest price and see if Bob bites. If he rejects, you haven't lost anything."
