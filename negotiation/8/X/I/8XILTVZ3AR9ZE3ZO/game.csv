,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering our conversation, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $925,000.  It's a fair price considering the product's value, and it's also closer to my budget.  Let's see if we can make this work.",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $925,000. Considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it, I'm willing to offer it to you for $975,000. This is a compromise that I'm willing to make to find a mutually beneficial price.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $950,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your proposal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. I've already compromised significantly, and I'm not willing to give up any more value. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to offer it to you for $975,000, and I'm willing to throw in some additional features that will increase the product's value. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair deal.",975000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate the additional features you're offering, but  $975,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to offer $960,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to my target.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",960000.0,Bob,8,
