Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm not comfortable with the price of $2,000,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,750,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

**Reasoning:**  Bob is unlikely to go much higher and we have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000. It makes the most financial sense to cut our losses and sell to John.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks a lower final sale price."
