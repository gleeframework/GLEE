"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm not comfortable with the price of $2,000,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the value.  To be fair to both of us, I can come down to $1,750,000. This feels like a reasonable compromise.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,750,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
