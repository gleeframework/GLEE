Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might be getting a deal if he can bring the price down a bit. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, Alice subtly reinforces that the price is justified.
* **Alternative Option:** By alluding to selling it ""publicly,"" Alice subtly reminds Bob that he might lose the opportunity if he doesn't act.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the asking price is $15,000, Alice's language (""What do you think?"") suggests she's open to discussing the price.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider seriously."
