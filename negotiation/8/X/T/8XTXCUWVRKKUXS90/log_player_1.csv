Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 12000} 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation and potential profit for me.  If Bob rejects, I can always go back to John for the guaranteed $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $9,000. While it's closer to my minimum, I can still try to get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

I'm countering Bob's offer with $10,500. This is still a good deal for me, as it's above my minimum, and it's more than likely to be accepted by Bob, who's already shown a willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $9,500.  While it's not my ideal price, it's significantly better than the $8,000 he was initially willing to pay. It's also close to my minimum, so I don't want to risk losing the deal and potentially having to settle with John for $15,000."
