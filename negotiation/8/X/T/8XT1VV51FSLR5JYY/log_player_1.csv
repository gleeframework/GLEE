{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is higher than Bob's perceived value but still significantly lower than your minimum value. This creates room for negotiation while ensuring you don't immediately lose out on a potential deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what the product is worth to me. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? It's a fair price for both of us and gets this deal done."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $9,800, but that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would ideally like to get closer to my desired price, Bob's offer of $9,800 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value.  It's a reasonable compromise, and I don't want to risk losing him as a buyer altogether."
