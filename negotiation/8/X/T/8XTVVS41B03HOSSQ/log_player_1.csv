Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a more reasonable price given the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's too low.  While I want to make a deal, I won't settle for a price significantly below what I believe the product is worth. I'll try to counter and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,000,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is still a fair price given the value we both recognize in this product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. This price is still a good deal for both of us, considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again.  While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for that price. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,150,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it reflects the value you place on this product. Let's work together to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be at $1,075,000 or lower. I'm thinking $1,075,000 is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can get to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John.  While I'm not thrilled about accepting John's offer, it's clear that Bob is unwilling to come up to a price that's reasonable for me. With only a few rounds left, I don't want to risk ending up with nothing."
