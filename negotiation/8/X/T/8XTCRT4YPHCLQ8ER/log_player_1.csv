Send your offer to Bob.","```json

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $120 is better than $100, I'm confident I can get closer to my target price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $120 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $125?  That's a fair compromise, and we can both get what we want."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd be willing to pay $115 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $115 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $115 is just a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  How about $120?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm close to walking away, but I really want this product. I'll meet you at $118. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. Can you accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $118
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tricky situation. While I'd prefer to get closer to my target price, Bob's offer is close enough, and there's a risk of losing the deal entirely if I keep rejecting.  Accepting his offer guarantees me a sale and a profit."
