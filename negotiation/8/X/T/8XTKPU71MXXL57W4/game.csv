"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value.  Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we settle around $1,100,000?  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $1,100,000 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits us both. ",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,250,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a slightly better price. Would you consider $1,175,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $1,175,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about we settle at $1,225,000?  This price is a good compromise for both of us, and allows us to close this deal.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close!  I appreciate you working with me. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,200,000? This seems like a fair price we can both agree on.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
