Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
