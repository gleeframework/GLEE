"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'd really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $140. It's a fantastic deal, as you know it's worth $150 to you! Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While Alice's offer of $140 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $150 from John if you reject her offer. There's a chance Alice might come down on her price, allowing you to save even more money."
