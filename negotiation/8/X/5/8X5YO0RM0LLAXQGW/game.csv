"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we try $9,800? I'm willing to meet you halfway from $10,000, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",9800.0,Bob,4,

"I'm still not convinced that $10,500 is a good deal for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Please consider this my final offer.",10000.0,Bob,6,
