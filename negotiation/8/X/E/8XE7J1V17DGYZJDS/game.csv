"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe I can't afford $11,000 at this time. Would you consider lowering the price to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your situation. While I'm happy to negotiate, I can't go as low as $10,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? I believe this price still represents a good value for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Considering my budget constraints, would it be possible to lower the price to $10,200? This would allow me to make a purchase while staying within my financial limits.",10200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While I recognize your budget constraints, $10,200 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this sale worthwhile.  Let's compromise once more.  I'm willing to come down to $10,350.  This offer is a fair compromise, and I believe it represents a good value for you.  What do you say?",10350.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your position, Alice. I really value the product, but I'm afraid I can't meet your current offer. Could you consider bringing the price down to $10,250? This would help us reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",10250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting close. While I appreciate your offer, $10,250 isn't quite enough for me. To make this work, I'm willing to lower my price to $10,300. This is a final compromise on my end. I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.",10300.0,Alice,7,

"Thank you for your patience, Alice. I've been considering our previous discussions and would like to propose a price of $10,200 for the product. This figure represents a fair compromise between our interests. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you.",10200.0,Bob,8,
