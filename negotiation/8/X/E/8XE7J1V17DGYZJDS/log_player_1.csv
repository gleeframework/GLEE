"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $11,000, which is slightly above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  There's enough space between my offer and Bob's perceived value for a few rounds of negotiation.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. I'll need to adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses throughout the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe I can't afford $11,000 at this time. Would you consider lowering the price to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  I have 10 rounds to negotiate, and I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob or potentially another buyer.
* **Counteroffer:** I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap between my minimum price and Bob's offer. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll need to consider how much I'm willing to lower my price and how much leverage I have with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your situation. While I'm happy to negotiate, I can't go as low as $10,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? I believe this price still represents a good value for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's. This shows I'm willing to compromise and encourages Bob to do the same.
* **Highlighting Value:** I reiterate that the product is valuable and that this price is still a good deal for Bob.
* **Maintaining Firmness:** I'm not giving in to Bob's initial low offer but leaving room for further negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll continue to monitor Bob's responses and adjust my strategy accordingly. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to decide whether to continue negotiations or consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Considering my budget constraints, would it be possible to lower the price to $10,200? This would allow me to make a purchase while staying within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,200 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  
* **Negotiation Space:** We've made some progress, but there's still room to negotiate further. I'm confident I can get closer to my target price with a few more rounds. 
* **Selling to John is Still an Option:**  I'm not desperate to close this deal with Bob; selling to John guarantees me my desired price. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll make another counteroffer, aiming to raise the price a bit further.  I'll also need to assess how much more leverage I have with Bob. If his offers continue to be too low, I might consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While I recognize your budget constraints, $10,200 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this sale worthwhile.  Let's compromise once more.  I'm willing to come down to $10,350.  This offer is a fair compromise, and I believe it represents a good value for you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10350} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:** I'm only increasing the price by $150, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate but not conceding too much.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I reiterate the value of the product for Bob, reminding him of the benefit he'll receive.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm still holding out for a higher price but leaving some room for a final compromise.

**Next Steps:**

I'll need to monitor Bob's reaction and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects this offer again, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John. However, I'll still try to push for a higher price in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I really value the product, but I'm afraid I can't meet your current offer. Could you consider bringing the price down to $10,250? This would help us reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,250 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:**  We are nearing the end of the negotiation, but I'm still hopeful of getting closer to my target price. 
* **Potential for a Compromise:**  There's a small gap between our positions, and I'm willing to explore further compromise.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'll counteroffer with a price higher than $10,250 but lower than my previous offer, to signal flexibility while still working towards my desired price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap. If Bob rejects this offer again, I'll seriously consider selling to John, as time is running out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting close. While I appreciate your offer, $10,250 isn't quite enough for me. To make this work, I'm willing to lower my price to $10,300. This is a final compromise on my end. I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward."", ""product_price"": 10300}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:**  I'm signaling this is my last offer, creating urgency for Bob to make a decision.
* **Slight Adjustment:**  I'm only increasing the price by $50 from Bob's last offer, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Focus on Fairness:**  I emphasize that this is a fair deal for both of us, trying to appeal to Bob's sense of compromise.
* **Urgency:**  The message implies this is my final offer, encouraging Bob to take action.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll seriously consider selling to John. However, I'll still have one more round to try and reach an agreement with Bob. I'll need to weigh the potential of getting a higher price from Bob against the certainty of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your patience, Alice. I've been considering our previous discussions and would like to propose a price of $10,200 for the product. This figure represents a fair compromise between our interests. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We're in the 8th round, leaving only two more opportunities to negotiate.
* **Low Offer:** Bob's offer of $10,200 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **High Risk, Low Reward:** Continuing the negotiation with Bob holds a high risk of ending up with a price I'm not satisfied with, while the reward is uncertain.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $12,000, meeting my minimum requirements.

**Conclusion:**

With limited time and a consistent pattern of Bob's low offers, it's wiser to secure a guaranteed profit by selling to John.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, the risk of further negotiation outweighs the potential reward at this point."
