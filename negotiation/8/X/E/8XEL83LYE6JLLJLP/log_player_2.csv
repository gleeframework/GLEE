"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, as it's worth $15,000 to you. If you're not interested, I'll be selling it to someone else for $12,000, so you'd be missing out on a good opportunity. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to bluff you.  You know you have a backup option to buy the product from John for $15,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price or she might stick to her word and you can buy it from John."
