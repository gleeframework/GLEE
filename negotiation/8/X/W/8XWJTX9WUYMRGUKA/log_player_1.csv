{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth $180. Would you be interested in buying it for that price?"", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 

This is a starting point.  I'm offering a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This strategy gives Bob a reason to negotiate, and allows for potential gains for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I believe I can offer you $120 for it. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not going to accept an offer that's significantly below my minimum. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer.  I appreciate you're interested in the product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $120 is just too low for me.  How about $160?  That's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 160}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $160 is a bit out of my budget, I would like to propose $140 as a compromise. Thank you for considering my offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $140 is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  $140 is still a little low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $150? That's a fair price for both of us, and it's the lowest I can go."", ""product_price"": 150}
