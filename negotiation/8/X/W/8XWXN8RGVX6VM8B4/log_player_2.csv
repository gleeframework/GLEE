"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it gives us both room for a good deal.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,150,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,200,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's worth. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.
