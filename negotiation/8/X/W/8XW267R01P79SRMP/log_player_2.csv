Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that 1200000 is your maximum budget, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least 1600000 for the product. Can we discuss further?

You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer is still above your budget, but she seems willing to negotiate further.  It's worth trying to counteroffer again."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,600,000 is closer, it's still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go to $1,400,000, which would be a good compromise for both of us.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you at 1500000, which is the lowest I can go. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's final offer is still above your budget. While it's tempting to try to negotiate further, you've already made multiple counteroffers and she's clearly not willing to go lower.  It's best to stick to your budget and buy the product from John for $1,200,000 to ensure you get the best deal."
