Explanation:

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, his ""final offer"" is still significantly less than what John is offering. It's unlikely Bob will budge much further, and accepting his offer would mean leaving a substantial sum on the table.  It makes the most financial sense to cut off negotiations with Bob and take John's guaranteed offer."
