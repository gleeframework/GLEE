"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product.  However, $150 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $110 for it.  Let me know what you think.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking for a good price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $130. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $130 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to go up to $115.  This is my final offer, as I'm happy to purchase from John if we can't agree on a price.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $115 is your final offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $125. This is my best offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",125.0,Alice,5,
