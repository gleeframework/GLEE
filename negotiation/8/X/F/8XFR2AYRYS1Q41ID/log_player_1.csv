Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $80. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
