"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $700,000. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $850,000. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to a tight budget, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm counteroffering $825,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. If you're not comfortable with this, I'll have to consider other options.",825000.0,Alice,5,,

"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $825,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. I'd be willing to offer $780,000 as a final attempt to find a price that works for both of us.  If we can't agree on this, I might have to explore other options. ",780000.0,Bob,6,,
