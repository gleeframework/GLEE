"Alice, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $85.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer you the product for $105. It's a fair price considering the value it brings.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still above my budget. How about we split the difference and settle at $95? I'm confident we can both be happy with that price.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $105 was still a bit too high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you the product for $100. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value it brings.",100.0,Alice,5,
