# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been designed to meet your needs effectively. It comes with a variety of features that ensure efficiency and durability. I believe it would be a valuable addition to your collection. Would you like to purchase it for $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, there's no reason to accept it immediately. You don't know Alice's minimum acceptable price. By rejecting the offer, you can attempt to negotiate a lower price and potentially save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the features you mentioned, but $100 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 80}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I am willing to negotiate further. How about we agree on a price of $95 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $95, which is still higher than your initial counteroffer of $80.  However, it's getting closer to your budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your desired price of $80."
