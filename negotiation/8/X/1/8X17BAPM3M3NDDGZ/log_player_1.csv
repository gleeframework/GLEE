"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is a better offer than Bob's initial offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate and a guaranteed sale to John for $12,000, so I'm not in a rush to settle for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,500? It's a fair compromise that gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,200, but that's the highest I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,200 is getting closer to my target, I still have 6 rounds left.  I'm not willing to settle for anything less than $10,000 yet, especially since I have a guaranteed sale to John for $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,200 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little to $9,750.  This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to walking away, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can go up to $9,500, but that's my final offer. If you can meet me at that price, I'll make the deal 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has come up to $9,500, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  We've reached a point where his offers are not significantly improving, and I have the option to sell to John for a much higher price.  With only 4 rounds remaining, I'm confident that John is a better choice."
