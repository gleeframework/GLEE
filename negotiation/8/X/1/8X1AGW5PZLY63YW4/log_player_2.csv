"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit your business. Given its value, I propose a price of $10,000. This is a special offer considering its worth to you and our commitment to helping you achieve success. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $10,000 is a good price, it's still above the product's worth to Alice. Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your commitment to helping me succeed. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to negotiate further. Considering the value of the product to you, I'd like to offer it to you for $9,500. I hope this aligns better with your budget while still ensuring we receive a fair return for our product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is very close to Bob's counteroffer of $9,000.  It's a good deal for Bob, as he's getting the product for less than what he's willing to pay John.  There's a good chance that further negotiation might bring the price down further, but it's not worth the risk of losing the deal, especially since there are only 7 rounds remaining."
