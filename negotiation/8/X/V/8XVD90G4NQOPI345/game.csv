"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but that price feels a little high.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While I'm eager to find a deal that works for us both, $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we settle on $1,225,000? It's a strong offer, and I'm confident it represents a fair deal for both sides.",1225000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  To be frank, I have a budget in mind, and to make this work, I'd need to be closer to $1,050,000.  Would that be something you'd consider?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but I need to be mindful of the value this product holds.  Let's try this â€“ $1,175,000.  This splits the difference and represents a significant profit for you, while still being reasonable for me.",1175000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we make this really simple - $1,100,000, and I promise to be a customer for life on this product line.  That's a win-win in my book!",1100000.0,Bob,6,
