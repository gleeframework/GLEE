Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product is incredibly valuable, and I'm offering it to you first.  I'm asking for $1,000,000. Given its potential, I believe it's a very fair price. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1000000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations above your minimum price to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:**  Providing a reason for the high price (""incredibly valuable"", ""fair price"") can make it seem more reasonable to the buyer.
* **Open Communication:**  Phrases like ""What are your thoughts?"" invite Bob to engage in the negotiation process.

By starting high and being willing to negotiate, Alice maximizes her chances of getting a price closer to Bob's maximum valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below both your minimum price ($800,000) and his own stated value for the product. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're aware of the product's worth and are willing to negotiate for a better deal.  You still have the option to sell to John for your minimum price, so there's less risk in continuing the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This feels like a reasonable compromise.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** Coming down $100,000 shows Bob that you are willing to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Stay Above Minimum:** The $900,000 counteroffer keeps you well above your minimum acceptable price while still allowing room for further negotiation.
* **Seek Compromise:** Framing the offer as a ""reasonable compromise"" encourages Bob to view the negotiation process positively."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still above my target price. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $750,000. This would be a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving closer to a more reasonable price, his offer of $750,000 is still below your minimum acceptable price of $800,000. At this point, continuing the negotiation with Bob carries the risk of:

* **Further Price Reductions:** Bob might be unwilling to go much higher, and further counteroffers could lead to a price you're not comfortable with.
* **Stalled Negotiation:** The back-and-forth could continue without reaching an agreement. 

You have a guaranteed offer from John for $800,000, which meets your minimum. Accepting John's offer ensures you receive a fair price for the product without further risk or delay."
