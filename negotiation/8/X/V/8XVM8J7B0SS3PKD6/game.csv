"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is above your budget, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the benefits the product will bring to your business.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Bob,6,
