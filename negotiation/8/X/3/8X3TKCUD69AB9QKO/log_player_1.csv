Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $18,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $17,750. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

**Reasoning:**

While I'd ideally like to get closer to $18,000, Bob has presented this as his final offer. Accepting $17,750 is still a significant profit above my minimum, and it avoids the risk of him walking away altogether.  Continuing to negotiate might backfire and lead to a worse outcome."
