"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations.  What are your thoughts?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $18,000. I believe this product has great value, but I'm on a budget and need to be mindful of my expenses.",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget concerns. However, $18,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $19,000? This reflects the true value of the product while still providing you with a reasonable deal.",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $17,500 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you're offering.",17500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see that we're getting closer.  While $17,500 is still a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to be flexible to close this deal.  How about $18,500? This is a final offer, as I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us.",18500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $18,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $17,750. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",17750.0,Bob,6,
