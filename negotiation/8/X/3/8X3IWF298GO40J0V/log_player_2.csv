**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  Since you're aiming to save as much money as possible, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer allows you to potentially secure a lower price."

# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to pay a lower price, but I'm still willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get this amazing product at a discounted price, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering its value to you. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your counteroffer, but there's still room for negotiation.  You're still aiming to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer allows you to potentially secure an even lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my initial asking price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a decent profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,075,000, which is only $50,000 more than your last counteroffer.  While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will become more resistant or even withdraw her offer completely.  Buying from John for $1,200,000 would cost you significantly more.  Therefore, accepting Alice's offer at $1,075,000 is the most sensible choice, securing the product at a price that is still a good value for you."
