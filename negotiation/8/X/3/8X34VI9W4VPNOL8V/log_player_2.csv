"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this offer reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,500 is below your maximum budget, it's still higher than John's offer of $15,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can proceed to buy from John and save $500."
