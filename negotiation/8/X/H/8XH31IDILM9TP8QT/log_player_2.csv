"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $120. Given its value to you, this seems like a fair deal that would benefit both of us. Please let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

While $120 is a better price than John's $150, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell and the product's value to her is significantly lower than her asking price. By rejecting this offer, you might be able to get a better deal from Alice."
