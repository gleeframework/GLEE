"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. I believe it will be highly beneficial for you.  I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $20,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $20,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to start the negotiation by offering a significantly lower price than Alice's initial offer. This sets the stage for potential compromise and hopefully brings Alice closer to Bob's target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $17,000 is closer to Bob's target price, it's still higher than his budget. Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price, as Alice has shown a willingness to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $17,000 is still too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $15,500. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his target price, but he still needs to be careful. By offering $15,500, he's pushing for a price that is just above his budget, leaving room for a slight concession if needed.  He's also signaling that this is his final offer, adding some pressure to Alice to accept."
