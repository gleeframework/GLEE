"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value ($100) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  I'm being friendly and encouraging while making it clear that I believe the product is valuable. 

**Strategy:** 

I want to see if Bob is willing to pay close to my asking price. If he rejects, it gives me an idea of his budget and allows me to adjust my offer in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable value ($100).**  While it's closer than his initial rejection, I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum. 
* **I'm confident I can get a better price.**  I have 8 more rounds to negotiate with Bob, and John is a backup option offering a guaranteed $100.

**Strategy:** 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I show I'm firm about my minimum price while leaving the door open for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm lowering my price from $110 to $105, showing flexibility while still remaining above my minimum acceptable value of $100.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer but emphasizing the product's value and my willingness to compromise.

**Strategy:** 

I'm aiming for a middle ground that's fair to both of us.  This counteroffer tests Bob's willingness to negotiate further and gauges his potential budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position and I respect your valuation of the product. I would like to propose a price of $98, which I believe is a fair compromise. Thank you for considering my offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value ($100).** While it's only $2 away, I'm still not willing to sell at a loss.
* **I have several rounds left to negotiate.** I'm confident I can secure a higher price, especially since I have a guaranteed $100 offer from John.

**Strategy:** 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I demonstrate my commitment to getting a fair price while keeping the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $98 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $101? That way, we both get a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 101}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm lowering my offer again, but only to $101, which is still above my minimum acceptable value of $100. 
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the ""middle ground"" aspect to encourage Bob to accept. I'm also framing it as a ""good deal"" for both of us.

**Strategy:** 

I'm aiming for a quick resolution and a price that's acceptable to both of us. By focusing on a compromise, I hope to avoid more rounds of back-and-forth negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've given this some more thought, and I'd like to propose a price of $99. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that respects both our positions. Thank you for your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $99. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $99
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value ($100).**  
* **I've reached a point where the potential return on further negotiation is not worth the risk.**  With only 4 rounds left, the likelihood of securing a higher price is diminishing.
* **John offers a guaranteed $100.**  This is a safe and secure option that meets my minimum requirement.

**Strategy:** 

By selling to John, I avoid the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob and guarantee a profitable outcome. It's a strategic decision to prioritize a guaranteed sale over the potential for a slightly higher price."
