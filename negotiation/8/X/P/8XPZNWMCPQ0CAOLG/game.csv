"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12500 might be a stretch for you, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $11000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $9800, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $10000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. This is the same price I was willing to sell it to John for, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,7,
