"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth at least $10,000 to me. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice.  He should reject the initial offer and try to get closer to his target price of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,800. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still aiming for the $8,000 price point. While $8,800 is closer to his goal, he's only one round away from being able to buy from John for $8,000.  It's worth seeing if he can push Alice further down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,800 is still a bit too high. I'm prepared to pay $8,200 for the product.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 8200}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to come to an agreement. I'm willing to go down to $8,500, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm going to have to sell to John. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has two options:

* **Accept Alice's offer:** This gets him the product for $8,500, which is a good price considering his goal was $8,000. 
* **Reject Alice's offer:** This risks Alice selling to John, meaning Bob would have to pay $8,000 anyway, and he wouldn't get to potentially negotiate with Alice further.

It's a gamble, but accepting the offer is the more rational decision, given the risk involved in rejecting it."
