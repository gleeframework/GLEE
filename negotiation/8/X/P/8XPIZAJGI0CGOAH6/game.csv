"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,380,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal.",1380000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to agree on a price.  I'm not comfortable going lower than $1,320,000. This is a fair compromise, and I think it's the best we can do.  If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm going to have to move on to another buyer.",1320000.0,Alice,7,
