Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to get close to my minimum price of $150. Bob knows the product is worth $80 to him, so I'm giving him some room to negotiate. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to counter with a lower price, but I want to see if he's willing to pay more for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$100 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for such a low offer. I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum, hoping Bob is willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm offering $130, which is still above my minimum but significantly lower than my initial offer.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go below my minimum price.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob and lead to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $110 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my acceptable range. Since John is willing to pay my minimum, I'll choose to sell to him and avoid further negotiations. It's a safer bet and guarantees I get my desired price."
