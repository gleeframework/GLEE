"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $9,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the value it brings to your business.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle at $9,750?  I believe that's a fair offer reflecting its value to me.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,250. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to me is $8,000. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair return on my investment.",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I respect your position on the product's value.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $9,900. I'm hoping we can find a middle ground here and make a deal.",9900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $9,900. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'm counteroffering at $10,225. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me is $8,000.",10225.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, we're getting close.  I'm willing to come up slightly to $10,000.  This is a very fair offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product.  What do you say?",10000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $10,000. I'm willing to make a final concession and offer it to you for $10,100. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to me is $8,000. I hope we can come to an agreement.",10100.0,Alice,9,
