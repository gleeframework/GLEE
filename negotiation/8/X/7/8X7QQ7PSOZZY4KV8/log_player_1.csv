"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my target price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, I need to stay closer to $1,000,000 to make this deal worthwhile. Let's split the difference.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,025,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still going to reject his offer. I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're close, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,010,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to gain something from this deal.  Let's finalize this."", ""product_price"": 1010000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,010,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $980,000 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough decision, but with only four rounds left and Bob's offer hovering around $980,000, I'm not confident we'll reach my desired price point. Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees I get my minimum and avoids any further risk of losing out on a better deal."
