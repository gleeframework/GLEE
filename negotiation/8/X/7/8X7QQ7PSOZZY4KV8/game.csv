"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, I need to stay closer to $1,000,000 to make this deal worthwhile. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,025,000.

"Bob, I understand we're close, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,010,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to gain something from this deal.  Let's finalize this.",1010000.0,Alice,5,
