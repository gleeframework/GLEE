"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, but I'm open to negotiating. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

This is a good starting point.  $1,200,000 is a decent discount, but there's likely room for more negotiation.  Let's see if we can get a better price."

Alice's offer:

I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise.

Alice has moved closer to your price point, but there's still room to negotiate. We'll see if we can get that price down even further."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us, and I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,075,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:

At this point, it seems like we've reached a good compromise with Alice. The price is significantly lower than John's offer and the difference between our counteroffer and Alice's offer is minimal. Accepting this offer will save us a significant amount of money."
