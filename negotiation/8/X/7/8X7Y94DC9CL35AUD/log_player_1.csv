Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $100. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's valuation is key:** You know the product is worth $120 to Bob, giving you significant negotiating power.
* **Aiming high but staying reasonable:** Offering the product at $100 is a good starting point. It leaves you room to negotiate down if needed while still securing a significant profit above your minimum ($80). 
* **The John factor:**  While you have a backup buyer, aiming for a deal with Bob is optimal as he values the product more. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters."
