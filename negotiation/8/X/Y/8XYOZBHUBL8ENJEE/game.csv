"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing an initial price of $20,000. What are your thoughts?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $17,000. Can you consider that?",17000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $17,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,500? ",18500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider $17,500? It's a compromise between our previous offers, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",17500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. $17,500 is close, but I need to get at least $18,000 for this product. I'm confident it will be valuable for you, so I'm hoping we can make this work.",18000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to walking away, but I really like the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $17,500 and $18,000. How about $17,750?",17750.0,Bob,6,
