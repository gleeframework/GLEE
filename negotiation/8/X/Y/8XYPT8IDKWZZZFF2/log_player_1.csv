Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $115. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $100, but it also leaves room for negotiation.  Since Bob values the product at $120, there's potential for a deal that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is close to my ideal price, and it's still higher than my minimum. I'm willing to accept it to avoid further negotiation and the risk of losing the deal altogether."
