"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment. I propose a starting price of $1,500,000. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I'm willing to pay $1,500,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, however, the value of this product is truly significant and I can't let it go for less than $1,350,000.  This is a very competitive price for what it offers.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has significant value, but I still think $1,350,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be mindful of my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and want to find a solution that works for both of us. While I'm confident in the product's value exceeding your offer, I'm willing to meet closer to your price.  My final offer is $1,250,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it reflects the true worth of this opportunity.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,150,000, but I don't think I can go any higher than that. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I need to stay within my budget.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
