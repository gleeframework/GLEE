"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $7,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $7,500 is a good deal, it's still above Bob's target of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  It's a great product, but $7,500 is a bit out of my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $7,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $7,200. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $7,200 is still below Bob's maximum budget of $8,000, making it a worthwhile purchase.  While Bob could potentially try to negotiate further, accepting this offer allows him to secure the product at a price lower than John's, minimizing risk and saving some money."
