Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal for you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

This offer starts by offering the product slightly above Bob's perceived value ($80). This increases the likelihood that Bob will accept the offer while still giving you a good profit margin. By mentioning it's a ""great deal"" for Bob, you attempt to subtly influence his perception of the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Although $90 is more than Bob's perceived value, it's still less than your minimum acceptable price of $100.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and allows you to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95? This is a great deal for you as the product is worth much more to me."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $85. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $85 is below your minimum acceptable price of $100. While continuing the negotiation might yield a slightly better offer, there's no guarantee.  Selling to John for $100 guarantees you meet your minimum price and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
