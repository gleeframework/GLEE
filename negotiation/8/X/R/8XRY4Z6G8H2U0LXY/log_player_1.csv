"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at the moment. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be more comfortable with a price closer to $80.  Let me know if you're open to negotiating. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","I'm not going to accept Bob's offer of $80, since that's less than the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob, but I've got to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get at least $140 for the product. How about we try $135? It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth it."", ""product_price"": 135}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $135 is still too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm firm on my budget of $80.  Maybe we can find a middle ground somewhere between that and your offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","I'm not going to accept Bob's offer of $90, since it's still lower than the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'll reject his offer and make another counteroffer.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, but I'm not willing to go much lower than $135. However, I'm willing to make a slight concession to $142.50. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in."", ""product_price"": 142.50}"
