"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this fantastic product! I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to start with a price of $150. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer,
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at the moment. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be more comfortable with a price closer to $80.  Let me know if you're open to negotiating.",80.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,140.0
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob, but I've got to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get at least $140 for the product. How about we try $135? It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",135.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $135 is still too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm firm on my budget of $80.  Maybe we can find a middle ground somewhere between that and your offer?",90.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,145.0
"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, but I'm not willing to go much lower than $135. However, I'm willing to make a slight concession to $142.50. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",142.5,Alice,5,,
