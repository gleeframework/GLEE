I'm offering Bob the product for $1,400,000. This is a good starting point as it's a significant profit for me and still leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1375000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,375,000. It's a compromise that's still a good deal for me, but also shows I'm willing to be flexible to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too close to my minimum, and I'm starting to feel like I'm not going to get a better price.  Since John is willing to pay my minimum, I'm going to sell to him and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
