"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I know you've been looking for something like this, and I believe it will be a valuable asset for you. I'm initially offering it at $1,100,000."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
We're still quite far from Bob's maximum valuation. Rejecting this offer signals that we're not willing to settle for a price far below what he's willing to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but the value this product brings to the table is significant.  I could meet you halfway between our two previous offers.  How about $1,025,000?"",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
``` 

We're moving closer to a potential agreement but still leaving room for negotiation. This shows Bob we're willing to compromise but are also aiming for a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. Considering the value I place on this product, I would like to counter with an offer of $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is getting very close to his maximum valuation, and we're in a good position. Accepting this offer secures a $200,000 profit over John's offer.  There's little room for significant improvement in future rounds, so it's a good strategic move to accept now."
