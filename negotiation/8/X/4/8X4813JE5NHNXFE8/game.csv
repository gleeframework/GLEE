"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is far below what the product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted.",750000.0,Bob,4,
