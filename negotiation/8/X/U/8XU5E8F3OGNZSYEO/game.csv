"I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? I'm thinking more along the lines of $14,000.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. While I can't go as low as $14,000, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This product is truly top-of-the-line and I believe it's a very fair price.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $17,000 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider $15,500? I'm really interested in this product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",15500.0,Bob,4,
