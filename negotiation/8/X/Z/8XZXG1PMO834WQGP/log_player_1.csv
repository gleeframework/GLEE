Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $11,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'd be happy to pay $9,500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $9,500 is close to my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell. I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. However, $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $10,500 for this.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,500 is still a little high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  This is my final offer.  Let me know if it works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer of $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price. It's a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to another buyer."
