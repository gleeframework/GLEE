"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $20,000.  This is a good starting point as it gives me room to negotiate and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level. If he rejects, I can lower the price in subsequent rounds.  However, I'm also keeping in mind the $15,000 offer from John, so I won't go too low too quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my starting price, and it's also below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm going to counter with $17,000.  This is still above Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be more inclined to consider John's offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $15,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I would like to earn more, accepting this offer ensures I get my desired value and avoids the risk of further negotiation.  There's no guarantee that a counteroffer from Bob will be better, and I'm running out of time.  It's also a good idea to avoid a drawn-out negotiation, as this can potentially damage the relationship with Bob, who may be a valuable customer in the future."
