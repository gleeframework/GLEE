"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $900,000, which I think is a fair and reasonable offer considering its worth to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. This product would be valuable to my business, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $700,000. I'm willing to make a compromise and meet you halfway, so I'll offer the product to you for $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you and my minimum price.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but that price is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm serious about purchasing this product, but I need a price that works for both of us. Would you consider $750,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the product's potential.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to invest in it. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, so I'll offer the product to you for $825,000. This is a price that I think reflects the product's value and is closer to your target, while still allowing me to meet my minimum price.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting closer to what I had in mind.  How about we settle at $780,000? That's a fair offer, and it would allow us to close this deal today.",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $780,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll offer the product to you for $812,500. This is a fair price that I think reflects the product's value, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here.",812500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's make this final; I'm willing to offer $790,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's more than fair and reflects the value of the product.",790000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to meet you at $790,000. I'm willing to make one last offer, and I'll meet you at $815,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",815000.0,Alice,9,
