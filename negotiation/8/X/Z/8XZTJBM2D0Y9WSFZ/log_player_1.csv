Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer slightly higher than what you're willing to accept. This provides room for negotiation and makes it more likely Bob will counter with an offer closer to your desired range.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $140, even if Bob counters with a lower offer, there's a good chance you can negotiate a price above your minimum of $120.
* **Awareness of Bob's Value:**  While you know Bob values the product at $100, he doesn't know you have a guaranteed buyer at $120. This puts you in a stronger negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $90 is significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $120. Accepting would result in a loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Bob's offer suggests he's interested, but there's a large gap to bridge. Rejecting this offer opens the door for counteroffers and finding a compromise.
* **Backup Option:** You have the security of selling to John for $120. This allows you to be firmer in your negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand where you're coming from, but $90 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $125?"", ""product_price"": 125}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This classic negotiation tactic can feel fair to both parties.  
* **Above Minimum:** $125 is still a profitable price for you, exceeding your minimum acceptable price by $5.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer helps gauge how serious Bob is about the product and how much negotiating room exists."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from $125, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable:** While not ideal, $110 is still above your minimum acceptable price of $120, securing you a profit. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Further negotiation might only yield small increments, and there's a risk of Bob losing interest altogether.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids potentially lengthy negotiations and secures the sale."
