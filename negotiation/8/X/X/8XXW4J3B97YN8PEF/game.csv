"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the value, the price of $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. Could you do $1,650,000? I'm willing to be flexible if we can find a middle ground.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,650,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking $1,550,000 is a fair price. I'd like to make a deal at this price.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
