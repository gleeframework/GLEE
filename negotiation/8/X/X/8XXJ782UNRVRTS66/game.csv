"I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1800000 for it. Can we meet in the middle?",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. I understand your perspective, but $1800000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway - let's settle on $1900000. This would ensure a mutually beneficial transaction.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1750000, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet in the middle again?",1750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget in mind.  However, $1750000 is unfortunately too far below the value of this product.  Let's try to find a compromise closer to the middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1850000.  This price would reflect the product's worth while also allowing us to close this deal.",1850000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns about the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1725000, but I think that's the absolute maximum I can pay. Can we meet in the middle again?",1725000.0,Bob,6,
