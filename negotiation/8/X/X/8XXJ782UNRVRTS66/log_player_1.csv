"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for a price of $2,000,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset.  Let's discuss this further and see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum, knowing that I can negotiate down. This allows for room to maneuver during the negotiation process.
* **Focus on Value:**  My message emphasizes the potential value of the product to Bob, hoping to pique his interest. 
* **Open to Discussion:**  I invite Bob to discuss and potentially negotiate a deal that works for both of us.

**Important Note:** This is just a starting point.  I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and how the negotiation unfolds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1800000 for it. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Close:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate a higher price. By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially close the deal for a better price.
* **Time Remaining:**  With 9 rounds remaining, I have time to explore further negotiations and potentially secure a higher price. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counteroffer Bob with a price higher than $1,800,000 but lower than my initial offer. This will demonstrate my willingness to compromise while still aiming for a profitable sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,800,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway - let's settle on $1,900,000. This would ensure a mutually beneficial transaction."", ""product_price"": 1900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by moving from my initial price of $2,000,000 to $1,900,000. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still aiming for a profitable deal.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing $1,900,000 as a ""meeting in the middle"" to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:**  The message emphasizes that the offer is beneficial for both of us. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully monitor Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he accepts, I'll close the deal. If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1750000, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer is now significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would result in a significant loss for me.
* **Negotiation is Still Possible:** Even though we've had a few rounds of negotiation, there's still room for a compromise. I believe I can push for a higher price by making a counteroffer.
* **Time Remaining:** With 7 rounds left, I have time to try to negotiate a better deal. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum but higher than his offer. I'll try to emphasize the value of the product and the potential for a mutually beneficial deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget in mind.  However, $1,750,000 is unfortunately too far below the value of this product.  Let's try to find a compromise closer to the middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,850,000.  This price would reflect the product's worth while also allowing us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Firm but Fair Price:** I'm counteroffering with a price that's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my previous offer. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate but also maintains my minimum price expectations. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I reiterate the value of the product to justify my counteroffer. 
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** The message emphasizes the potential for a win-win situation with this price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's Response:**  I'll analyze Bob's response carefully. If he accepts, I'll close the deal. If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer and the remaining rounds.
* **Consider John's Offer:** With each passing round, selling to John for $1,500,000 becomes more appealing. If Bob continues to offer prices significantly below my minimum, I might consider accepting John's offer to avoid losing too much money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns about the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1725000, but I think that's the absolute maximum I can pay. Can we meet in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below My Minimum:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  It's clear that we're unlikely to reach an agreement that benefits me at this point.
* **Time is Running Out:** With only 5 rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob is increasing.
* **John's Offer Provides Certainty:**  John's offer guarantees me my minimum acceptable price.  It's a safe and reliable option, especially considering Bob's persistent low offers. 

**Conclusion:**

While I'd prefer to secure a higher price, the risk of further negotiation with Bob and potentially losing more rounds without a deal is too great. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum and eliminates the risk of a failed negotiation."
