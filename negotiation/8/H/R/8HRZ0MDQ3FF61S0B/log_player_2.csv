"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product for a great price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is way above his maximum budget of $12,000.  It makes more sense to counteroffer or explore buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to get a good deal, Bob, but $13,000 is still a bit lower than I'm willing to go. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000.

While $16,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum.  Bob should continue to negotiate by counteroffering or explore buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to make one more concession, Bob. I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000, but I can offer it to you for $17,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value you place on the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in!

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  Alice has come down to $17,000, which is still above Bob's budget.  At this point, it makes more sense to secure the product at a price he can afford."
