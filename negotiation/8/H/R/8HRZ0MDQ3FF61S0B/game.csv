"I'm excited to offer you this unique product for a great price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know if you're interested!",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I'm happy to pay $13,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can make this work.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to get a good deal, Bob, but $13,000 is still a bit lower than I'm willing to go. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the market value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in!",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which I think is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value you place on the product. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to make one more concession, Bob. I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000, but I can offer it to you for $17,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value you place on the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in!",17000.0,Alice,5,
