{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This still represents a significant value for you, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still not high enough. With only 4 rounds left, I don't think I'll be able to reach my desired price.  It's better to secure the guaranteed $8,000 from John than to risk getting a lower offer or ending up with no sale at all."
