"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
You want to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the initial offer and counter-offering is the best strategy.  $120 is still too high for your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $90. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $90 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're still aiming to save as much as possible. While $110 is better than $120, you can likely get it for less.  Rejecting and counter-offering again keeps the negotiation moving in your favor."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go below $105. I think that's a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While you'd love to get it for $100, Alice has been firm. At $105, you're still saving a significant amount compared to John's price and are within your budget. It's time to close the deal!"
