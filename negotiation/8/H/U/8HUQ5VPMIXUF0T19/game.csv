"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for starting the conversation, Alice. While I agree the product is valuable, I need the numbers to work a bit better on my side.  How about  $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand that $900,000 is a bit below my minimum, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. How about we meet at $1,050,000? This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. That discount is helpful, but I'm aiming for something closer to $975,000. Would that be workable?",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I can see you're getting close to my minimum price, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach a deal. However, I need to make sure I'm not giving away too much value. How about we meet at $1,025,000? This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
