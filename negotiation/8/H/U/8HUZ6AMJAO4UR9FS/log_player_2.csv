"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $10,000 to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your desired price point. It's worth exploring if you can negotiate a lower price.  You have room to bargain and potentially save some money."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only willing to pay $10,500 for the product. It's a fair price, considering my budget and the value I place on the item. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,500 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,750. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your desired price, there's still room for negotiation. It's worth seeing if you can push for a lower price in the next round. You're getting close to John's offer, but you're still in a strong position to potentially secure the product for a better price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,625.  This price is fair and allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10625}
