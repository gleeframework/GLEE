Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $9,500. I believe it would be a valuable asset to you, and this is a very competitive price."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($8,000) as possible while still making a significant profit over our minimum ($10,000).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $9,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price, which might still be acceptable to you (e.g., $9,000).
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $10,000 provides a strong fallback position.  You don't *need* to go below $10,000, but it's strategically advantageous to try with Bob first."
