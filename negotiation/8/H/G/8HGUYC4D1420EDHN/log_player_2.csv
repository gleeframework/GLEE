Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 was a bit steep for you, and I appreciate your counteroffer of $1,000,000. However, I'm still a bit above the minimum I'm willing to sell for. I can meet you halfway, so I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I see you're still looking for a good deal. I can understand that $1,100,000 is a bit too high for you, and $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, so I'll come down to $1,075,000. This is as low as I can go, but I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

Alice is clearly trying to meet me halfway and has indicated this is her lowest price.  At $1,075,000, I'm getting a significant discount compared to John's offer. It's time to accept and close the deal."
