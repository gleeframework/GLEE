"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm Alice. I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $20,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $20,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer is better than selling to John for $15,000, but I think I can get more.  I'll counter.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?"", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, Alice.  However, $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you consider $12,000? That's a fair offer considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","This is a tricky one. Bob is coming closer to my minimum, but I think there's still room to negotiate. However, $12,000 is a decent profit, and going lower might upset Bob and risk the deal.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""You drive a hard bargain, Bob!  $12,000 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $14,000 if we can close the deal today.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Alice. How about we split the difference and settle at $13,000? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob is clearly firm on his valuation, and at this point, going back and forth might just frustrate him.  $13,000 is a solid profit, so I'll accept.
