"Hi Bob, I'm Alice. I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $20,000.  What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $20,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, Alice.  However, $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you consider $12,000? That's a fair offer considering the market value.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"You drive a hard bargain, Bob!  $12,000 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $14,000 if we can close the deal today.  What do you say?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Alice. How about we split the difference and settle at $13,000? That's my final offer.",13000.0,Bob,6,
