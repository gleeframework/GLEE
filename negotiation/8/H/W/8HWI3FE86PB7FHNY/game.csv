"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to own it, and I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay around $8,000.  Would that work for you?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $11,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $9,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, this time at $12,000. I think this is a fair price, considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,5,
