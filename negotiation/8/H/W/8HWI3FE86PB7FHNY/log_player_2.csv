Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay around $8,000.  Would that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 8000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11,000. What do you think?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $11,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $9,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me."", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, this time at $12,000. I think this is a fair price, considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**  Alice seems pretty firm on her price. She's now back up to $12,000, which is her starting value.  It's unlikely she'll go much lower. To avoid further back and forth and risk the deal falling through, it's best to take the guaranteed offer from John at $10,000."
