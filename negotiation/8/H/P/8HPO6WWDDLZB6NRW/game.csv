"I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this valuable product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident will bring you significant value. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1,100,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit below your target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,075,000.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1,075,000 is getting closer to what I can afford.  To make this deal happen, I'm willing to offer $1,025,000. This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,025,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,075,000, which is the same price I offered in Round 3. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
