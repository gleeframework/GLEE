"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this valuable product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident will bring you significant value. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above my maximum budget. It's better to reject and see if I can negotiate a lower price.  I'm hoping to get the price closer to my target of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit below your target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,075,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to my target, but it's still above what I'm willing to pay. I'm going to try to negotiate further and see if I can get a lower price. I'm still hoping to secure the product for around $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1,075,000 is getting closer to what I can afford.  To make this deal happen, I'm willing to offer $1,025,000. This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,025,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,075,000, which is the same price I offered in Round 3. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unwilling to budge on her price.  She's offered $1,075,000 twice now, which is still above my comfort zone. At this point, it's not worth continuing to negotiate with Alice.  I'm confident that I can secure the same product from John for a lower price."
