"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $8500. I understand that it's a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $11000 is still a little steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $9500.  This is a fair compromise considering the value we both place on the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your latest offer of $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10500.
