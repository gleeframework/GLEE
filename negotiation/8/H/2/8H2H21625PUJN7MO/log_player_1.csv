{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's high enough that I still make a profit, but low enough that it's enticing to Bob.  I'll be ready to negotiate further if he rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't sell for that price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $950,000,  which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. How about we settle at $900,000? It's a strong offer, and I'm eager to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $900,000 is a good compromise. While it's lower than my initial ask, it's still a decent profit and avoids the risk of him walking away entirely."
