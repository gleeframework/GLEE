"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,150,000. This is a strong opening offer, leaving room for negotiation while still securing a profit significantly higher than my minimum. I believe Bob will find this offer attractive, but it's not so high that it would immediately cause him to reject it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's offer, I'm not willing to accept it yet. I'm confident I can get a better price, as the product is worth more to Bob. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves me with a good profit.  I believe Bob will find this offer appealing, and it's likely he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still not satisfied. There's a significant gap between his offer and what the product is worth to him. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1090000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,090,000. This is a significant concession, but I'm still confident Bob will be willing to pay more. I believe this offer demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still leaving a good profit margin. It's time to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
