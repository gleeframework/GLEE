"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,000,000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This takes into account your budget and still allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's work together to find common ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,125,000 still falls a bit short of my target.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,187,500.  This is a fair compromise, and it would allow us to close this deal.",1187500.0,Alice,5,
