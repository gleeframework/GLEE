,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $12,000 is significantly lower than what I'm aiming for. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is a good price point for both of us. What do you say?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $13,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,250.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's close this deal.",14250.0,Alice,5,
