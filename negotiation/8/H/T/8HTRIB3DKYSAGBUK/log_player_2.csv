"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1000000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm sure you'll see its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always a good idea to start with a counteroffer. You don't know Alice's bottom line, and she might be willing to go lower. This gives you the opportunity to see if you can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price.  It's important to start with a strong counteroffer to show Alice that you're serious about negotiating.  This also leaves room for further negotiations if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay closer to my asking price. Let's try $900000.  This would still be a great deal for you, and we can finalize the transaction quickly. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to my initial counteroffer, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting her offer allows me to continue the negotiation process and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to be close to your asking price, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $800,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal today."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows Alice that I'm serious about purchasing the product, but I'm still looking for a better deal.  The price is a compromise, but it's still lower than her last offer.  This should make Alice consider making a final compromise."
