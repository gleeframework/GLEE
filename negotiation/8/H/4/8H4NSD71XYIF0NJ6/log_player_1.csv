Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant return you stand to gain."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to earn as much as possible. Since Bob values the product at $1,500,000, there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($1,200,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,400,000 leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob while still securing a significant profit margin for you.
* **Strong but Fair:** The message emphasizes the product's value and positions the price as justified. This makes it more likely for Bob to accept without further negotiation.

**Why not aim higher?**

While you could start higher, getting too close to Bob's maximum valuation ($1,500,000) increases the risk of him rejecting the offer outright. This would force you to settle for John's offer, leaving potential profit on the table."
