Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering $15,000 sets a high initial price, leaving room for negotiation. It also signals that you value the product highly.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message conveys that I'm open to negotiation, encouraging Bob to engage. 
* **Plan B:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $10,000 gives me a floor price and the power to walk away if the negotiation isn't fruitful. 

I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response, aiming to maximize my profit while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob is willing to pay the minimum I'm comfortable with ($10,000). However, I believe I can still get a better price. 
* **Potential for a Higher Price:** I'm not sure how much value Bob places on the product, so there's a chance he might be willing to pay more than $10,000. 
* **Negotiation is Key:** Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open, allowing me to see if he's willing to compromise further.

**Next Steps:** I'll send Bob a counteroffer slightly higher than $10,000, aiming to find a middle ground while keeping the potential for a higher profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm happy to negotiate,  $10,000 is a bit too low for me. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $12,500? This price would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a great deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle Ground:**  The counteroffer of $12,500 is halfway between my initial offer of $15,000 and Bob's offer of $10,000. It presents a fair compromise.
* **Positive Language:** The message is positive and focused on finding a solution that works for both of us.
* **Focus on Value:** I reiterate the value proposition of the product to emphasize its worth. 

By offering $12,500, I'm increasing my chances of securing a higher price while also remaining open to further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $12500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to meet me at $11000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:**  Bob has moved closer to my desired price, and $11,000 is only $1,000 less than my last counteroffer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could potentially push for a slightly higher price, there's no guarantee that Bob will agree.  
* **Time Factor:** Continuing to negotiate could drag things out.  
* **Security:**  $11,000 is a solid profit, especially considering my minimum price of $10,000.

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a good price while minimizing the risk of losing the sale altogether."
