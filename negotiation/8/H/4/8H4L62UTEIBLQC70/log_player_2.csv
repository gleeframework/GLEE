"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $10,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, considering the product's value to me is $12,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price that takes into account your valuation of the product, and I believe it's a good compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. $10,500 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $9,750?"",
""product_price"": 9750
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,750 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,250. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me and your valuation of it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated this is her final offer. At this point, her offer of $10,250 is still higher than John's price of $10,000. It's unlikely Alice will go any lower, so it's in Bob's best interest to cut his losses and buy from John."
