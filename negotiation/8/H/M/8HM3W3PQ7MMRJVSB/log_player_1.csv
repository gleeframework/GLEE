I'm offering the product to Bob for $100. This is a reasonable price that allows me to make a profit while still leaving room for Bob to potentially make a good deal if the product is worth more to him. If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell it to John for $80, so I have nothing to lose by trying to get a higher price from Bob."
