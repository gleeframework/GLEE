Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential benefits it holds. Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, I want to start negotiations significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000).
* **Room for negotiation:** The offer of $1,350,000 leaves space for negotiation. This allows Bob to feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to haggle the price down somewhat. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""unique value proposition"" and ""potential benefits,"" I'm subtly anchoring the value in Bob's mind without revealing my absolute bottom line. 

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while still offering Bob a price he might consider, given the right negotiation."
