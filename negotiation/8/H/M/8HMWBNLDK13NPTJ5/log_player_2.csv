"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $88. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $95. This is my final offer, as I'm also considering selling it to another buyer who is willing to pay the full price of $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's final offer is $95, which is still above your budget of $80. Since you have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $80, it's the most financially sensible choice."
