{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm open to negotiating. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer sets a high initial price, but it also acknowledges Bob's potential interest and allows for negotiation.  It's a good starting point, but I'm ready to adjust my offer based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a bit too high for my budget. How about we start at $50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I need to earn at least $150 for this product.  Rejecting his offer and sending a counteroffer allows me to try and reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $50 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make at least $100 to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle at $100?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's valuable Alice, but I'm on a tight budget. Could you do $75? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $75 is closer to my minimum, it's still too low.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground. If that fails, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $75 just doesn't work for me.  How about we split the difference at $87.50?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm willing to let this go for that price."", ""product_price"": 87.50}
