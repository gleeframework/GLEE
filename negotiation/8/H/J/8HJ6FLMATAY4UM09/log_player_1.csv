Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to part with it for $11,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While I could sell the product to John for $12,000, offering it to Bob first at a slightly lower price has the potential to save time and effort involved in finding another buyer.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $11,000 is still a significant profit margin for me ($11,000 - $12,000 = -$1,000, but better than $12,000 - $12,000 = $0). It also provides a compelling discount for Bob, who values the product at $8,000. 
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** By mentioning listing the product publicly, I subtly introduce a sense of urgency and make the offer seem more exclusive.

This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the likelihood of a successful sale to Bob."
