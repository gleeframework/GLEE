Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers and also reflects the value I place on the product. I'm willing to accept a lower price, but I want to see what Bob is willing to pay first.  I'll be watching closely to see if his counteroffer is reasonable, and I'll be prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While $1,200,000 is a decent price, I'm still hopeful I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}

I'm countering with $1,350,000. This is a reasonable compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, while still maintaining a price that reflects the value of the product. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this offer and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to keep pushing for a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is getting close to my minimum acceptable price. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a decent profit.  I'm not willing to risk further negotiation, especially considering the potential to sell to John for a lower price."
