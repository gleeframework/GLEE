"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, however,  the value this product brings is truly exceptional, and $950,000 falls quite short of that.  Would you be willing to consider $1,050,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has value, but I still think $950,000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering $1,025,000. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I have a limit to my budget.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
