While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum value of $15,000. I'll reject this offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."

Bob keeps offering lower prices, and I'm starting to run out of rounds.  While I'd prefer to get a bit more than $15,000, I'm confident that I can get a solid price from John.  He's a reliable buyer, and I'm willing to take the guaranteed $15,000."
