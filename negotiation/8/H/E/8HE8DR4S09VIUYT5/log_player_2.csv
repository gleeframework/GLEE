"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable item. I'm willing to part with it for $9,500. It's a great deal, considering its worth to you is significantly more. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should reject the offer and attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice. However,  $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, given its value to me and your own stated worth. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while I get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,200. It's a fair compromise, considering the value you place on the product and my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a decent profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $9,200 is still a good deal for Bob. It's lower than John's price of $10,000, and it's closer to Bob's ideal price of $8,500. While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject the counteroffer and he'll have to buy from John at a higher price. It's more prudent to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a reasonable cost."
