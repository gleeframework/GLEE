"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $100. It's better to reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You have 10 rounds and John is a backup option, so there's no need to rush into a deal that's not favorable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a relatively aggressive counteroffer of $90.  This is a significant discount from Alice's offer of $150, and it's just below my maximum budget of $100. This is to see if she's willing to negotiate quickly and avoid unnecessary rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $130 is still more than I'm willing to pay. I'm going to continue to negotiate and try to get a price closer to my desired $100 mark. I'm not in a rush, and John is always an option if I can't make a deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $95. This shows Alice that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not going to go much higher.  I believe there's still room for Alice to meet me halfway, as she's likely eager to sell the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $125 is still too high. I'm determined to get the price closer to my $100 limit.  While I could buy from John now, I'm confident I can get a better deal with Alice with more negotiation. There are still 5 rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Explanation:**

This is my final offer. I'm going all-in on my desired price of $100. At this point, I'm willing to walk away and buy from John if Alice doesn't accept.  There's not much room for further negotiation, and with 4 rounds remaining, it's time to see if Alice will meet me halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $127.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $127.5 is still too high. We've reached a point where the negotiation isn't progressing. With only 3 rounds remaining, I'm running out of time to reach an agreement that works for me. It's better to cut my losses and buy from John for $100.  It's a sure thing, and while I'd prefer to save more, it's important to know when to walk away from a deal that's not working."
