"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is simply too low. My minimum price for this product is $105. I'm willing to work with you, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for my product. "", ""product_price"": 105}
