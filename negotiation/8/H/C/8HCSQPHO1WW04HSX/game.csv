"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! While I agree the product is great, $11,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product and you're looking for a fair price. How about we settle at $10,750? That's a reasonable compromise, don't you think?",10750.0,Bob,4,
