"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price that reflects its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  How about $1,150,000? This price still leaves room for you to profit, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you consider $1,075,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer, $1,075,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I will continue to negotiate with him to see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I respect that. But I need to make sure I get a price that reflects the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $1,125,000? This is a fair price considering both our needs."", ""product_price"": 1125000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. It seems like we're getting closer. How about $1,100,000? I'm hoping we can find a middle ground and make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,100,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for that price. I'll see if I can get Bob to go a little higher with my counteroffer."
