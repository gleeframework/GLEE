"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its significant worth while acknowledging your potential for substantial returns. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,300,000 is better than $1,500,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer opens the opportunity to counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  This shows my genuine interest while still allowing for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for presenting your counterproposal. While $1,000,000 is certainly a respectable figure, it doesn't fully reflect the true value and potential this product holds.  I'm confident that its unique benefits justify a higher price point. To move us closer to an agreement, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. I believe this represents a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still not the best deal for Bob. There's still room to negotiate further.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue exploring a lower price through counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to pay $1,100,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it shows my willingness to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to negotiate. Your latest offer demonstrates a clear understanding of the value this product brings. To bridge the gap, I'm prepared to accept $1,150,000. I believe this offer represents a fair and mutually beneficial outcome for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $1,150,000, which is a good price for Bob.  It's still lower than his initial price point of $1,500,000 and leaves him with some wiggle room. While there's always the possibility of pushing for a lower price, accepting the offer at this point minimizes risk and ensures a deal within Bob's budget.  Further negotiation could risk losing the deal entirely."
