"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its significant worth while acknowledging your potential for substantial returns.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  This shows my genuine interest while still allowing for a fair deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for presenting your counterproposal. While $1,000,000 is certainly a respectable figure, it doesn't fully reflect the true value and potential this product holds.  I'm confident that its unique benefits justify a higher price point. To move us closer to an agreement, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. I believe this represents a fair compromise.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to pay $1,100,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it shows my willingness to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to negotiate. Your latest offer demonstrates a clear understanding of the value this product brings. To bridge the gap, I'm prepared to accept $1,150,000. I believe this offer represents a fair and mutually beneficial outcome for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
