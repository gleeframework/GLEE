"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $200 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is far too high.  It's well above your maximum price point of $100.  There's no reason to accept it immediately.  Rejecting allows you to start negotiating and hopefully get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  $200 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a bold move, but it's important to establish your maximum price point early on.  Alice knows you're interested in the product, but this counteroffer shows you're serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $100 is significantly less than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $170? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to your price range, it's still above your maximum limit.  You can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  Rejecting allows you to make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $170 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $120.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal now."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer shows you're willing to compromise but are still holding firm to your price point. You're also highlighting the ""fairness"" aspect, hoping to appeal to Alice's desire to close the deal.  At $120, you're still getting a decent discount compared to the initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but I need to get a fair price for this.  $145 is my final offer. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, you're still within your budget to continue negotiating. You're also not obligated to accept her ""final offer,"" and there's a chance she might budge further.  By rejecting, you can try to get a better price or see if Alice will offer you a lower price without a counteroffer from you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not there. $145 is still a bit high for me. If you're serious about selling, I'm willing to go to $135.  This is a good price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Explanation:**

You're continuing to negotiate, but this time you're raising your offer slightly to show you're serious about making a deal.  The offer is still within your budget and reflects a genuine compromise.  By highlighting the ""good price for both of us"" aspect, you're trying to appeal to Alice's desire for a quick and mutually beneficial agreement."
