"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $950,000, which is a 35% discount from the original price. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While I see the value in the product, $950,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $825,000? I feel that's a fair compromise.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $925,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product's value to you.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your lowest price, but I'm afraid I can't meet that. If you're willing to reconsider and go down to $850,000, I'm ready to close the deal. Otherwise, I might have to explore other options.",850000.0,Bob,6,
