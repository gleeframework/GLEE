"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a good deal, but I have to say that $1200000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1300000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $1250000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. I'm willing to make one more concession to get this deal done. I'll meet you at $1280000, which is the highest I can go. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to sweeten the deal by throwing in some additional perks.",1280000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate the additional perks you're offering, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you at $1275000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're really close to your budget, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going below $1300000. I'm willing to make one more concession to get this deal done. I'll meet you at $1270000, which is the absolute lowest I can go. If you're willing to meet me there, I'll throw in the additional perks I mentioned earlier and make sure the deal is done smoothly.",1270000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1270000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to make one last offer of $1265000. If you're willing to meet me there, I'll consider it a good deal and we can finalize the purchase.",1265000.0,Bob,8,
