Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value and features, I'm offering it to you at $11,000."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While John offers a safe $12,000, there's a chance to earn more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting at $11,000 creates a sense of urgency and exclusivity. It's a significant discount from John's offer, making it tempting for Bob while still providing a good profit for Alice. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** If Bob rejects the initial offer, there's still space to negotiate slightly downwards, potentially reaching a price that's still more profitable than selling to John."
