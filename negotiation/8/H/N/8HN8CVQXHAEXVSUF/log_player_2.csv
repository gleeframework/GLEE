Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

You're looking to save as much money as possible, and $120 is still above your budget.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm still looking for a price that's closer to my minimum value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is closer to your budget, it's still above your ideal price.  You can likely get a better deal with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice. $100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking to my offer of $80.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $80, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you a price of $95. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is tempting, you're still looking to save more. You can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $95 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $85, which is a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $85. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you a price of $90. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice is clearly not going to go lower than $90. You've tried your best to negotiate a better price but it's getting close to your deadline. You've decided to go with the guaranteed price of $80 from John."
