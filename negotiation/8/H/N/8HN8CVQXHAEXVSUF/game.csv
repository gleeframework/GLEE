,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm still looking for a price that's closer to my minimum value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $100. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice. $100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking to my offer of $80.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $80, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you a price of $95. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $95 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $85, which is a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal. Let's close this deal.",85.0,Bob,6,
