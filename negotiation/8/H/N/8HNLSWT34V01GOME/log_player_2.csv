"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,150,000. This is still a good deal for you, given the value you've placed on it, and it aligns with my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle on this.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is exactly the same as the price John is offering.  Since Bob's goal is to save money, accepting Alice's offer doesn't save any more money than buying from John, but it avoids the possibility of a further negotiation that could potentially lead to a higher price."
