"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $140 is still a little too high for me.  I'm really set on $120. If you can meet me there, I'll take the product off your hands.  If not, I'll have to go with John's offer.",120.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $135 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm really sticking to $120.  If you can't go that low, I'll have to go with John's offer.",120.0,Bob,6,
