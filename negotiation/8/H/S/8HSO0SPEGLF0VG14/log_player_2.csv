# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?

{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $15,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000. What do you think?"",

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer the product to you for $12,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to budge, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $12,200. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:

It's unlikely Alice will go below $12,000.  It's better to secure the product from John at this point and avoid the risk of the price increasing or losing the deal altogether."
