"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $15,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer the product to you for $12,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $12,500 is still a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. How about we settle at $11,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $12,250. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",12250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for your patience. I'm willing to budge a little. How about $11,500? That's a significant move on my part, and I'm hoping we can close the deal on that.",11500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to budge, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $12,200. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",12200.0,Alice,7,
