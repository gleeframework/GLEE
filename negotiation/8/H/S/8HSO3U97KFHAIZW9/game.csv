"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $9,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid it's worth more than that to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,750. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,750 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is still a bit below my target price. However, I'm willing to compromise further. I'll offer it to you for $10,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you.",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to my budget, but $10,250 is still a bit of a stretch. How about $9,750? That's a fair offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal.",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,750 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'd like to make one more counteroffer to try to meet in the middle. I'll offer it to you for $10,100. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10100.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. Your final offer is tempting. How about we split the difference and settle at $9,925? That's a fair compromise for both of us.",9925.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. However, I'm not willing to go above $10,000. I'll offer it to you for $9,975. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",9975.0,Alice,9,
