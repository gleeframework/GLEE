"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $13,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly trying to get a price significantly higher than the product's worth to her ($8,000). 
* While $13,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's a good chance you can get a better price. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate her down or see if John (your backup option) might budge a little on his $15,000 price."
