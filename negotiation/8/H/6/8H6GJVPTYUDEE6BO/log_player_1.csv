Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $13,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Starting high aims to maximize potential profit. Since the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, there's room to negotiate down from a higher starting point. 
* **Leave Negotiation Space:** Offering a price of $13,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle while still securing a good profit for you. 
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, you still have John as a guaranteed buyer at $8,000, ensuring you don't lose out completely."
