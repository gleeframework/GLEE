"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You are aiming to save as much money as possible. 
* While $10,000 is a better deal than $12,000, you have room for negotiation and can potentially get a better price. 
* By rejecting the offer, you can counter with a lower price and see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're offering, but $10,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. That's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.  Let's work together to make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has come down to $9,500, which is closer to your desired price of $9,000.
* While you could continue negotiating, there is a risk that Alice will become less flexible or you might run out of rounds before reaching a deal.
* Accepting the offer guarantees you the product at a good price, and saves you time and potential frustration with further negotiation."
