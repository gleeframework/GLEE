"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above my budget ($15,000 vs. my $10,000 limit). It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $15,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $10,000 right now.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your honest feedback, Bob. I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still above my limit. I'm not willing to pay more than $10,000 for this product.  I'll continue negotiating to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still too high for me.  I'm very interested in the product, but my maximum budget is $10,000.  I'm hoping we can find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $13,500 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,500. This is as low as I can go, but I'm really hoping we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,500 is still above my budget of $10,000. While we're getting closer, I've already made two counteroffers, and Alice has rejected them both. I'm not confident that I'll be able to convince her to go any lower. It's better to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $10,000."
