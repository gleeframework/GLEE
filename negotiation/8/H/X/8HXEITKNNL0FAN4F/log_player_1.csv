Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $10,000. This is a good starting point as it's a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but it might still be attractive to Bob if he values the product highly.  I'll be prepared to negotiate if Bob rejects the offer, but I want to see what his initial reaction is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm not going to accept that right away. Bob is clearly trying to lowball me, so I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,000. This is still a good profit for me, and I'm hoping it's enough to incentivize Bob to come up a bit from his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is clearly trying to get the product for a very low price. I've already lowered my price once, and I'm not willing to go lower.  It's time to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $8,000.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still a decent profit and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a low price from Bob."
