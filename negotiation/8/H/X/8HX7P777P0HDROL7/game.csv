"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $13,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $13,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be happy to buy it for $11,500, which is still a good price for both of us. What do you think?",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,500. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $12,750. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",12750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,750 is still a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $12,250. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and it allows both of us to get a good deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",12250.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,250. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm offering $12,800. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a good deal for the product.",12800.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $12,800 is a good price, it's still a little outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,500.
