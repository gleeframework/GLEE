,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $22,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $18,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest, but $18,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $20,000? This price reflects the true value of the product.",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $20,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $18,000 and $20,000. How about we try $19,000? I think this is a fair price considering the product's value.",19000.0,Bob,4,
