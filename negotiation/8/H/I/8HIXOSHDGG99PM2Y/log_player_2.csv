"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great.** You can potentially get a better deal.
* **You're in a strong position.** You have a backup option with John for $12,000, so you don't have to settle immediately. 

**Next Steps:**

You should make a counteroffer to Alice, aiming for a price closer to your $12,000 limit, but still significantly lower than $12,000. This will allow for room to negotiate."

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  $9,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to come down a bit?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but I'm not comfortable going all the way down to $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better, but still not ideal.**  You're closer to your target price, but there's still room for negotiation.
* **You're still in a strong position.**  You can afford to be a little more demanding since you have the John option. 

**Next Steps:**

You should counteroffer again, aiming for a price slightly lower than $9,500. This demonstrates your willingness to negotiate but also reinforces that you're not desperate to close the deal immediately."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your target.**  You've gotten the price down significantly from the initial $9,000.
* **There's a risk of further negotiation.**  You could try to haggle a bit more, but it's possible Alice will become less willing to compromise, or you could end up stuck with John's higher price.
* **Time is a factor.**  Continuing to negotiate could drag things out and potentially cost you time and effort.

**Conclusion:**  It's a good deal, and you're close to your limit.  Accepting the offer is the most sensible choice."
