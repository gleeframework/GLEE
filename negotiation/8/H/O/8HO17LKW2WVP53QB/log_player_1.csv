Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I believe it's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $11,500 is more than Bob is willing to pay, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:** This gives you some wiggle room to negotiate without dropping below your minimum acceptable price.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:**  The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.

By starting at $11,500, you establish a clear baseline for negotiations, while leaving yourself open to potentially earning a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10500. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While it's tempting to accept, as it's still more than what the product is worth to Bob, I'm in a better position to negotiate further. 

By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my desired value.  I can also leverage the fact that I have a backup buyer in John, willing to pay $12,000, giving me more negotiating power."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  Instead of immediately rejecting Bob's offer, I'm proposing a middle ground price of $11,000. This shows willingness to negotiate while maintaining my stance that $10,500 is too low.
* **Highlight the value:**  I emphasize the ""value of the product"" to remind Bob of its worth and justify my price.
* **Positive tone:**  The message remains friendly and encourages further negotiation.

By offering $11,000, I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility, while also aiming for a price that's closer to my desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider $10750? I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,750 is closer to my desired price than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm not willing to settle for a price that significantly undervalues the product, especially considering that I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my full asking price.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation and attempt to push the price closer to my desired value.  I can also use the threat of selling to John as leverage in the negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming closer to my price. However, $10,750 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Would you be willing to consider $11,250? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway again:** I continue the pattern of compromise by offering a price that's the midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's current offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Reaffirming value:** I reiterate the value of the product to justify my price and keep it top of mind for Bob.
* **Positive framing:** The message emphasizes the benefits of a deal for both parties, focusing on a mutually satisfying outcome.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground that is more favorable to me while still showing a willingness to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $11000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, his offer of $11,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  Furthermore, the negotiations have gone back and forth for several rounds, and it's becoming clear that we are unlikely to reach a mutually agreeable price.

Given that I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my full asking price of $12,000, it's in my best interest to stop negotiating with Bob and sell the product to John. This ensures I get the maximum value for my product and avoids further time and effort spent on a potentially fruitless negotiation."
