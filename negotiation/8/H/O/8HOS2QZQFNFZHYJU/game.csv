"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  Could you meet me halfway at $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
