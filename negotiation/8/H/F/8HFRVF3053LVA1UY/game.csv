"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000. Would that work for you?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $9,000. It's a bit higher than your original offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate the counter offer, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could you meet me somewhere around $7,000?  I'm serious about buying if we can find a price that works for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit above your budget. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $8,200. It's a compromise, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8200.0,Alice,5,
