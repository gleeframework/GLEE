# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to you is $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a price you'll be happy with.
