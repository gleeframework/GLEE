"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you recognizing the value of the product to me.  However, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, as this would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to you is $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a price you'll be happy with.",9500.0,Alice,3,
