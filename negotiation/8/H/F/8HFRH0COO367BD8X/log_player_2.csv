"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this product for a price of $1,200,000. It's a significant value for you, and I believe it will be a strong asset for your business.  While I'm confident it's a fair price,  I am open to discussing a slightly adjusted figure if it helps us reach an agreement. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is below your maximum budget, her message indicates she's willing to negotiate. By rejecting this initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a better price, increasing the chance of securing a lower price closer to Alice's $800,000 valuation."
