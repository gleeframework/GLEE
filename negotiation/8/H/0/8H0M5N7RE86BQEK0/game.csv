"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's close this deal.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're making compromises, but $14,000 is still above my budget.  I can do $12,000.  That's a significant jump from my last offer, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen!",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand you're at your limit, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  How about $13,000? That's a small increase from my last offer and would be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's find a way to make this work.",13000.0,Alice,7,
