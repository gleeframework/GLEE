Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be comfortable with the price.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $7,500 is quite a bit below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,750?  This feels like a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8750}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but $8,750 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $7,750?

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the add-on, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $7,875? I'm willing to consider the add-on, but I need to feel like I'm getting a good deal on the product itself. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,875

Bob is very unlikely to move significantly from his current offer. It's time to cut our losses and take the guaranteed $8,000 from John."
