Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe this price would be more in line with my budget and would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While $1,200,000 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can secure a higher price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."

Bob's offer:

While I'd prefer a higher price, $1,250,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly better than selling to John for $1,000,000, and there's a chance Bob might not make a higher counteroffer. It's time to secure the deal."
