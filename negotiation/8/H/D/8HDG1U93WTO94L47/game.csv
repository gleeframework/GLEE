"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe this price would be more in line with my budget and would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $1200000 doesn't quite reflect the product's true value. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go lower than $1300000. This price still allows you a significant profit margin and demonstrates my willingness to negotiate. Let's aim for a deal that benefits both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1250000. I believe this price is a fair compromise and would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
