"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaving room for negotiation. This will allow me to gauge his interest and potentially start a bidding war. 

This is a high opening offer, as I'm confident in the value of my product and want to maximize my potential profit.  I also want to see if Bob is serious about buying."
