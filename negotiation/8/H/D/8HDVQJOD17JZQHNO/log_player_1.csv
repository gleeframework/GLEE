{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $14,500. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's close to my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the value to Bob to make the offer more appealing.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** The price is not my absolute bottom line, allowing for potential counteroffers. 

**Important Note:**  This is a starting point. The best price will depend on Bob's response and your assessment of his willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,500. I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $13,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Opportunity to improve:** I can potentially push for a higher price by making a counteroffer.
* **Risk assessment:** While selling to John for $15,000 is guaranteed, there's still a chance I can get closer to my ideal price by negotiating with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum. I'll need to consider Bob's stated limitations and my own risk tolerance."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $13,500 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $14,000, which is still a fantastic price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer is $500 higher than Bob's offer,  a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Reiterating value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him to reinforce the good deal he's getting.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I've left some room for further negotiation, as my minimum is $15,000, and I'm willing to go down to $14,000.

**Note:** The success of this counteroffer will depend on Bob's response and how much he values the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from $14,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13,800 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $13,800 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for improvement:** Even though Bob has come up slightly, I believe I can still negotiate a better price.
* **Assessing risk:** While selling to John for $15,000 is guaranteed, I'm not quite ready to give up on getting a higher price from Bob.  He's shown a willingness to negotiate, and I want to see if I can push a little further.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a final counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum.  I'll need to consider his offer and my own risk tolerance. I'll also need to factor in the possibility that Bob might reject my offer and I'll need to decide whether to sell to John or continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still not quite there with $13,800.  Let's split the difference.  How about $14,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can do.  If you're not comfortable with that, I'm going to have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** This is my final counteroffer, as it's close to my minimum, and I'm not willing to go any lower.
* **Creating urgency:** I'm subtly creating a sense of urgency by mentioning the possibility of moving on to another buyer.
* **Splitting the difference:** This counteroffer represents a compromise, splitting the difference between my last offer and Bob's latest offer. 
* **Clear terms:** The message is clear and concise, leaving no room for misinterpretation.

**Note:** The success of this counteroffer depends on Bob's willingness to close the deal. If he rejects it, I'll have to make a decision about whether to sell to John or to continue negotiating."
