"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,500. I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",13500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $13,500 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $14,000, which is still a fantastic price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit far from $14,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13,800 for the product?",13800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still not quite there with $13,800.  Let's split the difference.  How about $14,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can do.  If you're not comfortable with that, I'm going to have to move on to another buyer.",14000.0,Alice,5,
