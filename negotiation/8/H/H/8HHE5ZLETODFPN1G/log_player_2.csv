"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $100 is less than its value to her, it's still more than you're willing to pay. You know you can get the product for $80 from John.  You're better off rejecting Alice's offer and going with John."
