,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1200000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $1300000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $1350000? ",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $1350000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better. How about $1275000?",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1275000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1312500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product and our previous discussions. ",1312500.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we're getting closer! While $1297500 is still a bit below my desired price point, I'm willing to compromise. Let's settle on $1305000. This represents a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to walk away satisfied. ",1305000.0,Alice,7,
