"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $900,000 is far too low. Let's find some common ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This still gives you a good value, and it's closer to what the product is worth to me. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,012,500? It's a fair compromise and still provides you with a significant value.  What do you think?",1012500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we are getting closer.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $990,000.  That's a significant jump from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product.",990000.0,Bob,6,
