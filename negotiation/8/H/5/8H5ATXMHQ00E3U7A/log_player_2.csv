"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a good price, it's still worth trying to negotiate further. Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and there's a chance he can get a better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $13,500, which is a significant decrease from her initial offer of $14,000.  This is a good price for Bob, considering he's willing to pay $15,000 from John.  There's a risk that Alice might reject another counteroffer, pushing the price closer to John's offer.  It's better to secure the product at a reasonable price now."
