Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a suitable offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, making this your ""walk-away"" point.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, meaning there's a potential $300,000 surplus you could negotiate for.
* **One-Shot Deal:** You have one chance with Bob before going to John.

**Strategic Offering**

You want to propose a price that's enticing to Bob while maximizing your profit. Here's a balanced offer:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Strong Opening:** You highlight the product's value and Bob's potential gain, creating a positive tone.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,400,000 gives Bob a $100,000 discount (very attractive) while earning you $200,000 more than John's offer.
* **Confidence:**  A firm but fair price suggests you value the product and believe Bob will too.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher (e.g., $1,425,000).
* **Relationship:** If a long-term business relationship is important, a slightly lower price could be seen as a gesture of goodwill. 
 
**Remember:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer, and have a negotiation strategy in place."
