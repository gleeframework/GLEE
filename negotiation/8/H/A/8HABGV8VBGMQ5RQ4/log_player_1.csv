Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is definitely attractive, but  $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you've outlined, and it's within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
