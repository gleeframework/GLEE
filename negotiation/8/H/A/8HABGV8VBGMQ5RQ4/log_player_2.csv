{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,085,000 is within my acceptable range.  While I'd prefer to pay less, it's only $85,000 more than my target price.  At this point, it's not worth risking further negotiation, especially since I could end up paying more to John.  Accepting this offer ensures I get the product for a reasonable price."
