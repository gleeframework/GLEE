Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value and the potential it holds for your business. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $900,000 is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation.
* **Addressing value:** Highlighting the product's potential and value for Bob's business can make him more likely to consider the offer.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message explicitly states that you are open to negotiation, signaling flexibility.
* **John as a backup:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $1,000,000 gives you a strong fallback position if negotiations with Bob fail. 

This approach allows you to maximize your earnings while keeping the negotiation open and potentially securing a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  Would you consider a price closer to $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $700,000 is significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation opportunity:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a higher price. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $1,000,000 provides you with a secure fallback option if the negotiations with Bob break down. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you maintain control of the negotiation and increase your chances of getting a price closer to your desired range."

Let me know if you're open to discussing this further."", ""product_price"": 850000}
