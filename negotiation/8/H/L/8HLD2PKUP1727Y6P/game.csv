"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you have a budget in mind, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1300000, but I'm not flexible beyond that. This is a unique product, and I think it's worth every penny.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product is unique, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $1150000. I hope we can come to an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1150000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you at $1250000, which is a 10% discount from my initial offer. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your concession, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1200000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to consider other options, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
