"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down a bit from your original price. However, I'm still looking to spend closer to $8,000. I'm willing to offer you $8,500.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $9,250? Let me know what you think.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,250 is still a bit out of my budget. Let's try $9,000. I'm really interested in your product, but I need to stay within my price range.",9000.0,Bob,4,
