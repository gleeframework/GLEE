"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to own this valuable product. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point considering its potential value to you."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong opening:** Starting high shows confidence and leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Anchoring:** The initial high price anchors the negotiation in a higher range. Even if Bob rejects this offer, his counteroffer is more likely to be higher than if we started lower.
* **Justification:** While vague, mentioning ""potential value"" hints at the product's worth without revealing our bottom line.

We are aiming high initially, but the $1,500,000 offer from John provides a safety net. We have nine more rounds to negotiate if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but my budget for this product is capped at $1,500,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is our absolute minimum acceptable price. However, it's too early to settle. We have plenty of rounds left, and there's a good chance we can negotiate a better deal.  Let's see if we can push Bob a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,500,000 is significantly below its true market value.  To find a middle ground, how about we settle at $2,000,000?"", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** We are coming down from our initial offer, signaling that we are willing to negotiate.
* **Justification:** We are reiterating the product's high value without being overly aggressive.
* **Target:** Our new offer is still significantly above Bob's budget and our minimum, leaving room for further negotiation. 

We are aiming to slowly draw Bob closer to a price point that works for us while remaining firm on the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I still can't exceed my budget. Let's try $1,800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly willing to negotiate, and his offer is getting closer to a price we might accept. However, we still have room to maneuver. With six rounds remaining, it's worth pushing a bit further to see if we can secure a deal closer to $1,900,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,800,000 is close, but to make this work on my end, I'd need to see a price of $1,950,000.  This reflects the true value of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** We are making a smaller concession this round, indicating that we are reaching a point where we are less willing to move significantly.
* **Firm but Fair:**  The message maintains a polite and collaborative tone while emphasizing that our counteroffer is a firm reflection of the product's value.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Our offer is now slightly above the midpoint between our previous offer and Bob's last offer. This signals our willingness to meet in the middle but also maintains upward pressure on the price.

We are getting closer to a potential deal but are prepared to walk away if Bob isn't willing to meet our price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a final offer of $1,750,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Bob's offer of $1,750,000 is a reasonable compromise at this stage. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:**  We are still securing a $250,000 profit above our minimum acceptable price. 
* **""Final Offer"" Signal:** Bob using the phrase ""final offer"" suggests he's unlikely to move much higher. 
* **Time Value:**  Dragging out the negotiation for a potentially small increase in price isn't worth the risk of losing Bob altogether.  

Accepting this offer guarantees a good profit now, rather than risking a lower outcome by continuing the negotiation."
