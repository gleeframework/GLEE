"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and leave room for negotiation.  $18,000 is a significant markup from my minimum price of $12,000, but it allows for potential concessions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to accept such a significant loss. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm dropping my price to $14,000, which is still above my minimum, but closer to Bob's offer.  This shows willingness to negotiate while still protecting my value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to accept it at this stage. I'm hopeful that I can secure a better price with further negotiation. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm making a final concession with this offer.  $12,500 is only slightly above my minimum, demonstrating that I'm serious about closing a deal.  I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is a bit below my minimum, I'm getting close to my reserve price and it's more than Bob's previous offer. It's getting late in the game, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale and avoids the potential of a lower offer in the next round."
