"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. I think this is a great price considering its value to you is $800,000. It's a win-win for both of us! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below her own valuation, it's significantly higher than your maximum price and what John offers. Rejecting this offer opens the door for a counter-offer from Alice that might be closer to your acceptable range or allows you to purchase from John at a much lower price."
