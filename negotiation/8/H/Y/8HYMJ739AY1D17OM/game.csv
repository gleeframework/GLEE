"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $900,000 is tempting, I'm looking for a price closer to $1,050,000.  This is still a significant discount from my usual asking price, and it leaves room for both of us to be happy.  What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit far apart on the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
