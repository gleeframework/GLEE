Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Higher than Bob's perceived value:**  Giving him room to negotiate while still leaving a good profit margin for you.
* **Significantly lower than your minimum:**  This allows for room to negotiate down if necessary without dipping below your minimum threshold. 

It also includes a friendly message to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a lot of money, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I need to push for a higher offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $900,000 is tempting, I'm looking for a price closer to $1,050,000.  This is still a significant discount from my usual asking price, and it leaves room for both of us to be happy.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit far apart on the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, and it's likely that further negotiation would only result in a slight increase. Accepting his offer ensures a good profit and avoids further negotiation, which could potentially lead to a lower price or a breakdown in the negotiations."
