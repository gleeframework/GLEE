Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value and potential for you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is strategically chosen:

* **It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives him some room to negotiate and makes him feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's significantly lower than my minimum:** This leaves me with room to negotiate down if necessary and ensures I get a good price. 

By starting with a higher offer, I am setting a strong initial negotiating position and creating an incentive for Bob to make a counteroffer. This allows me to gauge his interest and potentially secure a deal closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering I'm paying a significant premium compared to John's offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a considerable improvement over Bob's initial perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $1,500,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my target. 

By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, I signal that I'm not willing to settle for a price that undervalues the product. This also keeps the negotiation active and gives me more control over the process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still below my desired price.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,050,000?  This price reflects the product's value and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This represents a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us to both walk away satisfied. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has increased his offer to $950,000, it's still significantly below my minimum desired price of $1,500,000.  The negotiation has reached a point where further counteroffers are unlikely to yield a satisfactory result for me. 

Selling to John for $1,500,000 ensures that I meet my minimum price requirement and maximize my profit. It's a safe and reliable option, eliminating the risk of further negotiation with Bob potentially leading to a lower price."
