"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to capture a large portion of the potential surplus.  I'm confident Bob will see value in buying the product for less than its worth to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly less than my desired profit.  I believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.  I'm aiming for a compromise that still allows me to make a good profit, while making it more attractive to Bob than his last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm again lowering my price, but only slightly.  I'm showing a willingness to compromise, but also making it clear that I'm not willing to go too much lower.  I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's getting close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  I'm confident that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
```

I'm making a final counteroffer, lowering my price just a bit more.  I'm showing a willingness to meet Bob halfway, while still ensuring I make a profit. I'm hoping this is the offer that will convince Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's only slightly above my minimum, it's still a profitable sale.  With only a few rounds left, the risk of continuing to negotiate and not finding a deal is too high. It's better to secure a sale now than to risk losing out entirely."
