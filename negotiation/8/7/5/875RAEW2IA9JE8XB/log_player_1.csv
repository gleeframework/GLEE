Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Reasonable Offer:**  The price is significantly lower than Bob's perceived value, making it enticing for him to consider.
* **Positive Tone:**  My message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

This strategy allows me to maximize my potential profit while still leaving room for a win-win scenario with Bob. If he rejects, I'll continue negotiating, keeping John's offer as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm hoping to pay a bit less considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. Let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's above John's offer, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate a higher price with Bob, as his offer shows he's willing to pay more than my minimum. 
* **Strategic Counter-Offer:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can present a counter-offer that aims to bridge the gap between our positions.

This decision allows me to continue negotiating with Bob and potentially achieve a better price than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is lower than I initially hoped, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm prepared to accept $1,100,000 for the product. This price reflects its value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** This counteroffer is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's latest offer.  It shows my willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Positive Tone:** The message remains friendly and emphasizes a fair deal for both parties, making it less likely to shut down the negotiation.
* **Balanced Approach:** The offer maintains a balance between my desire to maximize profit and the need to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation. 

I believe this counteroffer has a strong chance of being accepted by Bob. If he rejects it, I'll re-evaluate my strategy, considering his willingness to negotiate further and John's offer as a backup."
