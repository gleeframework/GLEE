"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible.  While $1,150,000 is a better price than John's offer, it's still higher than the product's value to Alice ($1,000,000). There's room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm hoping to pay a bit less considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. Let me know if this is acceptable."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than her valuation of the product. This shows a willingness to negotiate while also aiming for a significant discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is lower than I initially hoped, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm prepared to accept $1,100,000 for the product. This price reflects its value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,100,000, which is still above her valuation but below your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might reject your counteroffer and you'd be forced to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting this offer secures the product at a price that's a good compromise."
