"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $95 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $100. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100.

At this point, Alice's offer matches John's price. There's no benefit to further negotiation or going with John.  It's best to accept and avoid potentially losing the deal."
