"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a high-quality item that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm looking for $120 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, and you're willing to pay $120 for the product from John, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer. You might be able to get a better price by negotiating with Alice or finding another seller."
