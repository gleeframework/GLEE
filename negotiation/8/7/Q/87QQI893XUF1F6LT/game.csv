"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $750,000 doesn't reflect the true worth of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly, but I need to ensure I receive a fair price. I'm proposing a price of $850,000. This offers a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a price that still benefits both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $775,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",775000.0,Bob,4,
