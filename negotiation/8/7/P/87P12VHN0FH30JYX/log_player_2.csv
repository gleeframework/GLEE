"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

There's no point in accepting the offer at face value. We want to see if we can get a lower price from Alice. There's also no need to buy from John immediately since his price is our maximum.  We'll try to negotiate with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a lower price allows us to establish a negotiation point. This counteroffer represents a significant discount, leaving room for compromise and potential agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is already coming down in price. We can still try to get a better price. There's no reason to accept her offer yet, as we still have room for a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 725000}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer to a deal. By offering a price slightly higher than our previous offer, we show willingness to compromise while still seeking a better deal. This counteroffer allows for some wiggle room in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $740,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $740,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now very close to our last counteroffer, and we're within our budget. Accepting this offer means saving $60,000 compared to buying from John.  The risk of further negotiation is not worth the potential savings of a few more thousand dollars.  We're likely to get a better price than our initial counteroffer, so it's time to close the deal."
