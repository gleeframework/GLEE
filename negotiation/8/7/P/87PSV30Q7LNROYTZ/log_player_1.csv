"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I'm selling, and I think you'd be very interested.  I'm starting the price at $120.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($80). This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Positive Message:** The message is friendly and optimistic, aiming to build rapport with Bob.
* **Value Proposition:** I briefly mention the product's value to pique Bob's interest without revealing too much information. 
* **First Offer:** This offer is meant to gauge Bob's initial interest and potential budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Space:**  While $90 is closer to my minimum price, there's still room for negotiation.  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Value Signaling:** Rejecting Bob's offer signals that I believe the product is worth more than $90.
* **Avoiding John:** Selling to John at this point would be less profitable than continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $105. I believe this reflects the true value of the product. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Rationale:** I'm not drastically lowering my price, but offering a compromise that shows flexibility while still being profitable.
* **Value Justification:** I reiterate the product's value, reinforcing my belief that $105 is a fair price.
* **Open-Ended Question:**  The question ""Would you be willing to meet me halfway?"" encourages Bob to think about a potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $105 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Desired Price:** $95 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80. This is a good deal given the potential for further negotiation.
* **Time Constraints:** We're already in round 4, so time is becoming a factor.
* **Risk of John:** If I keep rejecting Bob's offers, I risk him getting frustrated and walking away. Selling to John at this point wouldn't be as profitable. 

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale that is close to my ideal price, and I avoid the potential for a longer, more uncertain negotiation."
