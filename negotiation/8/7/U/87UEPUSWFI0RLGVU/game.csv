"Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you reaching out. While I think the product is great,  $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'd be happy to pay $85 for it.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $105. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $105 is still a little out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $90, which I think is a fair price considering what I'm willing to spend. What do you say?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $105 was still a bit too high for you, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to $90. I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer it to you for $98. It's a small step back from my previous offer, but I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",98.0,Alice,5,
