,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm not sure it's worth $1,000,000 to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $900,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While I value your interest, $900,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but I'm firm on $950,000.  This is a fair price, considering the benefits you'll receive.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $920,000, but I need to be honest, I'm really interested in buying this product, and I'm not sure I can go any higher. Can you meet me in the middle?",920000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you loud and clear. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $935,000 for this product. It's a great opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. Let's seal this deal.",935000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to a deal, but $935,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, but I need to be honest, I'm really interested in buying this product, and I'm not sure I can go any higher. Can you consider this offer?",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I still need to recoup a significant portion of my investment. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $930,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from it. It's a win-win situation, and I believe it's worth closing this deal.",930000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm afraid $930,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000, but I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we won't be able to reach an agreement. Can you consider this offer?",920000.0,Bob,8,
