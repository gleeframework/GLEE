"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $600,000 for it.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is significantly lower than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need something closer to $900,000 to make this work for me.  Let's find a middle ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to get a fair price. How about we split the difference closer to your number?  Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $750,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This price reflects the product's value to you, while still allowing me to cover my costs.  What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,5,
