Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,800,000 is still above my limit.  I'm confident that $1,400,000 is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is increasing his offer, it's clear his ceiling is significantly lower than John's guaranteed offer. Accepting Bob's offer of $1,400,000 means losing out on a guaranteed $100,000.  Continuing the negotiation with Bob carries the risk of him not reaching $1,500,000 within the remaining rounds. It's strategically sound to secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
