"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $16000.  It's a great deal and you know the value it holds.  Let me know if you're interested, but I can always sell it to John for $15000 if you decline. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You know the product is worth $15,000 to you, and Alice is asking for $16,000. You can get the same product from John for $15,000. So it's better to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
