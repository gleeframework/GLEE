"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $12000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth significantly more to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  $12,000 is less than $15,000. 
* **You save money:** By accepting Alice's offer, you save $3,000 compared to buying from John. 
* **Even if you reject Alice's offer, you still have the option to buy from John:**  This gives you some leverage in negotiations, but it's still a good deal to accept Alice's offer."
