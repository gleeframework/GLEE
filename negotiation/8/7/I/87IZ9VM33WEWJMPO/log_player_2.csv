"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity that could significantly enhance your business operations. I believe its value to you is $1000000, but I'm willing to start our negotiation at $1200000. Let's discuss how we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay more. By rejecting, Bob can start a counteroffer process and potentially get a better price from Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. Considering your budget constraints, I am willing to adjust the price to $1100000. This still allows us to maintain a fair profit while making the product accessible to you. I look forward to your consideration of this offer.

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $1,000,000. 

Alice's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget.  Since he can get the product from John for a lower price, there's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice."
