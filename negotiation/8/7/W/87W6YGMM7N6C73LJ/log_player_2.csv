Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll counteroffer at $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

Alice is clearly trying to get as close to her desired price as possible. While I could try to negotiate further, the difference at this point is relatively small, and it's not worth the risk of losing the deal entirely.  Securing the product at $1,050,000 is a good deal compared to John's offer."
