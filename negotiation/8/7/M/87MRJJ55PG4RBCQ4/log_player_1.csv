Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($120) but below my minimum acceptable price ($150). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, hoping to build rapport and encourage him to consider it. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** By asking ""What do you think?"", I'm showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but my budget allows me to spend no more than $120 on this item. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below My Minimum:** While I'd like to sell the product, Bob's offer of $120 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Opportunity for Counter-Offer:** I'm choosing to reject his offer because I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I can counter-offer with a price closer to my minimum. 
* **Risk of Losing Bob:** There's a chance that rejecting his offer will lead to him walking away entirely, but I'm willing to take that risk for now.  I believe a counter-offer might sway him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm not able to go as low as $120, I'm willing to come down to $135. This still gives me a reasonable profit, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my initial offer ($140) and Bob's offer ($120). This demonstrates my willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, hoping to justify my counter-offer.
* **Open Communication:** I'm keeping the communication open and positive, asking for Bob's feedback to keep the negotiation moving."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to accommodate my budget. However, I would like to propose a price of $125 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise given the value of the item. I hope this suggestion is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Risk of Reaching Impasse:** There's a risk that if I reject his offer, he might walk away. However, I'm willing to take that risk because I believe I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Counter-Offer Potential:** I'm choosing to reject his offer because I think I can still get a better price by making another counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and the back-and-forth. I'm close to my minimum, but I can't quite go as low as $125.  Would you be willing to meet me at $130? This is a great deal for both of us, and it allows me to move forward with the sale. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:**  This offer is a final compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.
* **Emphasizing Mutual Benefit:** I emphasize that this price is ""a great deal for both of us"" to make the offer more appealing. 
* **Urgency and Closure:** I use phrases like ""close to my minimum"" and ""let me know what you think"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage a decision."
