{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be profitable for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Room for Compromise:** This offer allows for potential compromise. Bob may counteroffer, giving us a chance to meet somewhere in the middle.
* **Backup Plan:**  I'm aware that I can sell to John for $1,500,000, so I'm not desperate to close a deal with Bob at a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's counteroffer of $900,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  There's a good chance that Bob will be willing to pay more than $900,000, especially if he sees that I'm not desperate to sell.
* **Backup Plan:** Selling to John for $1,500,000 remains a viable option. 

By rejecting Bob's offer and counteroffering, I'm trying to negotiate a better price and avoid selling too cheaply."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While it's closer to my expectations, I'm still not able to accept it at this time.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, but that's my absolute bottom line. This product is truly valuable, and I believe it will be a great investment for you."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintain Leverage:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer, but I'm not completely closing the door. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not desperate.
* **Counteroffer:** I'm counteroffering with a price of $1,100,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, showing flexibility, but it's still well above Bob's perceived value and closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm highlighting the product's value and its potential for Bob's business.  This could help persuade Bob to increase his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable and moves us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** While Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, it's still significantly lower than my desired outcome.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation.  Bob has shown a willingness to increase his offer, and I can likely push him a bit further.
* **Selling to John:**  I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,500,000, so I'm not under pressure to accept Bob's offer just yet.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm maintaining my negotiating leverage and aiming for a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued effort to reach an agreement.  While your offer of $1,000,000 is getting closer, it's still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000.  This price reflects the product's true value and allows for a win-win scenario for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:**  I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price from my previous offer, showing Bob that I'm serious about making a deal.
* **Meet in the Middle:** This offer is a compromise,  midway between my previous counteroffer of $1,100,000 and Bob's last offer of $1,000,000. 
* **Maintain Pressure:**  While I'm willing to come down, I'm not giving in entirely. I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my desired outcome.  
* **Emphasize Win-Win:**  I'm framing the offer as a win-win for both of us, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and potentially encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your efforts in negotiating. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,025,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is within your acceptable range and helps us reach a fair agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the Limit:**  Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,050,000. However, it's still slightly below my target.
* **Risk of Going Lower:**  If I reject Bob's offer and counteroffer again, there's a risk that he might walk away, leaving me with no deal.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees a significant profit. This is a more secure and potentially more profitable option compared to risking further negotiation with Bob.

While I would like to get a slightly higher price, the potential for Bob to walk away and the certainty of a higher profit with John make selling to John the most logical decision at this point."
