Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for bargaining and gives the impression that the product might be even more valuable.
* **Justification:** By saying ""I think it would be perfect for you,"" Alice subtly implies the product is worth the higher price *specifically* to Bob.
* **Alternative:** Mentioning she'll list it publicly creates a sense of scarcity and a potential loss for Bob if he doesn't act.

**Important Note:** While John offers a safety net, Alice's primary goal is to maximize profit.  This opening offer aims to achieve that."
