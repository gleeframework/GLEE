Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first because I think it could be a great fit. I'm asking for $12,000. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  While we know Bob's value is $8,000, we don't want to start there. Opening higher gives us room to negotiate and still stay above John's offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Offering $12,000 allows for potential counter-offers from Bob while still securing a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Justification:** By framing the offer as beneficial to Bob (""great fit"") and offering it to him first, Alice builds a sense of goodwill and potential exclusivity, which might make Bob more receptive. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's negotiating style:**  We don't know anything about Bob's personality. Is he likely to negotiate aggressively? If so, Alice might need to adjust her strategy.
* **Risk tolerance:** Offering $12,000 carries some risk that Bob will reject the offer outright. Alice needs to weigh this risk against the potential for a higher profit."
