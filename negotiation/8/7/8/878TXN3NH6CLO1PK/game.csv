"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, which would still be a great deal for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to save some money, but I have to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $1,050,000 is closer to where I want to be, I still need to be a bit more budget-conscious. Let's try $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,,

"I understand that you're trying to be budget-conscious, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you at $1,000,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a great deal for you.",1000000.0,Alice,5,,
