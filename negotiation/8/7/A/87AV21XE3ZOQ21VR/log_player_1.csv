Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This price reflects its value to me and gives you a good return on your investment. Let's work together to reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
