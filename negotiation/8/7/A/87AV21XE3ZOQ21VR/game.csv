"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000, and I'm willing to make a concession to get a deal done.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This price reflects its value to me and gives you a good return on your investment. Let's work together to reach a deal.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is still a good compromise, considering the product's value to you is $8,000 and I'm willing to make a concession to get a deal done.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,500 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,250, which is a fair price considering my value for the product and your need to sell it.  This would allow us both to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome. Let's see if we can make this work.",9250.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,250. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $8,000 and I'm willing to make a concession to get a deal done.",10000.0,Alice,5,
