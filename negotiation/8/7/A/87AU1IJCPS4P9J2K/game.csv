"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, Alice.  How about $12,200? I'm trying to stay within a tight budget.",12200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. How about we get closer to my target price with $13,500? I'm willing to make a slight concession to meet you halfway between $12,200 and my original price of $14,000.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price.  I can go up to $12,500.  It's a fair offer, and it works for my budget.",12500.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500, but I think I can do a bit better than that. How about $13,000? It's a small increase, but it gets me closer to my target price.",13000.0,Alice,7,
