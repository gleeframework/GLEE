You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

It's not worth buying from Alice at $900,000 when you can get it from John for $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but still above what you're willing to pay from John. It leaves room for negotiation, but also shows that you're serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

While $850,000 is closer to your target, it's still above what John is offering. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice."
