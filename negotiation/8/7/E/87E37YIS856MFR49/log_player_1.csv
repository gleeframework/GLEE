{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to the product's value to Bob, but I'm leaving room for negotiation.  I'm also being friendly and encouraging in my message to build a good rapport.  If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I believe I can come to an even better agreement. How about we aim for $850,000 for the product? I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I believe I can do better, and I'm willing to negotiate further.  I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer.  I'm confident I can secure a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm hoping for a price closer to $950,000. It's a significant investment for you, and this price reflects the true value of the product. I'm open to further discussion, but let's aim for a price that's fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about we consider $900,000 for the product? This still offers a good return on your investment while being more within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate.  While it's still below what the product is worth to me, it's a good compromise, and I can still earn a significant profit."
