"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity that I think you'll find very appealing. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $1,100,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to land a bit lower. Would you be willing to consider $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're trying to drive a hard bargain. I appreciate your persistence, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet at $1,050,000? I think that's a reasonable compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, you're right, I am trying to get the best deal I can. I understand you need to feel good about the price too. How about we settle at $1,012,500?  That's right in the middle of our last two offers.",1012500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $1,050,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to stay above that threshold. How about we discuss a price of $1,025,000? It's a small increase from our previous midpoint, but I think it's a fair price for the product.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference again and settle at $1,018,750?",1018750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I think we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,018,750. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to stay above $1,025,000. How about we meet at $1,030,000? I think that's a fair price, and it's worth considering given the value the product will bring to you.",1030000.0,Alice,9,
