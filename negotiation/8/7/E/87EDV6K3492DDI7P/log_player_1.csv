Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're aiming for more than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob might counter, but you have room to negotiate down slightly without losing too much profit.
* **It's appealing to Bob:** The price is still below the value he places on the product, making it a good deal for him. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
