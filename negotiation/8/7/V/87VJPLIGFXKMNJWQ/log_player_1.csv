Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $120 is higher than the $80 Bob thinks the product is worth, giving him a reason to consider the offer.
* **It's below your minimum:** It's below your minimum of $150, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  A $120 price gives you a chance to potentially earn a good profit while still leaving space for negotiation.

This strategy aims to find a price point where Bob is willing to accept while maximizing your profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than your minimum of $150 and the $120 you initially offered.  You're better off rejecting this offer and trying to negotiate a higher price with Bob. There's still room to find a price that works for both of you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $90 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $100. This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise:

* **Higher than Bob's offer:** It's higher than Bob's offer of $90, showing you're willing to negotiate.
* **Lower than your initial offer:**  It's lower than your initial offer of $120, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Closer to your minimum:**  It's still above your minimum of $150, allowing for potential profit.

This approach tries to find a middle ground, encouraging Bob to consider your counteroffer while keeping your profit in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $100, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $85 is too far below my minimum of $150.  While I'm open to negotiating, I can't afford to sell the product for such a low price.  Selling to John for $150 guarantees me my minimum and avoids further negotiations that might not be fruitful."
