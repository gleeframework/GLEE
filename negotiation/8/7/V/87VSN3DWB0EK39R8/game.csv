"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. It's a steal at this price, and I'm sure you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm interested but $950000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'd be willing to pay $750000 for the product.  This price would make it a good value for me, and I'd be able to move forward with the purchase.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $950000 is a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll be very happy with the product at this price.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $850000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $800000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be able to close the deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $800000, but I'm still not willing to give up too much profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850000 and $800000. I'll sell the product to you for $825000. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the product at this price.",825000.0,Alice,5,
