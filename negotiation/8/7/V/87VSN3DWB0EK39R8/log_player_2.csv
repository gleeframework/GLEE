"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. It's a steal at this price, and I'm sure you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better deal."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm interested but $950,000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'd be willing to pay $750,000 for the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $950000 is a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll be very happy with the product at this price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, there's still room for improvement.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and hopefully get an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $800,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be able to close the deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $800000, but I'm still not willing to give up too much profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850000 and $800000. I'll sell the product to you for $825000. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price.  While there's still room for a little more negotiation, the risk of Alice walking away or Bob having to buy from John for a much higher price outweighs the potential benefit of continuing to bargain.  $825,000 is a good compromise and a solid price for Bob."
