Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $175, but I'm open to reasonable offers."", 
""product_price"": 175
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price slightly. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The message implies there's room for negotiation (""open to reasonable offers""). This encourages Bob to counter-offer if he's interested.
* **Not going too high:** While we want to maximize profit, setting the price too high (e.g., $250) will likely lead to Bob immediately rejecting the offer without a counter-proposal.

This strategy aims to find a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while ensuring you don't lose him as a buyer, knowing you have John as a backup."
