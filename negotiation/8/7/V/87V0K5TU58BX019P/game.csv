"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you starting with a competitive price, but $150 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested in the product, and I'd be happy to pay $110 for it. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $140. Would you be willing to consider that price?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not quite there on $140. How about we split the difference and go with $125?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both be happy with.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $135. It's still a bit higher than $125, but I believe it's a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,5,
