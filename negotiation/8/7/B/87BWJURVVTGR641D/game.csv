"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider a price of $1,450,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in the product, $1,450,000 is still a stretch for me.  Would you be open to $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts in finding a compromise.  How about we meet halfway at $1,200,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
