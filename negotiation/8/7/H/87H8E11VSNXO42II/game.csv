"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $15000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",15000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $15000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $18000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",18000.0,Alice,3,
