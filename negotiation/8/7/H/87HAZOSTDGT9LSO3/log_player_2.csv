"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $150 by myself. Considering its quality and the benefits it provides, I believe it's worth more than $120 to you. Would you like to make an offer closer to my asking price or discuss the value you see in the product? I'm open to negotiation but would appreciate if we could find a fair agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145.
