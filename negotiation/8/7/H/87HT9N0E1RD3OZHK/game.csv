"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure it's a good value for my budget. Can you meet me at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about we split the difference?  $10,500 seems fair to me, considering the value of this product. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we try $10,250? That's the highest I'm comfortable going. Can you meet me there?",10250.0,Bob,4,
