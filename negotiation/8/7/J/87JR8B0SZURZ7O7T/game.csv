"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  This product would be a good asset for me, but I need a price that makes sense. How about $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the value I'm bringing to the table.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,400,000 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you consider $1,100,000? That's a fair offer.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
