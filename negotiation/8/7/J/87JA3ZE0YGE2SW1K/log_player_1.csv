Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $990,000 is still not enough for me to let go of this product.  How about $1,000,000?  That's a fair price for both of us.  It's the maximum I can go at this point,  but I'm confident it's a win-win situation.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
