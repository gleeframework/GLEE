,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your offer. However, $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $100? Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",100.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $100 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $95.  This is my best offer, let's make a deal!",95.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $97? That's just a few dollars more than your offer, and it gets us closer to a deal.  What do you say?",97.0,Alice,5,
