"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'll love it. My price is $110. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about $90?  Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than my minimum price of $120. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'll need to counteroffer to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your offer. However, $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $100? Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $100 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $95.  This is my best offer, let's make a deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is closer to my minimum price of $120, it's still not quite there. I believe I can push for a bit more, especially since Bob has already indicated he is interested in the product and willing to negotiate.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $97? That's just a few dollars more than your offer, and it gets us closer to a deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 97}
