Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting with an ambitious offer of $1,500,000. This leaves room for negotiation, but still reflects the value I place on the product. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play ball at a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm happy with $1,200,000, I believe I can do better. Bob's initial offer reflects his willingness to pay at least that amount, so there's room for negotiation. I'll counter with a slightly lower price, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,350,000. This is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to negotiate. It's also a significant increase over Bob's initial offer, so it shows I'm not desperate to sell at his price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has come up slightly, and at $1,250,000, we're close enough to my minimum price.  Accepting his offer is the best strategy, as it guarantees a sale and secures a price that is only slightly below my ideal."
