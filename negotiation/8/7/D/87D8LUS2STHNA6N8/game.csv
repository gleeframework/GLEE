,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $1,250,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,050,000 just isn't enough for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This still gives you a great value for the product, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you say?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $1,100,000. This price would be a good deal for both of us, and allow us to finalize this transaction.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,100,000 is still a bit lower than I can accept. I'm willing to go down to $1,125,000 -  this is a fair compromise that considers both our positions. Let's get this deal done, what do you say?",1125000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1,125,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,110,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe we can close this deal.",1110000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close, but $1,110,000 just isn't quite there yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,117,500. This is a very fair compromise and a great opportunity for both of us. Let's close this deal, what do you say?",1117500.0,Alice,7,
