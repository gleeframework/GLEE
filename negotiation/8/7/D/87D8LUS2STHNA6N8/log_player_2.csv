"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. This is a great deal, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $1,250,000 is still too high, and he has room to negotiate for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $1,250,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,050,000 just isn't enough for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This still gives you a great value for the product, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice has come down in price, $1,150,000 is still more than Bob wants to pay. He should reject the offer and see if he can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $1,100,000. This price would be a good deal for both of us, and allow us to finalize this transaction."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,100,000 is still a bit lower than I can accept. I'm willing to go down to $1,125,000 -  this is a fair compromise that considers both our positions. Let's get this deal done, what do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. While Alice has moved closer to his desired price, he can still potentially get a better deal. There are a few rounds left, so he should try to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1,125,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,110,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1110000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close, but $1,110,000 just isn't quite there yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,117,500. This is a very fair compromise and a great opportunity for both of us. Let's close this deal, what do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,117,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,117,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John. He's already gone through several rounds of negotiation with Alice and hasn't been able to get the price down to a point where it's worth it for him.  While Alice's offer is getting closer, it's still more than what John is offering.  With only a few rounds left, Bob shouldn't risk not getting the product at a decent price."
