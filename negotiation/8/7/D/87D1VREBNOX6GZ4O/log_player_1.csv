Round 2
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable offer, it's unlikely he'll reach the $1,000,000 mark.  At this stage, the difference between Bob's best offer and John's guaranteed purchase is small. It makes more financial sense to secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John rather than risking further negotiation with Bob."
