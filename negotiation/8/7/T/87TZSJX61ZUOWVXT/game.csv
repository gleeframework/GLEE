"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my price range. I'd be willing to pay $140 for it.  What do you think?",140.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $140 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down to $155. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",155.0,Alice,3,
