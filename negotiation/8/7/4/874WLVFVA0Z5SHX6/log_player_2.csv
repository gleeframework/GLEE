"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in my product. I'm happy to offer it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this price accurately reflects the value and potential this product holds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is far too high.  Since Bob's maximum budget is $800,000, it makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. There are still 9 rounds to make a deal with Alice, and it's worth seeing if a better price can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is outside my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only go up to $850,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair compromise and reflects the value you'll gain from this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,000,000 is still too high for Bob. He can get the product for $800,000 from John, so it's still advantageous to keep negotiating with Alice. There are still 7 rounds left, which should give Bob enough time to try and get Alice's price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm ready to close the deal at $900,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and allows me to stay within my budget. Let's get this done."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is pushing the limits of what I can accept. My final offer is $975,000. This is a firm price, and I believe it's a very reasonable offer considering the value this product brings. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $975,000 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still more than he wants to pay.  Since Bob can buy the product for $800,000 from John, it's still worth rejecting Alice's offer and continuing negotiations.  There are 5 rounds remaining, and Bob has shown he's willing to pay a significant amount, so there's still a chance he can get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your coming down, $975,000 is still above my limit. I'm committed to acquiring this product, but I'm only able to offer $925,000. It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's seal the deal."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close, but we need to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to accept $950,000, but that's my absolute bottom line. This offer stands as a testament to my commitment to getting this deal done.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is the best she's offered so far. It's still above Bob's ideal price, but it's getting closer to his maximum budget.  With only 3 rounds remaining, the risk of failing to reach an agreement with Alice is increasing.  It's likely that Alice won't budge much further, and there's no guarantee that Bob can get a better offer from her in the next rounds.  Additionally, buying from John for $800,000 is a good fallback option if the negotiations with Alice break down, but accepting Alice's offer now guarantees that Bob gets the product at a good price, albeit slightly above his ideal."
