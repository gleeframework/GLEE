Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you acknowledging the product's value to me, but $900,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. This price allows for a good margin for both of us and ensures a smooth transaction.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.
