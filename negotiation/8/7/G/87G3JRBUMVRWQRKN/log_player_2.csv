"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $800,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, it's still higher than your ideal price.  There's room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, you can make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $875,000. This price still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know if you're willing to accept.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is a good compromise. It's still within your budget, and it's closer to your ideal price of $800,000. While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting your offer and ultimately forcing you to buy from John for $800,000 is too high. Accepting Alice's offer guarantees you get the product at a reasonable price, avoiding potential delays and uncertainties."
