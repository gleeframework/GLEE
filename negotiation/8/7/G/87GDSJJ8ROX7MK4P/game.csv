"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of the product.",8200.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $8,200 is significantly below the true value of this product.  To be fair to both of us, I can go down to $9,000. This is my final offer.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to make a profit, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $8,500. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",8500.0,Bob,4,
