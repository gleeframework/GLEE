"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is a bit too low.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This price still leaves room for a good deal for both of us. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. Can we meet at this price?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
