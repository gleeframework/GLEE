Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less than that. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob, given the product is worth more to him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is a bit too low.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This price still leaves room for a good deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a bit more,  $1,025,000 is a good price, and it's better than selling to John or risking further negotiation with Bob."
