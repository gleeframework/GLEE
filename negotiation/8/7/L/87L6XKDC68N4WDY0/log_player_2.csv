**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above my maximum budget of $800,000. There's no reason to accept it at this point.  I'll try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $800000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still confident this product holds significant value.  Let's meet in the middle at $1200000. I believe this price is fair and allows us both to walk away satisfied.  What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to be fair, but $900000 is still a little too low for me.  Let's split the difference again - I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This is a good compromise for both of us, as it's closer to your budget while still reflecting the value of the product.  Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still more than I can comfortably afford. I'm sticking to my offer of $800,000, which is my absolute maximum.
