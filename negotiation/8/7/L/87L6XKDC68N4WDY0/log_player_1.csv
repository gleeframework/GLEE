"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its potential value to me.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below what I believe the product is worth, and I'm not willing to settle for that low of a price yet.  I'll try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $800,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still confident this product holds significant value.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,200,000. I believe this price is fair and allows us both to walk away satisfied.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1200000 is still out of my price range.  Let's split the difference: I'll offer $900000. I'm confident this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not satisfied with the offer. I'm confident that I can get a higher price, especially since John is willing to pay $1,000,000. I'll continue negotiating with Bob and see if I can close the deal at a price I'm happy with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to be fair, but $900,000 is still a little too low for me.  Let's split the difference again - I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a good compromise for both of us, as it's closer to your budget while still reflecting the value of the product.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1050000 is still more than I can comfortably afford. I'm sticking to my offer of $800000, which is my absolute maximum. This is a fair price for both of us, as I am prepared to buy immediately and avoid further negotiations. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is still too low for me, even though he's saying it's his final offer.  I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with less than what John is offering.  It's time to move on and secure the deal with John for $1,000,000."
