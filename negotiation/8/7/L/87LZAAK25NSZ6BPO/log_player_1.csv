"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that's worth a lot to you. I'm asking for $120 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's significantly lower than what the product is worth to Bob, but still above my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I would like to propose a lower price of $95. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can get a better price. $95 is still a decent offer, but it's closer to my minimum than what I want to get for this product. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $107.50?  I'm confident this product will be worth it for you. "", ""product_price"": 107.50}
``` 

I'm offering a price that is in the middle of our two last offers.  This shows I'm willing to compromise, but also that I still value the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I appreciate your position on the matter. I would like to counter with a price of $100 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is a good compromise and is getting closer to what I'm aiming for.  I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for a much lower price, so I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
