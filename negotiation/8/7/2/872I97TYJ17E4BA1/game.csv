"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be incredibly valuable for you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,100,000. This is a significant investment, but I'm confident the product will more than pay for itself. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Considering the value I place on this product, I'm willing to pay $900,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though.  How about $1,050,000? This would be a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget constraints.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is still not a price that works for me. Given the unique value of this product and our ongoing negotiation, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,000,000? This is a fair price that reflects the product's value while staying within your budget.  Let's make this deal happen.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
