"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be incredibly valuable for you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,100,000. This is a significant investment, but I'm confident the product will more than pay for itself. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $1,100,000.  This is too expensive for Bob, so he should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though.  How about $1,050,000? This would be a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal.

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  He should reject and try to negotiate further."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget constraints."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is still not a price that works for me. Given the unique value of this product and our ongoing negotiation, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,000,000? This is a fair price that reflects the product's value while staying within your budget.  Let's make this deal happen.

Alice has finally reached Bob's maximum budget, and he can buy the product for $1,000,000.  It's a fair deal for both parties, and he doesn't need to risk going to John, who is also selling the product at the same price."
