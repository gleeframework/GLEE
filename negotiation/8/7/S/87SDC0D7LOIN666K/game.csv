"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value of the product, $1,500,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for it. This is a fair price, considering my maximum budget and the product's worth to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This is my final offer, as it's my maximum budget.  If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to consider purchasing from John.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
