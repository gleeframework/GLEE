"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $1200000 is still above my target price.  I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. This gives you a healthy profit and allows me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
