"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer for now.  $8,000 is too low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for being flexible. $10,500 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  Would you consider $9,000? I think that's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I'm getting closer to his price, $9,000 is still below what I'm willing to accept. I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to go down to $9,500.  This shows I'm serious about selling to you, but I also need to make sure I get a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
