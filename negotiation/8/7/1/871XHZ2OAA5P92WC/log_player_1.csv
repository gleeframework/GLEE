Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value.  This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters with a lower price. I'll also be watching closely to see if he seems particularly interested, which might indicate he's willing to pay more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's higher than John's offer, it's still lower than my ideal price. I believe I can get closer to my desired price by countering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm countering with $135. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my initial value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's still lower than my ideal price, it's only $5 less than my last counteroffer.  There's a good chance that further negotiation won't get me much closer to my desired price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. $125 is still a good profit margin."
