"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I'm on a budget and need to make sure it fits within my means.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to work with you.  $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm open to coming down to $10,500. This would still be a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. Can you consider that price?",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I want to make this work.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is a significant compromise on my end.  This price reflects the value of the product while being fair to both of us.  Let's make this deal happen.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $11,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I'm not sure I can stretch to that price. Can you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,6,
