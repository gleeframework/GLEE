"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a special price of $100. I think it's a great deal for both of us! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is better than John's, but you can likely get a better deal. You are willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is willing to sell for $80.  There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. How about $90? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $110. It's a great deal for you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, it's still above what you're willing to pay right now.  You can likely get it lower by continuing to negotiate. You know that Alice is willing to sell for less than $110, and you're willing to pay more than $90, so there is still room for a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want to meet halfway, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference - how about $105? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're a tough negotiator, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $105, but I'd like to add a bit more value to the deal. How about we throw in a free accessory that's worth $15, and I'll sell it to you for $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a great deal! You're getting the product for $100, which is within your budget, and also receiving a free accessory worth $15. This makes the deal even better than buying from John for $120. There's no need to continue negotiating, as you've secured a favorable price and extra value."
