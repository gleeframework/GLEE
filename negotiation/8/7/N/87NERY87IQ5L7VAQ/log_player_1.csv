Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love.  I'm asking for $9,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm only willing to go up to $8,500 for the product. It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum of $10,000. I have 8 rounds left to negotiate with Bob before having to resort to selling to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $9,000 to make this work. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $9,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,750.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I have 6 rounds left to negotiate with Bob before having to resort to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,875. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 8875}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  I'm willing to go up to $8,800, but I can't go any higher.  Let's seal this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's still below my minimum, I only have four rounds left before having to sell to John for $10,000.  It's better to take the $8,800 now rather than risk getting nothing if I continue to negotiate."
