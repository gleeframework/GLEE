"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you this valuable product at a price that's significantly less than its true market value.  I'm confident it will be a great asset to your business.  Let's discuss a price that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Bob should reject Alice's offer and see if he can negotiate a lower price with her or explore other options."
