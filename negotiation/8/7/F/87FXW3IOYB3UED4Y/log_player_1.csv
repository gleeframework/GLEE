"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) but lower than what John would pay. This is to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than nothing, it's still lower than my minimum value of $150. I'll try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but I'm still above my minimum value. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not willing to give away the product for significantly less than what I value it at."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my minimum value, I still believe I can get a better price. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I still have a few rounds to try and negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but this time I'm getting closer to Bob's offer. I'm trying to find a compromise where we can both be happy.  I'm also keeping in mind that I have a backup option in John, but I don't want to give up on Bob yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $130 is now above my minimum value of $150.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting this offer ensures a profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
