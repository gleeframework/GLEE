"Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. Given its unique value proposition and potential for significant return, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is quite high. While I recognize the value of this product, I'm only able to offer $1,200,000 at this time. This reflects my budget and the market value for similar products.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the unique benefits this product offers.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,900,000? This reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget.  To demonstrate my commitment to this deal, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my genuine interest in acquiring this product. Let's work together to bridge the gap.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a reasonable price. To expedite this deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This is my final offer, as it reflects the product's true value and the significant return on investment you'll see.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,700,000 is still above my budget. I'm confident that we can find a mutually agreeable price that reflects the value of the product and my financial capacity. I'm prepared to offer $1,600,000. This shows my seriousness about acquiring the product, and it's a price I believe is fair. Let's close this deal.",1600000.0,Bob,6,
