Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This is a starting point.  I've chosen to start high, at $10,000, knowing that I can always come down if needed.  Here's why:

* **Setting a high initial price:** This allows for room to negotiate and potentially get closer to my desired value. 
* **Expressing confidence:**  The message tries to build some perceived value for the product in Bob's eyes.
* **Leaving the door open:**  The message encourages Bob to respond and allows for a dialogue.

Remember, this is a strategy. We need to adapt based on Bob's responses!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. I'm looking to save some money, but I still think the product is worth a significant amount to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm going to try and see if I can push for something a bit higher.  Here's why:

* **Potential for more:**  $8,000 is my minimum, but I'm aiming for more. 
* **Testing Bob's commitment:**  By rejecting, I'm seeing how strongly Bob wants the product.  If he's willing to keep negotiating, it suggests he values it more.
* **Leaving the door open to a counteroffer:**  This keeps the negotiation going and allows me to potentially find a middle ground. 

I'll need to craft a counteroffer in the next round to see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to compromise a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  This still gives you a good price, and it allows me to make sure I get a fair value for the product."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

Here's why I chose this counteroffer:

* **Meeting in the middle:**  This is a common negotiating tactic that shows flexibility and a willingness to find common ground.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm reminding Bob that $9,000 is still a good deal, even if it's a bit higher than his initial offer.
* **Emphasizing fairness:**  I'm framing the counteroffer as a way to ensure both of us get a fair outcome.

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving and gives Bob a clear reason to reconsider his initial offer.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $9000. How about we meet at $8500? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my target price,  $8,500 is a good deal, and I'm not sure I can get much more out of Bob. 

Here's why I'm accepting:

* **Reaching a compromise:** $8,500 is a good middle ground, and I'm happy to close the deal.
* **Bob's commitment:** He's shown a willingness to negotiate and seems committed to getting the product.
* **Time is money:** Continuing to negotiate could drag things out and I might end up with nothing.

It's important to weigh the risks and rewards in negotiation, and in this case, accepting Bob's offer seems like the best option."
