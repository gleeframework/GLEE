"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering the value of the product. However, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
