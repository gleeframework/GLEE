Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had in it, I'm proposing a price of $10,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $12,000, getting Bob to buy it for a slightly lower price still earns a significant profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $10,000 creates a win-win scenario. It's a $2,000 profit over your minimum and a $2,000 saving for Bob compared to its value to him.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By mentioning ""listing it publicly"",  we subtly nudge Bob to act quickly without being overly aggressive."
