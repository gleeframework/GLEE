Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $13000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $11000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price. I can still do better than $11,000."
