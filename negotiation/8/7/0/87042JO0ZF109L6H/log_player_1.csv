Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $850000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $750000.  This seems like a fair price, given the value we're both placing on this product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $750,000 is a decent amount, I'm aiming for a higher price closer to my minimum of $800,000. I believe I can still negotiate a better deal with Bob in the remaining rounds."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down on the price.  $825000 is a good starting point, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price.  How about $780000? This is a fair offer that reflects the value of the product and allows us to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
