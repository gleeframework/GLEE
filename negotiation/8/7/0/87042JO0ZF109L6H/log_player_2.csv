"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a valuable asset and I believe it will be a great addition to your operations. My asking price for it is $850000. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a better price. You have a clear goal to save money, and while buying from John is safe, it doesn't achieve your objective."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $850,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $750,000.  This seems like a fair price, given the value we're both placing on this product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750000 is a bit lower than I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $825000. This takes into account the value we both see in the product, and it gives us a fair starting point for a final agreement.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $825,000 is closer to your ideal price, you still have room to negotiate and potentially save more.  It's worth seeing if you can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming down on the price.  $825,000 is a good starting point, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price.  How about $780,000? This is a fair offer that reflects the value of the product and allows us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 780000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $780000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $800000, which is my absolute bottom line. This price reflects the true value of the product and allows us to close the deal fairly. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has offered her absolute bottom line, which is equal to what you can get from John.  Accepting her offer means you don't have to go through further negotiation, and you get the product at your target price."
