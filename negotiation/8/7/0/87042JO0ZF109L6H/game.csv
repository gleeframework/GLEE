"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $850000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $750000.  This seems like a fair price, given the value we're both placing on this product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750000 is a bit lower than I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $825000. This takes into account the value we both see in the product, and it gives us a fair starting point for a final agreement.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down on the price.  $825000 is a good starting point, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price.  How about $780000? This is a fair offer that reflects the value of the product and allows us to close the deal.",780000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $780000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $800000, which is my absolute bottom line. This price reflects the true value of the product and allows us to close the deal fairly. What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,5,
