Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth to you. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, there's a chance to earn even more from Bob.
* **Strong Opening:** Starting with a price closer to your minimum acceptable value ($1,500,000) leaves less room for negotiation and sets a strong precedent.
* **Respectful but Firm:** The message is polite and emphasizes the product's value, but also makes it clear that the price is non-negotiable.
* **Time Sensitivity (Implied):**  By mentioning an ""exclusive opportunity,"" it subtly hints that Bob might not have unlimited time to decide, encouraging a quicker response. 

**Why this strategy?**

This approach aims to strike a balance between:

* **Securing a deal:**  The price is still significantly attractive to Bob (a potential $400,000 profit for him).
* **Maximizing Alice's gains:** It's a considerable amount above Bob's perceived value, bringing Alice closer to her desired outcome.

This offer sets the stage for a potentially quick and profitable sale."
