"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this reflects its true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer. The product is worth $1,200,000 to him, and Alice's offer is $250,000 higher. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his target price, it's still higher than his maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
