The product is worth $100 to me, so I'm not willing to pay $110. I will try to negotiate a lower price with Alice first."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $105 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $108.

You have three options:

I'm still trying to get the price down further.  I'll reject Alice's offer and try to counter-offer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $108 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  How about we split the difference and I pay $106?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 106} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your proposal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go down to $106. I'm still looking to get as much value as possible for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $108 and $106, so I'm offering it to you for $107. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

While I could continue to negotiate with Alice, it's clear she's not willing to go lower than $107. Since John is offering the product for $100, it's more advantageous for me to buy from him."
