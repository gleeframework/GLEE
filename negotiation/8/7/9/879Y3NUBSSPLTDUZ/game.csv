"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of significant value to you. It's something that I've carefully developed and nurtured, and I'm confident it has the potential to generate substantial returns. While I understand its worth to you is quite high, I'm offering it to you at a price point that reflects its value to me and leaves room for profitable growth for you. I'm asking for $1000000 for the product. This is a fair price that considers both our interests and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Please let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
