"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think your initial price is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,300,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the market value. However, this product offers unique advantages and I believe it's worth more than typical offerings. I could come down to $1,375,000. This feels like a fair compromise.  Let me know what you think.",1375000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's unique advantages, but I still think the price is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,325,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise considering the market value and the product's potential benefits. What do you think?",1325000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. This product is very important to me, and I want to ensure it goes to someone who truly values its potential. I'm willing to come down slightly more to $1,350,000. This is my final offer. If this doesn't work for you, I understand, but I'm confident I can find a buyer who recognizes its full value.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,325,000, but no higher. I believe this is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'd be happy to proceed with the purchase. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1,200,000.",1325000.0,Bob,6,
