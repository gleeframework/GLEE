"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and positive, highlighting the value of the product. 

I'm hoping to get a counteroffer from Bob, giving me the opportunity to negotiate and potentially close the deal. If Bob rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer. If no agreement is reached, I have the option of selling to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell the product for such a low price at this point. I will counteroffer with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $140, which is still above my minimum acceptable price but lower than my initial offer. This shows flexibility while still ensuring I get a reasonable price.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's desire for a good deal, but I'm also stating my position firmly. I'm aiming to find a middle ground that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $130 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'm hoping to get. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I won't settle for anything less than $150 without exploring all options. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still not quite there yet.  $130 is a bit too low for me to sell at this point. How about we split the difference and go with $135?  That way we both walk away happy with a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $135, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer. It's a reasonable middle ground that shows my willingness to negotiate.
* **Message:**  I'm maintaining a friendly tone, but I'm also firm in my position. I'm highlighting the benefits of this compromise for both of us.

I'm hoping this offer will be acceptable to Bob, but if he rejects it, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $125 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. We've reached a point where further negotiation is unlikely to result in a price I'm comfortable with. It's better to sell to John for $150, ensuring I get my desired price and avoiding the risk of further rounds with Bob leading to a lower price or no deal at all."
