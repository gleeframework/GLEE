Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's common in negotiation to start with a higher price than you're willing to accept. This gives you room to negotiate down.
* **Realistic Expectation:** $100 is a good starting point, considering the product is worth $120 to me and $80 to Bob. There's room for both of us to potentially find a mutually acceptable price. 
* **Open Communication:** The message is friendly and inviting, making it more likely Bob will engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Me:**  The product is worth at least $120 to me, so accepting $85 would result in a significant loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:** While $85 is close to Bob's perceived value, there's still room for negotiation. I can likely get a better price than this.
* **Alternative Option:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay $120, which is a much better deal for me. However, I want to see if I can potentially get closer to that price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob!  I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I've moved slightly from my initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Reasonable Price:** $95 is still a good deal for me, as it's above my minimum value of $120.
* **Maintain Leverage:** While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not giving in to Bob's initial offer.  This maintains my negotiating position.
* **Friendly Tone:** The message is polite and encouraging, aiming to keep the negotiation positive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to pay $90 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Value:** $90 is still above my minimum value of $120, making it a financially sound decision.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While I'd prefer to get closer to $100,  there's a risk that Bob will walk away entirely if I continue to reject his offers. 
* **Time Factor:**  Continuing to negotiate might take more time and effort, and I have a guaranteed buyer in John. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential reward of getting a slightly higher price from Bob is outweighed by the risk of losing the deal altogether."
