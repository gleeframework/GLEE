Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, meaning he has a potential profit of $500,000 if he buys from you.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  This exists between $1,000,000 (your minimum) and $1,500,000 (Bob's maximum). Any price within this range could lead to a deal.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept.  Here's a possible approach:

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair. This offer stands for 24 hours."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  Starting at $1,350,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message highlights the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""value"" to entice Bob.
* **Time Limit:** The 24-hour limit creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation is Key:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You'll need to decide how low you're willing to go. 
* **Information is Power:** In a real negotiation, gathering information about Bob's needs and constraints would give you even more leverage."
