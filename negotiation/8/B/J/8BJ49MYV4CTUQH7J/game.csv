"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been carefully crafted to provide exceptional value. It's worth more than $100 to me, but I'm willing to start our negotiation at $150. Would you be interested in discussing this further?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $150 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100 for it at this time.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I appreciate your interest in our product. To find a middle ground, I would like to propose a price of $125. This allows us both to feel satisfied with the transaction. I hope this suggestion is acceptable to you.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. While $125 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  How about $115?  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow me to move forward with the purchase.",115.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're making progress, Bob. Considering your offer, I would like to suggest a price of $110. This still leaves a bit of room for both of us, and I believe it's a fair compromise. I hope you'll find this proposal satisfactory.",110.0,Alice,5,
