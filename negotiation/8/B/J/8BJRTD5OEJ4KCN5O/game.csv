"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, allowing you to acquire a valuable asset while ensuring I get a good price. Let me know what you think!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This would still be a good profit for you, and it's the highest I can go at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $1,050,000? This still gives you a good value for the product, and it allows me to get a fair price. Let's make this happen!",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,000,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to close this deal quickly. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
