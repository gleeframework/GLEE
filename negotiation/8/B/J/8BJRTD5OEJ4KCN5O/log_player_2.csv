"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, allowing you to acquire a valuable asset while ensuring I get a good price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is a good price, it's still above his maximum budget.  He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This would still be a good profit for you, and it's the highest I can go at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $1,050,000? This still gives you a good value for the product, and it allows me to get a fair price. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still slightly above Bob's maximum budget. He can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice. Buying from John would be the best option, but there's still room for improvement with Alice, and Bob might be able to get a slightly better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,000,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to close this deal quickly. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
