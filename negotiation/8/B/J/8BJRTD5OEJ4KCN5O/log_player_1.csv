{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, allowing you to acquire a valuable asset while ensuring I get a good price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This would still be a good profit for you, and it's the highest I can go at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counter-offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $1,050,000? This still gives you a good value for the product, and it allows me to get a fair price. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,000,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to close this deal quickly. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, and I want to close the deal."
