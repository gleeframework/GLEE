"Thanks for showing me the product Alice! I'm interested, but that price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $100 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about $75? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $100 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $90. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  $90 is close, but I'm trying to stick to a tight budget.  Would you be willing to do $80?  That's the absolute most I can offer.",80.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $80 is your absolute limit, Bob. I'm willing to meet you there, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I'll offer it to you for $85. This is my final concession, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",85.0,Alice,7,
