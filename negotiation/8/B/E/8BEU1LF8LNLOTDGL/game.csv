Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for us to work together. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $130. It's a fair price considering its value to you.,130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's value, $130 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $105 for it. Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $115. It's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $115 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $110, which is still a good deal for both of us.  What do you say?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $112.50. It's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",112.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not quite there. $112.50 is closer, but I can only go up to $111. If you're willing to meet me halfway, I'm ready to close the deal.",111.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to get the best deal, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $111. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $112. I'm getting close to my minimum, but I still need to make a profit. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",112.0,Alice,7,
