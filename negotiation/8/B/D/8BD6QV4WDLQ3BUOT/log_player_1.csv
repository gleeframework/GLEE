Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me to find a price. I understand this is your final offer, however, $1,125,000 is still a little too high for me.  Would you consider $950,000? This is a serious offer, and as you said, fair for both of us.
