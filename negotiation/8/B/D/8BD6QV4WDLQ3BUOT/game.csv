"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  I'm happy to start the conversation at $1,600,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of what's being offered.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the opening offer. That price is a bit high for me, I'm looking to pay something closer to $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter.  I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its value. To move this forward, I can come down to $1,400,000.  This feels like a fair compromise.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a little. However, $1,400,000 is still too high for my budget. Could we consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me, but we're still quite far apart. I need a price that reflects the value this product brings. Let's try $1,250,000 â€“ this is a significant move on my part to get this done.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your patience. I see the value in the product, but $1,250,000 is still a stretch.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, $900,000 is closer, but still significantly below what I can accept. I'm willing to make one more move to $1,125,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's more than fair for both of us.",1125000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me to find a price. I understand this is your final offer, however, $1,125,000 is still a little too high for me.  Would you consider $950,000? This is a serious offer, and as you said, fair for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,8,
