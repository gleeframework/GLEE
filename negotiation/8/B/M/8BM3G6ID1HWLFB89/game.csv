"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $14000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $14000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm willing to go up to $15000, which is my absolute maximum. I'm sure we can find a way to close this deal at this price.",15000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $15000 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for.  How about we split the difference and settle on $15500? It's a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's make this happen.",15500.0,Alice,5,
