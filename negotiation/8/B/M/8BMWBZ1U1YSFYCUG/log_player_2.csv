{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $80 to me, and Alice is offering it for $120.  This is way too high. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

I'm offering Alice my maximum price for the product, which is $80.  This is the price I'd be willing to pay to avoid going to John. Let's see if she's willing to meet me halfway."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still too high. I'm not willing to pay more than $80 for the product. I'll reject her offer and see if I can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'll try to split the difference with Alice and offer $85. This is still a good deal for me, and it might be tempting enough for Alice to accept."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $105 is still too high. I'm sticking to my maximum price of $80. Let's see if she'll finally accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

I've made my final offer at $80. I'm not willing to go any higher. Hopefully, Alice sees that it's in her best interest to accept, as she's not likely to find a higher price from anyone else."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $95.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is still not willing to come down to my price. With only a few rounds left, the risk of not finding a deal is too high.  I'll go with John's offer of $80 to guarantee I get the product."
