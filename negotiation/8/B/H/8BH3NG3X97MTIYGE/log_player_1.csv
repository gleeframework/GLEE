Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum value, but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm curious to see how much Bob is willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is better than selling to John, I'm not ready to accept just yet. I believe I can get a higher price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $135.  It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want to get a good price.  Hopefully, this will get us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $125 is getting close to my minimum acceptable price.  It's also a decent increase from his previous offer.  Rather than risk further negotiation and potentially getting a worse offer, I'll accept and sell to Bob."
