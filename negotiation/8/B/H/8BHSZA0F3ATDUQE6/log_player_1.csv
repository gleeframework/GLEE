"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $120 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts at a price significantly higher than my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium, knowing that I can always sell to John for $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the discount, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I would like to propose a price of $90 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can push for a higher price. I'm not yet at a point where selling to John for $80 is the most appealing option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference at $95?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it avoids any further back-and-forth."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
