Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($15,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $14,000 allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Secure a Good Deal:** Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, selling at or above $13,000 is still a significant profit compared to John's offer of $12,000."
