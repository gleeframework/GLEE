Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring I maximize my profit.
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win scenario, emphasizing the value Bob will get and encouraging him to accept. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Initiate negotiation:** By starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, I initiate negotiation without immediately revealing my lower limit.
* **Maximize my profit:** The $1,300,000 offer is significantly higher than Bob's $1,000,000 value, giving me a good starting point for negotiation.
* **Maintain flexibility:** This offer allows me to either accept a counteroffer if it's favorable or fall back on John's offer if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $1,150,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. It's tempting to consider accepting his offer since it's better than nothing, but I'm not willing to settle for such a low price. 

By rejecting his offer, I can:

* **Continue negotiation:** I can make a counteroffer that is more favorable to me, potentially reaching a compromise closer to my desired price.
* **Maintain leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer shows I'm not desperate for a quick sale and that I'm willing to walk away if necessary. This strengthens my position in the negotiation.
* **Maximize profit:** Holding out for a higher price increases my chances of getting closer to my desired $1,500,000, or at least a price closer to my minimum acceptable price. 

The risk of rejecting Bob's offer is that he might walk away. However, since I have John as an alternative buyer, I'm not taking a significant risk."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $1,150,000 is a bit lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, and it allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm counteroffering with a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired amount.
* **Message:**  I acknowledge Bob's counteroffer but emphasize the value of the product and my willingness to compromise. This helps maintain a positive tone and encourages further negotiation. 

By taking this approach, I'm trying to:

* **Strike a balance:**  This counteroffer bridges the gap between our positions, making it more likely that Bob will consider it.
* **Maintain leverage:**  I'm not dropping my price too much, signaling that I'm not desperate to sell.
* **Signal willingness to negotiate:**  The counteroffer shows that I'm open to finding a mutually agreeable solution.

This strategy aims to increase the chances of reaching a deal while still maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1,250,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I'm trying to be fair, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $1,200,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I could continue negotiating, it's likely that we'll be stuck in a back-and-forth with diminishing returns.

Here's why I'm choosing to sell to John:

* **Guaranteed Profit:** John is offering my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't lose money. 
* **Time Savings:**  Negotiating with Bob further could take more time and effort, and there's no guarantee we'll reach a deal.
* **No Risk:**  John is a reliable buyer, and I'm confident in the transaction.

While I'd prefer to make more, selling to John provides a certain outcome with no risk. It's the most sensible option at this point."
