"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1450000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its worth to you and still a substantial profit for me. Let me know what you think!",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping for a price closer to $1300000. This would still give you a good profit and leave me with a comfortable margin.  Let's see if we can reach a deal that benefits both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1300000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1375000? This would still be a great deal for both of us, giving you a good margin and leaving me with a decent profit.  Let's close this deal and move forward.",1375000.0,Alice,3,
