Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping for a price closer to $1300000. This would still give you a good profit and leave me with a comfortable margin.  Let's see if we can reach a deal that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.
