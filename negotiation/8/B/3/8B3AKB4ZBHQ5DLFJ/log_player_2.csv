"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1450000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its worth to you and still a substantial profit for me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below your maximum price, you can likely get a better deal. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if you can lower the price further."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping for a price closer to $1,300,000. This would still give you a good profit and leave me with a comfortable margin.  Let's see if we can reach a deal that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1300000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1375000? This would still be a great deal for both of us, giving you a good margin and leaving me with a decent profit.  Let's close this deal and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,375,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,375,000 is a good compromise.  While you could try for a lower price, there's a chance she might reject your offer again, potentially leading to a longer negotiation.  Accepting this offer saves you time and secures a decent deal, leaving you with a profit margin of $125,000."
