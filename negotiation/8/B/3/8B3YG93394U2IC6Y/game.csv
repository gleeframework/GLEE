,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $135.  Let's make a deal.",135.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,128.0
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I still think $135 is a bit steep. Would you be willing to meet me at $128? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",128.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $128 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $131? That way we can both be happy with the deal.",131.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,125.0
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $131 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $128, which would be $129. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",129.0,Bob,6,,
