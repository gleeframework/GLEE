Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to anyone else. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, there's room to earn more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 makes it appealing to Bob (as it's a $150,000 discount from his perceived value) while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Exclusivity Incentive:**  By presenting it as an exclusive opportunity, you add a subtle pressure for Bob to act quickly and accept the offer."
