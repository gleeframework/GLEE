"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're offering, my budget for this product is closer to $10,000. I'm willing to offer $10,500, which is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. After careful consideration, I am unable to accept your offer of $10,500. However, I am willing to negotiate further. How about we meet halfway at $11,000? This still allows you to acquire the product at a premium value while accommodating your budget constraints.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,750, which is a fair compromise considering the value I'm getting from this product. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're willing to accept.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"After reviewing your latest offer, Bob, I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. I am willing to come down to $10,900 for the product. This still represents a premium value for you while being within a reasonable range for both of us. Please let me know if this offer suits your needs.",10900.0,Alice,5,
