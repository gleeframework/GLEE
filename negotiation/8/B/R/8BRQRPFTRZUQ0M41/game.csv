"I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $140.",140.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $140 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $160? That's a fair price considering the value of the product.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $145 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $155. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't regret it.",155.0,Alice,5,
