"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, we are offering it to you at an exclusive price of $950000. This is a special opportunity tailored for you, considering the significant benefits this product can bring to your business. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing further details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly below the product's worth to her ($1,200,000) and offers a potential for savings for Bob. It's always beneficial to explore negotiating further before resorting to buying from John at the full price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the discounted price, it's still slightly above what I'm comfortable with at this point. Considering the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $800,000. This is a fair price that reflects the potential benefits we both stand to gain from this deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. To better align with your expectations while still ensuring a mutually beneficial transaction, I am proposing a revised price of $850000 for the product. This price reflects the product's value and the benefits it can provide to your business. I hope this proposal will be more acceptable and look forward to your feedback. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer, and at $850,000, the price is now within a reasonable range for both parties.  It's likely that further negotiation will only result in smaller concessions, and potentially risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting this offer secures the product at a significant discount compared to buying from John."
