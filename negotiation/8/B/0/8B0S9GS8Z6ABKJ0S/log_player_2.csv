"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think you'll really love it! I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering it's worth $15,000 to you, and I'm confident you'll get a lot of value out of it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is overpriced. She claims it's worth $15,000 to me, but I've set my maximum budget at $15,000. This suggests she's inflating the perceived value. 
* I have a backup option with John at $15,000. While this is my maximum budget, it's a better starting point for negotiation with Alice.
* By rejecting Alice's offer, I signal that I'm a serious buyer but not willing to overpay. This might lead her to propose a more reasonable price."
