Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, but I'm still not getting the price I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to know that it's worth it for you. I'll sell it to you for $1075000. This is my final offer on this price point, so I hope we can agree on this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is just slightly higher than your last counteroffer, and she's stated it's her final offer.  It's worth accepting this deal since:

* It's within your budget and a significant savings compared to John's offer.
* Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal entirely and forcing you to buy from John at a higher price."
