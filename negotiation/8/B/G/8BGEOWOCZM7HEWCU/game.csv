"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $125? It's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135. This is still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. What do you say?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $135, but I'm still a bit hesitant.  I'm willing to go up to $130.  Let's split the difference.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $130 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $132.50, which is a fair compromise for both of us.  This way, we can both get what we want and move on.  What do you think?",132.5,Alice,5,
