{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hopeful he'll accept, but if he rejects, I'll be ready to counter. I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $150, so I don't want to go too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $125? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum price of $150. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round. I'm confident that I can get closer to my target price by negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135. This is still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $135, but I'm still a bit hesitant.  I'm willing to go up to $130.  Let's split the difference. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is closer to my target price, it's still below the $150 I can get from John. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price by making a counteroffer. I believe I can convince Bob to go up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $130 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $132.50, which is a fair compromise for both of us.  This way, we can both get what we want and move on.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 132.50}
