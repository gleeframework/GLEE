"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. To try to reach an agreement that benefits both parties, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1500000. This is closer to the original price but still allows us to explore a mutually beneficial arrangement. I hope this proposal will be more in line with your expectations.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
