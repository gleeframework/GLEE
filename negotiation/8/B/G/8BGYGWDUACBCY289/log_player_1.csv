Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product.  I think it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $14,500. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** I want to get as close to $15,000 as possible, but I also want to make sure Bob is likely to accept. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this offer is high, it leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate down, making him feel like he's getting a slightly better deal.
* **Alternative in Mind:** I know I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, so I'm comfortable starting high with Bob."
