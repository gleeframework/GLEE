"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price of $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and I'm glad you made a counteroffer. However, I'm not comfortable with the price of $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand that you're making a compromise, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we settle at $700,000? That's a significant jump on my end, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll go a bit lower. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a fair price for the product's value, and I believe it's a good opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,5,
