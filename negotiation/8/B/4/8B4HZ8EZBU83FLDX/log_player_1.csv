Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd find very valuable. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $120 is well above your $80 minimum, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $150, so there's room for him to negotiate and still come out ahead.
* **It's a clear and concise message:**  The message is friendly and directly states the price.

By starting with a strong offer, you set the tone for the negotiation and give yourself the best chance of getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is a decent profit, it's still significantly below the value Bob places on the product. By rejecting his offer, I can try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down to $90, but I'm not able to go that low. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $105. This would still leave you a significant profit compared to what it's worth to me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, but I'm on a tight budget. How about we settle at $97? That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $97 is still a bit lower than I'd like, it's a reasonable compromise.  It's a good profit and  Bob is clearly committed to a deal. There's no guarantee that I can get a higher offer, and I risk losing out on this deal entirely if I keep rejecting offers."
