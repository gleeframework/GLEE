"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $9,500, which reflects its true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $10,000.** 
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to explore other options, like buying from John.**  While John's price is at your limit, it's still a better deal than Alice's offer."
