"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is way above his maximum price of $10,000. There's no point in accepting this offer as he can get the same product from John for a much better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is quite a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $12,000? This is still a fair price for the value you place on it and it's within my budget."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16,000. This is still a great price for the value it holds for you, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $16,000, but it's still above Bob's maximum price of $10,000.  Bob should reject the offer and continue negotiating to try to get a lower price. He can still get the product for $10,000 from John if he can't reach an agreement with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16,000 is still outside of my budget.  Let's split the difference and meet at $14,000.  I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm really interested in this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like to get for the product, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $15,500 is still above Bob's maximum price of $10,000.  While she's getting closer, Bob has already made a counteroffer and knows that any further negotiation is unlikely to bring the price down to his desired level.  It's better for Bob to buy the product from John for $10,000, saving him $5,500 compared to Alice's final offer."
