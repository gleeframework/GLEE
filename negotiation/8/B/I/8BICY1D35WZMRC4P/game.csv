"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'm interested in the product, and I'm happy to pay $9,500 for it.  What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to meet you halfway. How about we settle at $10,250?",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,250 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $9,750.  This feels like a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can come to an agreement.",9750.0,Bob,4,
