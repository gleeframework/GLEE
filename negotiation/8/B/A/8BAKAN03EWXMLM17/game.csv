"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $9,000, which is a great value considering its worth to you is $12,000.",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a little high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,500, which is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $7,750? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to settle at $7,750. I'm willing to go a bit lower than $8,500, so how about we meet at $8,200? It's a great price for a product that's worth $12,000 to you.",8200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close, but I need to see a price closer to my budget. Would you consider $7,900? That's a significant jump from my last offer, showing I'm serious about this.",7900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your seriousness, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $7,900. I'm willing to make one more concession, so how about we meet at $8,100? It's a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you.",8100.0,Alice,7,
