"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! I believe it would be a great fit for your needs.  I'm asking for $11,500. This price reflects the value and quality of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's ideal price. There are rounds remaining, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best course of action to potentially get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000 to make this work. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's find common ground here! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.
