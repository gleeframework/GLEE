"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,280,000, but I think we can do better than that. Let's aim for a price that's closer to my minimum requirement. How about $1,280,000?",1280000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm getting closer to my target price, but I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,260,000? This would allow both of us to be satisfied with the deal. ",1260000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a middle ground. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,260,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,260,000 and my original offer of $1,400,000. Let's aim for $1,320,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to accept it.",1320000.0,Alice,7,
