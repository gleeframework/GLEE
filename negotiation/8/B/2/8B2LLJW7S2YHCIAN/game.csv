"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it at a fair price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $18000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $14000 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $16000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $16000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $15500. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's closer to my budget and still a good profit for you.",15500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $15500. I'm willing to compromise further and sell the product to you for $16500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair deal for both of us.",16500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $16500 is still a little higher than I'd like. I'm willing to offer $15250. This is a reasonable compromise, and I'm sure we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",15250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $16000 again, but this time I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a complimentary service that's worth $1000. So, the total value you'll get is $17000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,7,
