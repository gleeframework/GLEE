"I appreciate your initial offer, but I think the product is worth less than $1,400,000. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to compromise a bit, so I'll counter with $1,250,000.  This price is still fair considering the value of the product, and it allows for some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can make this work.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
