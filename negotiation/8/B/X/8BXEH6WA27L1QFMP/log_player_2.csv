The product is worth $100 to Alice, and she's offering it for $120. This means there's room for negotiation. Rejecting her offer gives you the chance to try and get a better price."

While Alice's offer is closer to my initial goal, I'm still willing to try and negotiate further.  The product is worth less than $150 to me, so I'm not ready to buy from John yet."

Alice's offer of $130 is still within my budget, and I've already gone back and forth a few times.  While I'd love to get it for less, it's getting closer to John's price.  I'm going to accept this offer to avoid further negotiation and ensure I get the product."
