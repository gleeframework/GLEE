Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's in great condition and worth a lot more. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:** $115 is more than what Bob thinks the product is worth, giving him an incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** $115 is still higher than your minimum of $120, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can lower the price a bit if needed without going below your minimum. 

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm not willing to sell at such a loss. It's better to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest but $90 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to be flexible."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
