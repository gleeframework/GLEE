"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $150 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $140. What do you say?",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I can't go lower than $135. How about we split the difference?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're willing to come down to $135, but I'm still a bit too high for me. How about we meet at $130? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm trying to save some money here.",130.0,Bob,4,
