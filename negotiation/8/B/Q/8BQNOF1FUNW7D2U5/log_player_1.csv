Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $800,000 to you, and it's a significant asset that can generate substantial value for your business. I'm confident you'll find it highly beneficial."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I still have 8 rounds to negotiate with Bob, or I can sell to John for $1,000,000 at any time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  However, $900,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's potential value to you, and it gives us both a good deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down to $1,100,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $1,050,000 is a good deal and significantly better than selling to John for $1,000,000.  It's also important to consider that we're already halfway through the negotiation process and there's no guarantee that I'll be able to get a better price in the remaining rounds."
