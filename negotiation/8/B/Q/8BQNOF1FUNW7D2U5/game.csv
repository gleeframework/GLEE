"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  However, $900,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's potential value to you, and it gives us both a good deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down to $1,100,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
