Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'd find it incredibly valuable.  I'm starting with a price of $14,000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,500 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can secure a price closer to my desired value."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, I'm not able to go that low just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,250. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,800 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Although Bob is getting closer, $12,800 is still too low for me. I'm committed to maximizing my profits and believe I can secure a better deal. Selling to John for $15,000 remains the safer option at this point, but I'll keep negotiating with Bob for a couple more rounds to see if I can get him closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $12,800 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This would be a great deal for both of us,  as I'm sure you'll agree."", ""product_price"": 13000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is inching closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied with $12,900. I've already conceded a considerable amount, and I'm confident that I can push for a slightly higher price. Given that I'm approaching the halfway point of our negotiation, I'm still willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get a better offer."
