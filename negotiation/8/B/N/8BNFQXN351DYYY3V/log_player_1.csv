{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is significantly higher than your minimum value, giving you room to negotiate. It also provides a positive and encouraging message to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $4000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $4,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $4,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low.  While it's good to be willing to negotiate, $4,000 is a huge drop from your initial price.  It's better to try and get a more reasonable offer from Bob, or to move on to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $4,000 is far below what I'm looking for, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $10,000? This is a significant price drop from my initial offer, and it's still a great value for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the price drop to $10000, but I'm still a bit stretched. How about $6000? That's the middle ground between our current offer and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $6,000 is closer to your minimum, it's still a significant loss.  You can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob or selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $6,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $8,000. This is a fair compromise and a great deal for you. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about $7500? That's the closest I can get to my budget while still being a bit flexible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $7,500 is getting closer to your minimum, it's still a significant loss.  Since you can get $12,000 from John, it's better to sell to him to maximize your profit."
