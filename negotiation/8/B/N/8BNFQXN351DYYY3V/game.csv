"I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $4000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",4000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $4000 is far below what I'm looking for, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $10000? This is a significant price drop from my initial offer, and it's still a great value for you. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the price drop to $10000, but I'm still a bit stretched. How about $6000? That's the middle ground between our current offer and my budget.",6000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $6000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $8000. This is a fair compromise and a great deal for you. Let's try to reach an agreement.",8000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about $7500? That's the closest I can get to my budget while still being a bit flexible.",7500.0,Bob,6,
