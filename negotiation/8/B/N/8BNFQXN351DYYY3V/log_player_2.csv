Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $4000 is far below what I'm looking for, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $10000? This is a significant price drop from my initial offer, and it's still a great value for you. Let me know what you think.
