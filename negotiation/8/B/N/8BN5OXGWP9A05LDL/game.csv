"Alice, $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for this product. It's a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but the product's value is significantly higher than that for me.  Could you consider $18,000?  I'm willing to be a bit flexible to make this work.",18000.0,Alice,3,
