Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from your minimum desired price of $1,500,000, but it still gives you a profit. It also leaves room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to consider your product, but I think $1200000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly below my minimum desired price of $1,500,000.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to secure a better price closer to my target.  There's a chance I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This price still leaves me with a reasonable profit, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1120000. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has increased his offer, it's still significantly below my minimum desired price of $1,500,000.  I'm not confident I can get a better offer from him, and I'm concerned about the potential for a prolonged negotiation.  Selling to John guarantees me my desired price and a quick transaction."
