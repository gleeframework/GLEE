Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

This offer is a starting point. It's a high price, but leaves room for negotiation.  It acknowledges Bob's potential value for the product while still leaving a significant profit margin for Alice."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is a good deal, it's still significantly lower than what Alice would ideally like to get.  She's willing to negotiate further, but wants to aim for a price closer to her initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Alice is willing to come down a bit, but not too far. This counteroffer shows that she's serious about getting a fair price, while also leaving room for a potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has increased his offer, and it is now at a point where Alice can accept. It's a good deal for her -  $1,250,000 is significantly more than what she could get from John.  While it's not her initial target, it's a good compromise that secures a sale."
