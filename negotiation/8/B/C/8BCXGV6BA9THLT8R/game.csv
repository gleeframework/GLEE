"Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $900,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Let's start with a more realistic offer of $700,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product while giving you a healthy profit.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial asking price.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $775,000. I believe this price is fair to both of us, allowing for a reasonable profit for you and a significant saving for me.",775000.0,Bob,4,
