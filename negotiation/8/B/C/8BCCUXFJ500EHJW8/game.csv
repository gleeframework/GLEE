"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your initial proposal, but $1,100,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  To make this work, I'd need to come in closer to $800,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the value. However, the product's inherent worth and potential benefits warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This offer reflects a significant concession on my part and moves us closer to a mutually beneficial deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point. While I'm still interested, $1,000,000 is still a bit steep. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $900,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
