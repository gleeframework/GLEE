"I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. Can we meet in the middle at $700000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While $700000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still below the value I see in this product. I'm willing to come down to $850000. This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the potential benefits this product offers.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer, so I'll make a counteroffer of $675000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints.",675000.0,Bob,4,
