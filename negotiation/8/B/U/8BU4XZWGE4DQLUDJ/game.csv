"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to offer you the product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",950000.0,Alice,3,
