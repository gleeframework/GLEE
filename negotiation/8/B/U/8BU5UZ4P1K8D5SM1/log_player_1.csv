Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as much as possible from Bob, knowing our minimum is $150.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $120.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is above Bob's valuation, it leaves some space for him to counter-offer. We can always come down a little, closer to $120, if needed.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  We have the security of John who will pay $150, so we're not desperate to accept any offer from Bob. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between getting a good price from Bob and ensuring the product is sold."
