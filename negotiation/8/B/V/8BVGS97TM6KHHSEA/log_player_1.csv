{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, considering the value it brings. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation while still ensuring you can walk away with a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $800,000.  This product is valuable to me, but I'm working with a strict budget. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $800,000 is a better offer than Bob's initial price, it's still far below your minimum acceptable price. There's room for negotiation, and rejecting Bob's offer keeps the possibility of a better deal open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, considering the value this product brings.  It's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
