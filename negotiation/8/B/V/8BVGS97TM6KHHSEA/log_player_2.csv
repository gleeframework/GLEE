"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, considering the value it brings. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 
You should reject Alice's offer.  You can get the product for $800,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept a higher price.  You should counteroffer Alice and see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $800,000.  This product is valuable to me, but I'm working with a strict budget. Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, considering the value this product brings.  It's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

You should buy from John. Alice is still asking for more than you're willing to pay, and you know you can get the product for a lower price from John.  There's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice."
