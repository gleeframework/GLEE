You can do better than $115. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 isn't quite enough for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  I'm flexible on this, but I can't go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

$110 is a good price for you, and it's still lower than what John is offering. It's time to close the deal."
