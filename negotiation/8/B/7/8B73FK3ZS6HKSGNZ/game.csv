"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to come down a bit, $900000 is still a bit lower than what I need.  How about we meet in the middle at $1050000? It's a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit higher on the price. How about we try $950000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $950000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we settle at $1000000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be a valuable asset for your company.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $1000000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950000 and $1000000, so how about $975000?",975000.0,Bob,6,
