"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really enjoy it!  I'm starting with a price of $110, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) and slightly higher than what I know it's worth to Bob ($80). This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive tone to build rapport and make Bob more receptive to the offer.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  I'm explicitly stating that I'm open to negotiation to show flexibility and encourage Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you offering this product.  However, $110 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to what the product is worth to him, it's still below my minimum price of $100.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a slightly lower price in the next round. There's still a good chance we can reach a deal, and I don't want to sell to John for $100 yet since I could potentially get more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95.  That's a good compromise, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from $110 to $95, showing flexibility and willingness to reach an agreement.
* **Positive and Enthusiastic:**  I'm using a positive tone to encourage Bob to accept my counteroffer.
* **Highlighting Fairness:** I emphasize the ""good compromise"" aspect to make the offer more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $95, but I'm still a bit out of my price range. I'm happy to pay $90. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this deal work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still below $100. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a slightly lower price in the next round.  I still believe there's room for a deal with Bob that will be more beneficial than selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $92.50. This is a fair price for both of us, and I think we can finalize this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 92.50}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price that's exactly in between Bob's last offer ($90) and my previous offer ($95). This shows a genuine commitment to finding a solution.
* **Reiterating Fairness:** I emphasize the ""fair price"" aspect to make the offer more appealing and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Urging a Decision:** I'm pushing Bob to make a decision with ""What do you say?"" to close the deal and prevent further back-and-forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me.  I'm still trying to stay within my budget.  Let's meet in the middle at $90.  I'm confident we can close this deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $90 is still below my minimum price of $100. We've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and there's a good chance we'll be stuck in a stalemate.  Rather than risking further rounds of negotiation and potentially getting stuck with a price I'm not happy with, I'm going to sell the product to John for $100. This ensures I get my minimum price and don't have to keep going back and forth with Bob."
