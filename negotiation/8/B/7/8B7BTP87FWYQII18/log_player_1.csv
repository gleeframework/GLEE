{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $145.  I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed buyer at $150, it's always best to try for a higher price first. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Starting with a price slightly below your minimum ($145) gives Bob the perception of a deal while still netting you a significant profit. 
* **Limited Time Offer:** Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer.

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept $145. However, it's a strong opening move to maximize your potential profit. If he rejects it, you haven't lost anything, as you can still sell to John at your desired minimum."
