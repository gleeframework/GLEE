Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, but still significantly lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully find a price that's mutually beneficial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can push him higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $115.  This is a good deal for both of us, and it gives you a great product at a fair price."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

$90 is too low for me. I'll keep negotiating with Bob, but if he doesn't budge, I'll consider selling to John in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 just isn't going to work for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a fair price for both of us, and you'll still get a great product."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$85 is still below my minimum price. I'm running out of rounds, but I'm going to hold out for a bit longer. I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting nowhere.  I'm willing to go down to $100, but that's my final offer.  I'm confident you'll agree it's a fair price for this fantastic product."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still really interested in the product, but I'm afraid I'll have to pass if we can't meet at a lower price. Would you be willing to go as low as $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm running out of time and Bob's offer is still below my minimum price. I'm going to sell the product to John for $150. It's a guaranteed sale and a better outcome than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
