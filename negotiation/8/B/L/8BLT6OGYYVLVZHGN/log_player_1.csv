Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $12,000. This is a limited-time offer, so let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob. 
* **High Starting Point:** Starting at $12,000 leaves room for negotiation while staying significantly above your minimum.
* **Sense of Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, potentially justifying the price in his mind.
* **Urgency:** The ""limited-time offer"" adds a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob towards a quicker decision.

**Important Note:**  This is just one strategy. You could choose to start lower, aiming for a quicker sale, or employ other negotiation tactics."
