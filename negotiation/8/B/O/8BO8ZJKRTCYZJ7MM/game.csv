"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product,  $12000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $11000. This is a fair middle ground, considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9000.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. Let's try to reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10200 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. How about we split the difference and agree on $10000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident this will close the deal.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $10000. I'm willing to meet you at $10500, which is still a compromise on my part. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,7,
