Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start with a higher asking price in negotiations. This leaves room for potential negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message emphasizes the product's value, subtly justifying the higher price. 
* **Backup Plan:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, you're not pressured to accept anything less. This allows you to be firmer in your negotiation with Bob."
