Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. This would still leave you with a significant profit, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
