# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. This would still leave you with a significant profit, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in the product."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise again. However, $1,025,000 is still slightly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're close to an agreement, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,012,500. This is still a significant discount from the original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,012,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,012,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made a significant concession and is now very close to my target price.  While I'd still like to try and get a lower price, I'm concerned that if I reject the offer, Alice might not be willing to negotiate further, and I might end up having to buy from John for a much higher price. 

It's a calculated risk, but I think it's worth accepting the offer at $1,012,500. I've saved a significant amount of money compared to John's price, and I've secured a product that's valuable to me."
