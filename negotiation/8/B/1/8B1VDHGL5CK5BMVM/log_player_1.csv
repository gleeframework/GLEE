"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I believe this price is fair considering its market value and my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective. However, $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the unique benefits this product offers. I'm willing to meet you halfway and come down to $1,300,000. This is my final offer."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still above what I can comfortably afford. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to pay $1,250,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering our previous discussions.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is a strong deal. It surpasses my minimum by $250,000 and avoids the risk of drawn-out negotiations or Bob walking away."
