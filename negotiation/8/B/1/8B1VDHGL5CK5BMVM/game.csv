"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product.  Given its unique value proposition, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair.  What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I believe this price is fair considering its market value and my budget. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective. However, $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the unique benefits this product offers. I'm willing to meet you halfway and come down to $1,300,000. This is my final offer.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still above what I can comfortably afford. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to pay $1,250,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering our previous discussions.  What do you say?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
