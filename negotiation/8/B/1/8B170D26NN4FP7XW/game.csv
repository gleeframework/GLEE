"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $12,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $16,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm ready to close the deal, but I'm only able to offer $14,000 right now. I'm confident that this is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad you're willing to close the deal. However, $14,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $17,000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",17000.0,Alice,5,
