Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **My minimum acceptable price:** $10,000 (because that's what I can get from John)
* **Bob's maximum acceptable price:** $8,000
* **My offer:** $9,500 

This offer is a compromise that gives Bob a good deal (saving him $500 compared to buying from John), while still allowing me to earn almost my minimum price."
