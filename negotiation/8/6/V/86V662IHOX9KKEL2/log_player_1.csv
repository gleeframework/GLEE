Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $95."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $100, there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($80) and John's offer ($80).
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering it at $95 tempts Bob with a $5 discount while still securing a significant profit for you.  
* **First Refusal:**  Offering it to Bob first at a slightly discounted ""exclusive"" price can encourage him to act quickly."
