"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $160. Would you be interested in that price?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $160 is still too high for me. How about we split the difference and I pay $120?",120.0,Bob,4,

"I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $120, Bob. I'm willing to compromise at $140, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to come down, but $140 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm sticking with my offer of $120.  If you can't come down to that, I'm going to have to go with John's offer.",120.0,Bob,6,
