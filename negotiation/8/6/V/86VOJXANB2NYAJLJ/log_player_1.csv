Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to both parties, starting at $1,500,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significant profit.
* **Exclusive Opportunity:**  Framing the offer as ""exclusive"" adds perceived value and might make Bob more inclined to accept a higher price.
* **Confident Tone:** Expressing confidence in the product's value reinforces the justification for the price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message encourages Bob to respond and potentially negotiate, keeping the door open for a mutually agreeable outcome. 

**Important Note:** There's always a risk that Bob will reject a high offer. However, with John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, Alice is not under pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
