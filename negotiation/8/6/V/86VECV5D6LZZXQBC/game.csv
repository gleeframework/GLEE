"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $1,200,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay up to $850,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a little more than I can comfortably spend. I'm really keen on this product, so I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential benefits of the product. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stretch your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
