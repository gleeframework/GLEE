$1,200,000 is too high for Bob's budget. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business.

While $1,100,000 is better than the previous offer, it's still outside Bob's budget.  He should continue negotiating to see if he can get the price closer to his limit."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a little more than I can comfortably spend.

What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stretch your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.

While $1,050,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his limit.  He has a guaranteed deal with John for $800,000, making it the best option at this point.  He can save $250,000 by going with John."
