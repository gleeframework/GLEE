"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a one-time offer to you at $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the market value is much higher. I'm willing to give you a discount because I think you're a serious buyer and I want to make a deal happen. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

```

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  $950,000 is significantly lower than $1,500,000.
* **You're still saving money:** Even though you're paying more than the product's value to Alice ($800,000), you're still getting a good deal compared to John's price."
