Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

This counteroffer is a significant step towards Alice's last offer. It demonstrates that I'm willing to compromise and potentially close the deal.  At this point, I am assuming Alice is also looking to close the deal. It's unlikely she'll make a counteroffer that is significantly lower, but I'm willing to risk it to save more."
