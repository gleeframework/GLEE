Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is a significant profit for me, and it leaves room for potential negotiation. I'm confident that Bob will be willing to pay a premium for the product, as it's worth $1,200,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a good price, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate but also demonstrating that I believe the product is worth more than Bob's last offer.  I'm hoping this will be a sweet spot for both of us."
