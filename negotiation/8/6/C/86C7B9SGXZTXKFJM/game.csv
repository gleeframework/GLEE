"I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. Can you meet me at that price?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $9500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11000. This price still reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $11000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9500 and $11000, so I'll offer $10250. Can you consider that?",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10250 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $10750. This price is a fair compromise and reflects the value of the product.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I'm comfortable with $10750, Alice. I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to try to meet you in the middle again, so I'll offer $10375. Can you consider that?",10375.0,Bob,6,
