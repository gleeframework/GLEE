I'm starting with a price of $1,750,000.  This is a good starting point as it's a significant amount above my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob is serious about buying."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to accept a price that's significantly below my minimum. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,600,000. This is still above my minimum, but it shows I'm willing to compromise. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price considering his initial counteroffer was too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is now significantly below my minimum.  I'm not willing to go lower, and I don't think he's going to come up to a reasonable price. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $1,500,000."
