Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product,  $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 13000}
