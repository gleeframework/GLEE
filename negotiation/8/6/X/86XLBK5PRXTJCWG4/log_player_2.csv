"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a one-time offer, and I think it's a fair price considering its value to you is $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is using some sales tactics to inflate the perceived value, her offer of $1,400,000 is still less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and significantly less than John's offer. It makes sense to accept the best deal available."
