Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and a potentially higher profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $950,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still leaves him with a potential ""deal"" if he values it higher in the future or can leverage it for greater returns. 
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning other buyers creates urgency, making Bob less likely to stall or lowball. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale with Bob at a price significantly above his perceived value and the risk of him rejecting the offer."
