"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is lower than the $12,000 you'd pay John.  This saves you $2,500. It's a good deal for you, even though it's still above the product's value to Alice."
