Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,500,000) as possible without losing him to John, our backup buyer.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,300,000 leaves a significant profit margin for you while still offering Bob a substantial discount compared to his perceived value.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested buyers"" encourages Bob to act quickly and increases the perceived value of the product.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing the sale."
