"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for a product we both know has the potential to be worth even more. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning the negotiation with a strong offer slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming to secure a price significantly above my minimum ($1,000,000).
* **Justification:** I've included a brief justification emphasizing the product's value. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone is friendly and invites Bob to engage in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. This product is valuable, but I need to stay within a realistic budget.  How about we bring it down closer to $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is above my absolute minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I believe I can get. I'm willing to negotiate, but not to that extent this early in the process. I believe I have leverage as Bob clearly sees the value in the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I believe the value of this product is significantly higher than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1,100,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate but holds firm to a price point significantly above my minimum.  
* **Justification:** Framing the price as a ""fair compromise"" makes it more appealing while subtly anchoring the value around the higher figure.
* **Sense of Urgency:** While I haven't explicitly mentioned it, every round brings me closer to potentially selling to John for a guaranteed $1,000,000.  This underlying pressure allows me to be firmer in my negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,070,000. This is a strong offer, and I hope we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,070,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, which shows he's still very interested.  We're getting closer, but I believe I can still push for a slightly better price. The risk of him walking away is relatively low at this stage, and I still have John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's close this deal. I'm willing to come down to $1,090,000. This is my final offer, as I need to consider other potential buyers if we can't find an agreement here."",
""product_price"": 1090000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making it clear this is my final offer to create a sense of urgency and signal I'm firm on this price.
* **Justification:** I'm not heavily justifying the price at this point, as we've already established the product's value. 
* **Slight Concession:** By coming down $10,000, I'm showing flexibility but also indicating that my price is firm.
* **Alternative Option:**  Subtly mentioning ""other potential buyers"" reminds Bob that I have other options if he doesn't take this deal.

This strategy aims to secure a price that is significantly above my minimum while still being appealing enough for Bob to accept and close the deal."
