"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  While I can't disclose all the details yet, it's worth at least $1000000 to me.  I'm offering it to you at a special price of $1500000.  This is a one-time opportunity to acquire a truly remarkable asset.  Let me know if you're interested in learning more. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering the product at your maximum budget.  There's no incentive to buy from her since you can get the same product from John for the same price.  By rejecting, you might be able to negotiate a better deal with Alice or find another seller with a lower price."
