"I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,350,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and aim for $1,250,000.  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a fair price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I think $1,300,000 is the minimum I can accept. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
