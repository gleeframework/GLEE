"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I believe it's worth considering a price of $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can definitely get a better price than $1,200,000. Alice values the product at $1,200,000, so you have room to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."

{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Given the product's value, I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,350,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. You can likely secure a lower price than $1,350,000.  Rejecting the offer gives you the chance to make another counteroffer and see if you can get a better deal."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and aim for $1,250,000.  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a fair price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I think $1,300,000 is the minimum I can accept. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is within your budget and represents a significant saving compared to John's price of $1,500,000. It's likely that further negotiations will only result in small price changes.  Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a good price and avoids the risk of further negotiations potentially driving the price up."
