"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to me, but I understand its value might be around $100 to you. Let's work together to find a fair price. How about we start at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $110 is a decent price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $100.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This is a tactic to create room for negotiation and see if Alice is willing to come down.  It's still within Bob's budget, but it leaves space for potential compromises in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about I bring the price down to $105? This still allows us to both feel satisfied with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered the price to $105, it's still outside of Bob's ideal budget.  He has a few rounds remaining and can potentially get the price down to his target of $100.  He can also choose to buy from John at any time, so there's no pressure to accept this offer yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price, but $105 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. This would allow us to finalize the deal quickly and avoid further rounds of negotiation."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering his maximum price. This demonstrates a firm commitment while still showing flexibility and willingness to finalize the deal.  The message emphasizes the potential for a quick resolution and avoids putting the entire burden of compromise on Alice."
