"I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay that price for it.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $105? It's still a great price for the product, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit higher than $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose $97.50. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to consider your proposal, but I think $97.50 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet at $102? It's a good compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting.",102.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to making a decision, but I'd like to try to get a bit closer to my target price. How about we meet at $98? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",98.0,Bob,6,
