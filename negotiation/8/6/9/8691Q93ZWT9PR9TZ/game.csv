"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $17,000, which is a fantastic deal considering its value. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you reaching out. However, $17,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $14,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value and allows for a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you.  $12,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to close this deal. Let me know if you're interested.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,000 is still a bit above what I can afford right now.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000 for the product.  This would be a fair compromise, and we can close the deal.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,6,
