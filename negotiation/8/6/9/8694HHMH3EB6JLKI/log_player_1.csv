Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This is a good starting point.  It's a high price, but still leaves room for negotiation and ensures you get a significant profit. Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response and the possibility of selling to John as a backup."
