"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing [product description] and I think you'd really love it! I'm asking for $200 for it, but I'm open to negotiation."", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Openness:** I'm stating I'm open to negotiation to encourage Bob to counteroffer and potentially reach a good price for both of us.
* **Product description:**  I'm including a brief description to pique Bob's interest and make him think about the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  While Bob's initial offer was low, he expressed interest in the product. This suggests there's potential for negotiation, and I can try to get a better price. 
* **More rounds available:**  With 9 rounds remaining, I have time to try to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about we settle on $170?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 170} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer, but I'm also showing flexibility by counter-offering. This keeps the negotiation going.
* **Mid-ground:**  My counter-offer of $170 is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a positive tone in my message to make the negotiation feel more collaborative."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $170 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider a price of $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above my minimum:**  While $140 is closer to my minimum of $150, it's still not quite there. 
* **Negotiation continues:**  Bob is showing persistence and willingness to negotiate, indicating there might be room to reach a deal within my acceptable range.
* **Time for a counteroffer:** With 6 rounds left, I have time to make another counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $140 is very close, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product. How about we split the difference and go with $145? That would be a great price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Almost there:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still not quite there. 
* **Splitting the difference:** This shows a willingness to compromise and move towards a middle ground.
* **Emphasizing a win-win:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a ""great price"" for both of us to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $145 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We are down to the 6th round, and while I'm still open to negotiation, Bob's offers have consistently been below my minimum.
* **Risk of losing more:**  If I continue negotiating and Bob rejects my next offer, I risk ending up with a lower price or running out of rounds. 
* **Guaranteed outcome:** Selling to John for $150 guarantees me my minimum desired price and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob."
