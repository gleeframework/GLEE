Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high ($11,500) allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Psychological Pricing:** The price ending in ""500"" might make it seem more appealing than a round number like $12,000.

This offer aims to get you the best possible price while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
