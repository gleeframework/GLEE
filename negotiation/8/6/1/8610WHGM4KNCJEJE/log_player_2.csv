# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than the $12,000 value to her, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to secure the product from John for a price within his budget."
