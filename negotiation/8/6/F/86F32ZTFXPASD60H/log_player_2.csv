Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but I have to be realistic about the value of this product. $9,000 is my final offer - it's a significant discount and I think it's more than fair.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

While Alice is coming down, it's unlikely she'll go below $9,000.  It's better to secure the product from John at $8,000 and avoid further negotiation."
