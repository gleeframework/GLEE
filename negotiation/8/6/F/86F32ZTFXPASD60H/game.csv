"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $6,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $10,500 is still a bit high for my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $7,500?  I think that's a fair price.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but I have to be realistic about the value of this product. $9,000 is my final offer - it's a significant discount and I think it's more than fair.",9000.0,Alice,5,
