"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the potential benefits it holds for you.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, $1,100,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a significant gap from what I believe the product is worth. I could consider a price of $1,050,000. This still allows you to benefit significantly from the product while reflecting its true value.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that balances the value of the product with my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and willingness to find a compromise.  While I'm committed to getting this product in the right hands, I can't go as low as $950,000. My final offer is $1,025,000. This is a considerable investment for you, but I believe the product's value justifies it.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
