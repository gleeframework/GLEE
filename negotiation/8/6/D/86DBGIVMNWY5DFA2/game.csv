"Bob, I have a truly unique product I believe you would be interested in. Its value to me is significant, exceeding $1000000.  I'm confident it holds immense potential for you as well.  To begin our discussion, I'm offering it to you for $1500000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident this is a fair starting point.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, $900000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I need to stay above $1000000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm offering $1200000.  This reflects the product's true value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, but $1200000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1100000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
