"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you.  It's worth at least $1000000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's still very fair to both of us.  Let's talk about a price of $950000. This is a significant opportunity for you, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  Alice is offering the product for $950,000, which is $50,000 less than what John is asking.
* **You have a potential profit.** Even though Alice believes the product is worth $1,000,000 to you, you are only willing to pay up to $1,000,000.  By accepting Alice's offer, you save money and potentially make a profit if the product truly is worth that much to you."
