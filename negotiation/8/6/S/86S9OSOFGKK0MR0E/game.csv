"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit outside of my budget though. Would you be willing to come down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $10,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities. I could consider $17,000, which is a more reasonable compromise.",17000.0,Alice,3,
