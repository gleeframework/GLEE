Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its features and value, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I'm confident you'll find this a worthwhile investment."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit outside of my budget though. Would you be willing to come down to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum, and closer to his perceived value than mine.  I need to steer him higher. I'll counter, but I'm prepared to walk away.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $10,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities. I could consider $17,000, which is a more reasonable compromise."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but $17,000 is still too high for me. Could we meet somewhere in the middle, say $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","While closer, Bob is still significantly under my minimum. It's time to walk away.
