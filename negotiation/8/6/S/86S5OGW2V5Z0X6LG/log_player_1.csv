"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $80 for the product. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $80 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $80 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $90 to make this worthwhile.  Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product, I would like to propose a price of $85. This would allow us to reach an agreement within my budget while still providing you with a reasonable return for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $85 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still have 6 rounds remaining and I'm not desperate. I'm going to keep pushing for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. How about $90?  It's a fair price considering the quality of the product, and it gives you a good deal too.  Let's close this out."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I've been considering our previous discussions and I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I would like to propose a price of $87 for the product. This allows us to stay within my budget while also providing you with a fair return for your efforts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're down to 4 rounds remaining and Bob's offer of $87 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. It's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob, especially since I have a guaranteed sale to John for $100.  I'm going to take the sure thing and sell to John."
