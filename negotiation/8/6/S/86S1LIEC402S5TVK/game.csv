"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for the product.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering you a counteroffer of $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a little ways off from that price point.  Would you be willing to consider $760,000?",760000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting closer to your price point, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm offering you a counteroffer of $795,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise.",795000.0,Alice,5,
