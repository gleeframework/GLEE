"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get it for even less by negotiating with Alice. It's also important to remember that Bob has a fallback option of buying from John for $10,000, providing a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product,  $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:** Bob starts with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still higher than his maximum budget with John. 
* **Justifying the Offer:** Bob explains his counteroffer by mentioning his budget constraints, acknowledging the value of the product, and demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Goal:** The goal is to find a middle ground while still saving money. If Alice rejects this counteroffer, Bob can decide whether to go back and forth again or purchase from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $10500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $11250? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Compromise:** Alice has lowered her price significantly, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Value vs. Risk:** While $11,250 is higher than Bob's ideal price, it's still lower than his maximum budget with John. 
* **Minimizing Risk:** Continuing to negotiate could lead to more counteroffers and potentially higher prices, especially if Alice becomes less willing to compromise. 
* **Certainty vs. Uncertainty:** Accepting Alice's offer guarantees Bob the product at a price within his budget.  Further negotiation introduces uncertainty and the risk of a worse outcome."
