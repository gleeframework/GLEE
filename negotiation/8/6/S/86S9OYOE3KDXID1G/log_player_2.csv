It's time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Alice is firm:** Her language suggests she won't go lower than $7,400.
* **Time is ticking:**  You're reaching the later rounds, and further haggling might not be productive.
* **Savings are good:**  You're still getting a $600 discount compared to John's price. 

While you could try to push for a slightly lower price, it's risky. Alice might not budge, and you'd end up paying John's price anyway."
