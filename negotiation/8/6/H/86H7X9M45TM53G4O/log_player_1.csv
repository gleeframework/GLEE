Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially make a larger profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's reaction to this initial high price will give you valuable information. If he accepts immediately, you know you could have gone even higher. If he rejects, it opens the door for negotiation.
* **Backup Plan:** You have John as a guaranteed buyer at $80, so there's no risk of losing money. This allows you to be more ambitious in your initial offer to Bob."
