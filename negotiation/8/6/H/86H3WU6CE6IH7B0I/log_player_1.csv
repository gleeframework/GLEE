Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1400000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1200000.  This price is fair and reflects the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

How about we meet in the middle at $1250000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a good profit and me to acquire the product at a value I'm comfortable with.
