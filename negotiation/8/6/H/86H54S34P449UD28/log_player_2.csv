"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1400000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and still leaves me with a significant profit. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is below your maximum price of $1,500,000 and leaves you with a $100,000 profit. This is a better outcome than buying from John and paying the full $1,500,000."
