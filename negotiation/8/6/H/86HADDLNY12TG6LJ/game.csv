"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, $800000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $650000 for it, as I believe this reflects its fair market value.  Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to sell at $650000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $725000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $725000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $700000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value we've discussed.  This represents a significant reduction from your original asking price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this level.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to reach a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable selling at $700000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer $750000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $750000 is closer, it's still a bit above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $720000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the value we've discussed and the progress we've made.  I'm confident this is a price we can both agree on, allowing us to close this deal.",720000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to reach a fair price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable selling at $720000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer $740000. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. What do you think?",740000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your final offer and your willingness to negotiate. However, $740000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to offer $730000. This is a significant reduction from your initial asking price, and I'm confident it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. I hope we can reach an agreement at this level to finalize the deal.",730000.0,Bob,8,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to reach a fair price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable selling at $730000.
