Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000 is a good starting point.** It's significantly less than what I would get from John, but still a good profit for me. 
* **The message is friendly and emphasizes the value to Bob.** This can increase the likelihood of him accepting the offer.

**Why this approach?**

This strategy is based on maximizing my chances of getting the best possible price while also considering the risk.  Here's why it's a good approach:

* **Higher than Bob's valuation:** Offering $12,000 still leaves Bob with a $4,000 surplus, which makes the offer attractive. 
* **Lower than my reservation price:**  If Bob rejects, I'm still guaranteed $15,000 from John.
* **Potential for negotiation:**  If Bob counters, I can potentially negotiate a higher price.

**Important Note:** This approach assumes a rational buyer in Bob. If he's emotionally attached to the product or has a high ""willingness to pay"" (even if it doesn't make financial sense), he might accept a higher price."
