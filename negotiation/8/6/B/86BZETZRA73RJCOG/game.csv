"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product that's worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $700,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $825,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, and I'm willing to meet you closer to your price.  Would you consider $750,000 for the product?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me closer to my price. However, $750,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $850,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I can tell you're motivated to make a deal, and I am too.  How about we split the difference and settle at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $775,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Let's try $825,000, and I'll throw in some additional perks to sweeten the deal. This is my final offer, and I'm confident we can make it work.",825000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, you drive a hard bargain! I appreciate the perks and your willingness to compromise.  To be honest, $825,000 is a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to make one final push.  If you're willing to come down to $800,000, we have a deal.",800000.0,Bob,8,
