"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $110 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that 110 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at 100? It's a great price for a fantastic product like this.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice, but $100 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm really only able to go up to $95. It's the absolute most I can afford right now. Let me know what you think.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that 95 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at 98? It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for a product like this.",98.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $98 is still above my limit. Let's split the difference - I'll pay $96.50, and it's a deal. What do you say?",96.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that 96.50 is a bit of a compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. How about we meet at 97? It's a small concession, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",97.0,Alice,7,
