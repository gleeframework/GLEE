"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  While it's tempting to save $10 from John, you can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  You have 10 rounds, so there's time to haggle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $110 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that 110 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at 100? It's a great price for a fantastic product like this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above your budget. You can try to get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. You have 8 rounds left, so there's still plenty of time to haggle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice, but $100 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm really only able to go up to $95. It's the absolute most I can afford right now. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that 95 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at 98? It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for a product like this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $98
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice has come down in price, $98 is still outside your budget. You have 6 rounds left, so there's still time to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $98 is still above my limit. Let's split the difference - I'll pay $96.50, and it's a deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 96.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that 96.50 is a bit of a compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. How about we meet at 97? It's a small concession, but I think it's still a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice has come down to $97, but that's still above your budget. You have 4 rounds left, but the negotiation isn't moving fast enough to get you a deal you want.  You're at a point where it's likely you can get a better deal by simply buying from John for $80."
