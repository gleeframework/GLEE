We're still significantly above John's offer, and we have room to negotiate. Let's see if Bob is willing to go higher."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $890,000, but no higher. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:

While we could push for more, accepting $890,000 is a good outcome. We're securing a price significantly above our fallback option (John's $800,000 offer).  Bob seems to have hit his limit, and we don't want to risk him walking away at this stage."
