"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $1,050,000? This would still be a good profit for you, and a great deal for me. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to get a good deal, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about $1,100,000? This still leaves a significant profit for both of us.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both parties.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.  Let's close this deal.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to come up in price.  However,  $1,075,000 is still a bit below what I need.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,087,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we could finally close this deal.",1087500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,087,500 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference again and go with $1,081,250. This would allow for a very good profit for you, and still save me a significant amount. Let's try to come to an agreement.",1081250.0,Bob,6,
