"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  $950,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save as much as possible.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  This price is still significantly higher than your valuation and allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it's still a significant discount from its true value. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  What do you say?",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $875,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,5,
