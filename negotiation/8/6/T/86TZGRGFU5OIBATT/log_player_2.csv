"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price.  Since Bob has a higher budget than Alice's valuation, there's an opportunity to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it's still a significant discount from its true value. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob can still potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows him to make another counteroffer and potentially get closer to his desired price.  He still has a significant buffer between Alice's offer and his budget, making further negotiation worthwhile."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $875,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. What do you think?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is very close to Bob's last counteroffer of $850,000.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to accept the offer and secure the product.  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate, and Bob risks losing the product to another buyer or being forced to buy from John at a significantly higher price.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to achieve a good price while ensuring he gets the product."
