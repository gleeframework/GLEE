"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love! I'm asking for $160 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 160}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good starting point in the negotiation.  Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering! $160 seems a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to sell for a price that's below my minimum.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $140. Let's try to find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm still aiming to get as close to my desired price as possible, but I'm also willing to make a concession to show good faith. I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm serious about making a deal with him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about $115? That's a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, $115 is still too low for me. I'm not desperate to sell to him, and I'd rather keep negotiating to see if we can reach a more agreeable price.  John is always an option, but I want to give this deal with Bob another shot."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're trying to find a compromise, but $115 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and meet at $127.50?  It's a fair price that's closer to both of our desired amounts."", ""product_price"": 127.50}
```

I'm trying to be reasonable and meet Bob halfway.  The price is still above my minimum, but it's a compromise that could be a good deal for both of us."
