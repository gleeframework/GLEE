Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $140. Let's try to find a middle ground here.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you're trying to find a compromise, but $115 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and meet at $127.50?  It's a fair price that's closer to both of our desired amounts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $127.5

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

While Alice is getting closer to my price, going back and forth might not result in a better deal.  It's time to cut my losses and get the product for $120 from John."
