Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price that is higher than my minimum value, but still reasonable. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$90 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm not willing to sell for that low of a price. I will counteroffer Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm lowering my price to $130, which is still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. I hope this counteroffer is appealing enough for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $100 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'm not willing to risk further negotiation with Bob, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price."
