Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a good starting point because it's below Bob's perceived value of $15,000 but still above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's counteroffer is within my acceptable range, and it's closer to my initial offer than my minimum price.  Accepting his offer guarantees a sale and secures a profit of $1,500.  It's not ideal, but it's a good outcome considering the risk of further negotiation."
