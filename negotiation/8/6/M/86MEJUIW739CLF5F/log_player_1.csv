"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know its value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but not too far off. This allows for some negotiation room while still aiming for a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can come to a more equitable arrangement. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $750000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $800,000. I'll counteroffer and try to negotiate a better price. I still have 8 rounds left, so there's time to work out a more profitable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be compensated fairly. I'm offering $850,000. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value I place on the product, I would like to propose a price of $825000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $825,000 is above my minimum acceptable value of $800,000 and is a good compromise. It's worth accepting this offer as it ensures a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiations that could lead to a lower price or a deal falling through."
