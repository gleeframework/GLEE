{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product,  $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the product's potential value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I understand that $850000 is your maximum budget. However, I have to consider the value of the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $1000000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum selling price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, $1,000,000 is still above your budget.  You want to save as much money as possible and still have rounds to negotiate. Rejecting the offer and counter-offering again is the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to pay $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring the product, and it's the best I can do within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this price."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad to see you're willing to meet me halfway. However, I still need to make a profit, and $900000 is not enough for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to lower the price to $1050000, which is a $50000 reduction from my previous offer. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price again, $1,050,000 is still too high for Bob's budget.  There are still 5 rounds left to negotiate, so it's best to keep rejecting and counter-offering to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $950,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects my sincere interest in the product. I believe this price is fair considering the product's value to both of us. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your continued interest, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to meet you at $975000, which is $25000 below my previous offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum selling price. I'm getting close to my limit, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Although Alice has lowered her price to $975,000, it is still above Bob's budget. With only 3 rounds left, the chances of getting a better price from Alice are slim.  Considering Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, the best option is to buy from John for $800,000.  This guarantees the lowest price and secures the product within Bob's budget."
