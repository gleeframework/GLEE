"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below the value it holds for you and significantly above my minimum asking price. Let's make this happen!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000. This still leaves you a healthy profit and is a much better deal for me. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. Let's compromise at $950,000.  This still represents a significant profit for you, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer.  I'm still looking for a price closer to $900,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us and we could close this deal. What do you say?",900000.0,Bob,4,
