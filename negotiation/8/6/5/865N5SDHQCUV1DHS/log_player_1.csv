Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm very interested in your product, and I'm prepared to offer you $900,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. What do you think?
