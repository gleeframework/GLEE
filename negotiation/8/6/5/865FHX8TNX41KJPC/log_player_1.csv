I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is higher than my minimum value of $8,000, giving me some room for negotiation. I believe it's a fair starting point, considering I don't know Bob's valuation of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob's offer is below my minimum value. I will reject his offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering $9,000. This is a compromise between my minimum value and Bob's offer. I hope this will encourage him to agree to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

Bob's offer of $8,500 is higher than what John is offering. I will accept Bob's offer and sell the product to him."
