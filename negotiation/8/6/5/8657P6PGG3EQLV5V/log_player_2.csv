"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Alice's offer is far too high.  It's time to negotiate."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000

Alice's offer is still too high for my budget. While $1,900,000 is lower than her original asking price, it's still outside my comfort zone.  I'll take the safe option and buy the product from John for $800,000."
