"Alice, while I appreciate the value of this product, $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000, which is a fair price considering my needs and the market value. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
