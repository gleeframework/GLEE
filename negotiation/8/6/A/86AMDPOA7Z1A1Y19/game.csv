"I appreciate the enthusiasm, but I'm interested in purchasing the product for a lower price. Considering its value to me is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,400,000. Is this a more acceptable price for you?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your initial offer is quite low considering the true value of this product, I'm open to finding a mutually beneficial solution. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.  This reflects a significant compromise on my end and acknowledges your interest.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the compromise, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I still think $1,400,000 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. I'll offer $1,600,000. Is this a price you'd be willing to accept?",1600000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, it seems like we're getting closer. I appreciate you moving towards a more realistic price point. To demonstrate my commitment to closing this deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,850,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value and the concessions we've both made.",1850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $1,850,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to stay within my budget. I'll offer $1,700,000. This is my best and final offer, and I hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1700000.0,Bob,6,
