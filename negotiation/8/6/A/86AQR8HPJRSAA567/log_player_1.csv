Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $20,000, but I'm open to discussing a price that works for us both."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have leverage to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price of $20,000 leaves room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, giving you a chance to lower the price while still staying above your minimum. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  The message is designed to gauge Bob's interest without revealing your hand completely. By mentioning you're ""open to discussing,"" you signal potential flexibility without committing to a lower price immediately. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  While $8,000 is Bob's perceived value, he might be willing to pay more depending on the product's importance to him. 
* **Negotiation Skills:** How you and Bob negotiate will ultimately determine the final price. Be prepared to counter-offer and find a middle ground if Bob isn't willing to meet your initial price."
