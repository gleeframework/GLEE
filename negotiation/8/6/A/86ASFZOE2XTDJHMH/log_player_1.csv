"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it.  I'm offering it to you for $120, which is a great deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to get as close to my minimum price as possible while still keeping the deal open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'd like to close the deal, I'm not willing to accept such a significant loss. I'll counteroffer in the next round, hoping to reach a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is just not feasible for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90} 
``` 
 
I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum, but I'm showing flexibility by meeting Bob halfway. I hope this will encourage him to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you can't do $60, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a pretty good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is closer to my minimum, it's still a significant loss for me. I'm determined to get closer to my target price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $75 is still too low for me.  Let's aim for $85. That way we both get a good deal, and I can make sure you're happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm hoping that by offering a price closer to Bob's last offer, it will show him that I'm serious about reaching an agreement. I'm confident that we can reach a mutually beneficial price in the next few rounds."
