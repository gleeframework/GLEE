"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob should reject the offer.  While $14,000 is lower than Alice's valuation, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay.  Bob has room to negotiate and should try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'd be willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I'll sell it to you for $13,250? That way, we both get a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $13,250 is closer to his maximum, it's still more than he'd like to pay. There's still room for negotiation, and he can potentially get a better price with a counteroffer.  He also has the option to buy from John, which is his best option if he can't get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,250 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000, but that's my absolute maximum.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $13,000 is still a little low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $13,500.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a good profit while you still get a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  While Alice has come down a bit, $13,500 is still more than Bob is willing to pay. At this point, John is offering a much better deal, and it's more advantageous for Bob to secure the product at a lower price rather than risk continuing to negotiate with Alice."
