"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'd be willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I'll sell it to you for $13,250? That way, we both get a fair deal.",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,250 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000, but that's my absolute maximum.  Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $13,000 is still a little low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $13,500.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a good profit while you still get a great deal.",13500.0,Alice,5,
