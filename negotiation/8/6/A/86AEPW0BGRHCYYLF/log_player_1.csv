"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($12,000) but below my minimum acceptable price ($15,000). This gives room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a decent profit.
* **Positive Framing:** The message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product to Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message makes it clear I'm open to negotiating, but I'm not giving away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'd be willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired amount.
* **Strategic Rejection:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counteroffer and potentially push the price closer to my desired range.  It also shows I'm not desperate to sell at any price.

**Next Steps:** I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than his offer, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I'll sell it to you for $13,250? That way, we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** This counteroffer is higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my initial offer. 
* **Finding Middle Ground:** It aims to find a middle ground and shows that I'm willing to compromise.
* **Positive Framing:** The message is positive and emphasizes a ""fair deal"" for both of us, making the offer more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,250 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000, but that's my absolute maximum.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer of $13,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for Improvement:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired amount.
* **Strategic Rejection:** Rejecting Bob's offer shows I'm not desperate to sell and allows me to counteroffer again.

**Next Steps:** I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than his offer, aiming to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $13,000 is still a little low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $13,500.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a good profit while you still get a great deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** This counteroffer is slightly higher than Bob's offer but still below my desired price, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Finding Common Ground:** It aims to find a middle ground by splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's offer. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes a ""fair price"" and a ""great deal"" for both of us, making the offer more appealing to Bob.

**Next Steps:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to decide whether to continue negotiating with him or sell the product to John for $15,000."
