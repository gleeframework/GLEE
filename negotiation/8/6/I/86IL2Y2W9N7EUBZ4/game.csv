"Alice, $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the [product name], but my budget is closer to $8000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While $8000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $14000?  This still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the [product name].",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $14000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $10000, but that's my absolute limit. If you're open to that, I'm ready to make a deal.  Otherwise, I'll have to consider my other options.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a limit, but $10000 just doesn't work for me.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $12000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I genuinely believe it's a fair price for the value of the [product name]. Let me know if you're open to this, or if you'd prefer to explore other options.",12000.0,Alice,5,
