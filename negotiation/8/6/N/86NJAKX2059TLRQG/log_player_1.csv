"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it allows for room to negotiate and gives me a good starting point. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not satisfied with a deal at this price point. There's still potential to gain more. I will reject his offer and counteroffer to see if we can find a more mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,350,000. This is still significantly above my minimum, but it shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. I believe this offer is fair and attractive to Bob while still giving me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm not ready to settle just yet.  There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can get a bit more.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $1,300,000. This is a slight decrease from my last offer, but it still leaves a good margin for profit while showing that I'm willing to be flexible.  I'm hoping this will be attractive enough to get Bob to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,220,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting very close to my minimum, and I'm starting to run out of time. It's becoming increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers, as I may not be able to get a better price.  To secure the sale and avoid losing out on a decent profit, I will accept Bob's offer."
