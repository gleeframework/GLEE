"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's too early to accept. You have 9 rounds to negotiate a better price with Alice.  There's a good chance you can get it for less than $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
``` 

This is a significant counteroffer, demonstrating your desire to negotiate while still leaving room for compromise. It's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to come down on her price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice is showing some flexibility by coming down to $900,000, but it's still too high. You have several rounds left to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

You're slowly closing the gap with Alice, but you're not willing to pay more than $800,000. This is a reasonable counteroffer, showing your commitment to buying the product while still pushing for a better price."
