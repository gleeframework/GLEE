"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above what I know the product is worth to me, but below John's offer.  This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a good price.  I'm also being friendly and open to discussion to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price and my value for the product. It's worth trying to negotiate further before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $140.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering a price that's still above my minimum but shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. The message also keeps the conversation friendly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I can only go up to $130. That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not at a comfortable price point. I'd prefer to see if I can get a little more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $130 still leaves me at a loss. How about we split the difference and meet at $135? It's a fair compromise, and it allows us to both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 135} 
``` 

I'm offering a price that's a compromise and shows I'm willing to be flexible. I'm also highlighting the benefit for both of us to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet at $132? That's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $132 is still below my initial goal, it's close to my minimum acceptable price and above my value for the product. With only four rounds left, it's better to secure a sale now than to risk a further drop in price or reaching a stalemate."
