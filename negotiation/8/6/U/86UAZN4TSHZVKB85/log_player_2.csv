Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate your offer and your willingness to compromise.  However,  $793,750 is still below my minimum.  To avoid further back-and-forth, I'm willing to accept $800,000, which is my final offer.  This price allows both of us to walk away with a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know what you decide. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

Alice has reached her minimum acceptable price.  It's unlikely she'll go any lower and continuing to negotiate risks her withdrawing the offer. This is a good deal compared to John's offer."
