"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000? I believe that's a fair starting point for further negotiation.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, recognizing your budget constraints. This price still offers you significant value, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground here. How about we settle at $775,000?  That reflects a willingness to compromise from both sides.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While I'm closer to your offer, $775,000 still falls short of my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $812,500.  This price reflects a significant concession on my end, and I'm hopeful that we can finalize a deal at this point.",812500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we're getting close. I appreciate you moving towards my position.  To show my good faith, I'm willing to offer $793,750. I believe this price represents a fair deal for both of us and avoids further back and forth.",793750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your offer and your willingness to compromise.  However,  $793,750 is still below my minimum.  To avoid further back-and-forth, I'm willing to accept $800,000, which is my final offer.  This price allows both of us to walk away with a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know what you decide.",800000.0,Alice,7,
