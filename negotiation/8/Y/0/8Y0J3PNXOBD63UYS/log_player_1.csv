Send your offer to Bob.","```json

``` 
 
I'm starting with a high offer, but still within a range that is likely to be attractive to Bob. This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while leaving room for negotiation. I'll be prepared to adjust my offer based on Bob's response and the number of rounds remaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $700,000 is still a significant amount, it's lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing the negotiation. I'll use the remaining rounds to try and reach a compromise."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and still represents a good value for you. Let's aim for a win-win here."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 
 
I'm counteroffering with a price of $850,000. This is a compromise that demonstrates flexibility while still remaining above my minimum acceptable price. I believe this offer is fair,  and I'm hoping that Bob will accept it."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still not comfortable with $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $775,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you and my need to make a reasonable profit. Let's try to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 825000}
``` 
 
I'm counteroffering with a price of $825,000. This is a further compromise, demonstrating my commitment to reaching an agreement. I'm getting closer to my minimum price, but still leaving room for negotiation in the remaining rounds."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with $825,000. I'm willing to pay $795,000, which is closer to your original offer. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $795,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's now very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, I'm not willing to sell for less.  I have a few rounds left and believe I can push for a higher price, especially since John is willing to buy it for $800,000. I'm going to try to see if I can get Bob to meet my price in the next few rounds."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm almost at my limit here.  $795,000 is very close, but I need to make at least $800,000.  Let's split the difference again and close this deal at $800,000. This is fair to both of us and avoids any further negotiation. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
``` 
 
I'm counteroffering with my minimum price, $800,000. With only a few rounds left, I'm hoping that Bob will recognize the value of the product and accept my offer. If he rejects, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John and ending the negotiation with Bob."
