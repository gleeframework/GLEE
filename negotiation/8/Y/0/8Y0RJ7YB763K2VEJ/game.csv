"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. This product looks promising, but that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $1,000,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something a little lower. How about $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I see you're trying to squeeze a bit more out of me, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here.",950000.0,Alice,5,
