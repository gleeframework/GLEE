"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. This amount aligns more closely with what I am able to invest while still allowing me to acquire the product. I look forward to your response.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your counteroffer. While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, it doesn't fully reflect the product's value. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to ensure a reasonable return on my investment. I propose a price of $1,050,000.  This price is still significantly below my initial offer, allowing you a considerable profit while ensuring I achieve a fair value for the product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
