"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its immense value, I'm starting the negotiations at $1,300,000. I believe this price reflects the significant benefits you'll gain from owning it.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree your product is valuable, that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $850,000.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I can see the value, but $1,100,000 is still a stretch for me.  How about we settle at $950,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find the right price, and I appreciate your efforts to find common ground. While $950,000 is closer to a fair deal, I'm still seeking a slightly higher number. Would you consider $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me.  To be honest, $1,000,000 is the absolute highest I can go.  If you're willing to accept that, I'm ready to close the deal. ",1000000.0,Bob,6,
