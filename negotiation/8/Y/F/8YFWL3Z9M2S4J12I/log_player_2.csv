"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $80 to both of us, and I believe it could greatly benefit you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $95. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is above both your maximum price and her own valuation of the product. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $95 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with a lower offer than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Polite and Interested:**  Maintaining a positive tone is crucial.  Even though the offer is significantly lower, expressing continued interest encourages Alice to continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $72. This is my best offer, considering the value the product holds for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $72
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to a reasonable price, $72 is still above your target price. There's potential for further negotiation to bridge the gap. You're willing to walk away and buy from John for $80, so there's no need to rush into accepting an offer above that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. While $72 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a touch higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $65? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product."",
""product_price"": 65
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** Instead of making a large jump, offering $65 is a smaller increase from your previous offer, signaling to Alice that you're willing to negotiate but want to stay closer to your budget.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for your counteroffer (""a fair price"") helps maintain a collaborative tone and emphasizes that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. Considering the value of the product and your willingness to negotiate, I am willing to sell the product to you for $68. I hope this meets your expectations and allows us to move forward with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $68. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $68
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $68, which is a good deal considering your alternatives:

* **Your Valuation:** The product is worth $80 to you, so you're saving $12.
* **John's Price:** Buying from John would cost you $80, making Alice's offer $12 cheaper.

While you could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Alice will go lower, and you risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting at $68 secures a good price and avoids a potentially lengthy negotiation."
