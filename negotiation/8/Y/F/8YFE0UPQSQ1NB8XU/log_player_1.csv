{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 
 
This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price that is slightly lower than the product's value to you, but still above Bob's perceived value. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, while still allowing you to potentially get a good price. 

This strategy balances your desire to maximize your profit with the risk of losing the deal to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $10,000 for it. Would you consider adjusting your price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's far below the product's worth to me. I'm willing to risk continuing the negotiation with Bob, hoping to get a better price.  I'll counteroffer, aiming for a compromise closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While $10,000 is a fair price for the product, it's a bit below what I'm hoping to get.  Would you be willing to consider $12,000?  This would allow me to make a fair profit, while still giving you a great deal on a valuable product.  Let's see if we can find a common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am still committed to finding a fair price for both of us. I would like to propose a price of $11,000 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,000 isn't my ideal price, it's significantly closer to my minimum threshold of $15,000.  At this point, I've already spent several rounds negotiating with Bob, and further back-and-forth might lead to a stalemate. Accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure a sale quickly and avoid the risk of losing the deal to John."
