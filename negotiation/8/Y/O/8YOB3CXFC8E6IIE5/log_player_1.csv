Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price.  I've done my research, and while I agree this product has value,  $850,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about $650,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we're getting close! I'm ready to make a deal happen, but $775,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we settle at $710,000? That's a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while working for my budget.
