"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and after careful consideration, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $500,000.  This is a fair offer considering the market value.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $500,000 is considerably below its true value.  This product offers significant returns and is priced competitively within the market.  How about we meet halfway at $850,000?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price.  I've done my research, and while I agree this product has value,  $850,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about $650,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a middle ground.  Considering the value this product brings, I propose $775,000.  This reflects a significant reduction on my part while still recognizing its worth.",775000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting close! I'm ready to make a deal happen, but $775,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we settle at $710,000? That's a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while working for my budget.",710000.0,Bob,6,
