"I understand you're excited about this product, and I appreciate you offering it to me. However, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $11,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  That's a good deal for both of us, as it's still a profit for you and within my price range.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're willing to go up to $10,500, and I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm not willing to give up too much profit. I'll meet you at $10,750, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",10750.0,Alice,5,
