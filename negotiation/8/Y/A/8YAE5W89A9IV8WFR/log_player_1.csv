Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,500,000:** This price is significantly higher than my minimum value of $1,000,000. 
* **Reasoning:** By offering a higher price, I'm maximizing my potential profit.  Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'm aiming for a price that's still attractive while leaving room for negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **Worst-case scenario:** If Bob rejects the offer, I'm still guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.

This approach balances my desire for a high sale price with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
