Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potential profit maximization.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value"" and ""fair reflection,"" Alice subtly anchors the price in Bob's mind while leaving room for discussion.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is not demanding, inviting Bob to share his perspective and potentially negotiate. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** The fact that John exists provides leverage but is not explicitly used in the initial offer. It's a card Alice can play later if needed.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Depending on Alice's risk tolerance and understanding of Bob's personality (e.g., is he easily offended by high prices?), she could adjust her initial offer."
