"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $11,000.  I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this price reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,000 is less than your maximum budget, you know you have a fallback option with John at $12,000. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price further to avoid losing the sale."
