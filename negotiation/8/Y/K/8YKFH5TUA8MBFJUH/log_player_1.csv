Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but  I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $90 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $70.  Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:

While Bob is moving closer to my acceptable range, it's unlikely he'll reach the $100 mark. It's more profitable to cut negotiations short and sell to John at my desired price."
