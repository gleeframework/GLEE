"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,750,000:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than the product's worth to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and open to discussion. 
* **10 rounds:** I'm aware of the limited rounds and want to start strong to maximize my chances of a good deal. 
* **John as an alternative:** I'm keeping John in mind as a safety net if negotiations with Bob don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am looking for a more reasonable price. I would like to propose $1400000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $1,400,000 is below my minimum threshold of $1,500,000. I cannot accept it.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation, given Bob acknowledges the product's value.
* **John is a backup:** I'm aware of John's offer, but I'm willing to take a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is still a good deal considering the product's worth. Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm making a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum threshold. This shows I'm flexible and willing to negotiate.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to emphasize that my price is fair.
* **""Middle Ground"" approach:** Using this phrase encourages Bob to see the offer as a compromise.
* **Remaining Rounds:** I still have 7 rounds left, so I can afford to be a bit more patient."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $1550000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is close:** $1,550,000 is very close to my minimum threshold of $1,500,000.
* **Limited rounds:** We're already in round 4, leaving only 6 rounds left. It's important to secure a deal before running out of time.
* **John's offer:** While John's offer is a guaranteed $1,500,000, there's a good chance I can get a slightly better price from Bob with this offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The risk of rejecting this offer and continuing to negotiate is that we might not reach an agreement in the remaining rounds, leaving me with John's offer as the only option. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and a profit slightly higher than John's."
