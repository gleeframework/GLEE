"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1500000. Can you meet me at this price?",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns. While $1500000 is my absolute minimum, I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This reflects the unique value of the product and its potential for your business. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1750000, but I'm still a bit short. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1500000. Can you meet me at this price?",1500000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1500000 doesn't quite cover the value of this product.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1625000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. What do you think?",1625000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1625000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $1562500. Can you consider this price?",1562500.0,Bob,6,
