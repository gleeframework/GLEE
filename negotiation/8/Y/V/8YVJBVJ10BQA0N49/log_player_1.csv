I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This is a bold move, but I believe it's important to establish a high starting point.  I'm confident in the value of my product and want to leave room for negotiation while still maximizing my potential profit. 

I'm prepared to negotiate further if Bob rejects my initial offer, but I will always have John as a backup buyer at $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to **reject** Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take the $1,000,000, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'm confident the product is worth more than that to Bob, especially since he's willing to buy it at all.  

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,200,000.  This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still well above Bob's opening bid.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us."
