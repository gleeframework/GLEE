"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $5,000. Let me know if that works for you.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $5,000 is too low, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This product offers significant value, and I'm confident you'll see a return on your investment.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. However,  $14,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Could you consider something closer to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we split the difference again and settle at $10,500? This is my final offer.",10500.0,Alice,5,
