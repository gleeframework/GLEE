Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,700,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but it gives me some room to negotiate. I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}

I'm going to counter with $1,550,000. This is still above Bob's value but significantly closer to my minimum. I'm hoping to find a middle ground in this round."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to counteroffer again in hopes of finding a price that works for both of us."

We're running out of rounds, and Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum, but still below it. It's getting risky to keep negotiating. I'm going to sell the product to John to guarantee my minimum value."
