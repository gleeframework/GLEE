"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a fantastic opportunity and I think you'll find it very valuable.  I'm asking $1,400,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value to encourage negotiation.
* **Leaving Room:**  $1,400,000 is a good starting point, allowing for potential concessions in later rounds. 
* **John as Leverage:** My knowledge of John's offer gives me a safety net, allowing me to be more aggressive in the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,400,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering the value we both see in it. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Low Offer:** Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Leverage:** I still have the option of selling to John for a higher price, so I'm not under pressure to accept Bob's low offer.
* **Negotiation:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which reflects both our needs.  This would give you a good deal, and still allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm making a counter-offer that's a significant step closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Compromise:** My message emphasizes that I'm willing to compromise, but still holding firm on my value.
* **Building Agreement:** The language focuses on finding a solution that works for both of us, making it more likely Bob will see the value in my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,350,000 is still a little high for me. I'm happy to meet in the middle at $1,300,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to stay within my budget and giving you a good deal on the product. Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still below what I'm hoping for.
* **Negotiation Continues:** I believe there's still room to negotiate a higher price, especially considering I have John's offer as a safety net. 
* **Seeking Better Deal:** I'm not in a rush to sell, and I want to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $1,300,000, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'm offering $1,325,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's close this and make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** I'm making a smaller concession this round, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still holding firm on my value.
* **Closing the Gap:** This counter-offer brings us closer to an agreement, demonstrating my commitment to finding a solution.
