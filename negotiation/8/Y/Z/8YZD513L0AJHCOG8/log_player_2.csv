"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a fantastic opportunity and I think you'll find it very valuable.  I'm asking $1,400,000 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  It's better to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,400,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering the value we both see in it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which reflects both our needs.  This would give you a good deal, and still allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's ideal price point. He's willing to go as high as $1,250,000, and there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue haggling and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,350,000 is still a little high for me. I'm happy to meet in the middle at $1,300,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to stay within my budget and giving you a good deal on the product. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $1,300,000, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'm offering $1,325,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's close this and make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,325,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  While there is a possibility of further negotiation,  Bob has already rejected two counteroffers and is in round 5.  The likelihood of getting a better deal with Alice is diminishing.  It's more beneficial for Bob to take the guaranteed deal with John at his maximum budget price."
