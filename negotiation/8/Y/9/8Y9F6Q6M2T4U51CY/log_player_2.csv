"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $900,000?"", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle at $975,000? It's a fair compromise that brings us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $975,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a price that reflects the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated this is her final offer. While the price of $1,025,000 is getting closer to our ideal price, it's still above our $1,000,000 limit.  Since we have the option to buy from John at $1,000,000, it makes more financial sense to do so and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
