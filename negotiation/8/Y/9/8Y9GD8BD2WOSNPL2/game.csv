"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is my final offer.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product has value, but $2,000,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000?  That's my final offer.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
