"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $900,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to be flexible.  I'm prepared to reduce my price to $1,200,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to make a good deal. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
