Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's in excellent condition and worth every penny.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to pay closer to his value.  It also leaves room for me to lower the price if needed, or accept a counteroffer that's closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay $8,000 for it. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,000 is my minimum, Bob's offer is still below my preferred price point. I'd like to see if I can push for something closer to my initial offer of $9,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  That's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I believe we can reach an agreement closer to my previous offer. I am willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is still within my budget and represents a fair compromise. I hope you'll consider this proposal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is only $500 less than my preferred price point of $9,000.  While I would have liked to get closer to my initial goal,  it's still a good deal considering that I can sell the product to John for $8,000.  It's better to accept the offer and secure the sale than to risk further negotiations and potentially lose out on a sale altogether."
