"I understand you have a lower budget in mind, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer you the product for $1100000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, but I believe the product's value is worth it.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm starting to think that $950000 is getting a bit too low for the product's value.

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $980000. I'll make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll offer you the product for $1020000. This is as close to my minimum as I'm willing to go.",1020000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm not willing to go any lower than $1020000, Bob. I think we're getting close to the product's true value. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll offer you the product for $1015000. This is the final price I'm willing to consider.",1015000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your last offer, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go above $1200000. I'll have to consider buying the product from another seller if we can't come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,10,
