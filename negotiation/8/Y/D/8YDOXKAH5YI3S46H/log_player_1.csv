"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, hoping to get a good price for my product. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not giving it away!  I'll see what Bob's reaction is and adjust my strategy for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $1,000,000 is too low for me. I'm confident I can get a better price, even if it takes a few more rounds of negotiation.  I'll see if I can push Bob closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm going to counter Bob with $1,300,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still a decent amount for me. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price and accept it. We'll see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I was hoping for a bit more, $1,200,000 is a good price and it's the minimum I was willing to accept. I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob by pushing for a higher price.  Plus, John is offering the same amount, so there's no need to continue negotiating."
