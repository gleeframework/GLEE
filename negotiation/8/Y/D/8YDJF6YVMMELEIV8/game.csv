"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you have a budget in mind. I can't go as low as $7500, but I'm willing to come down to $9000.  This still represents a fantastic value for you, and it's the best I can do at this time. Let's try to find a middle ground that works for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $9000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8500. Can you consider that price?",8500.0,Bob,4,
