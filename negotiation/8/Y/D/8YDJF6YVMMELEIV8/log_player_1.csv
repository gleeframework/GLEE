"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $10,000. It's a steal considering its value and potential. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price ($10,000) to maximize my potential profit. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm emphasizing the ""incredible value"" and ""potential"" of the product to encourage Bob to see its worth.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message leaves room for negotiation, indicating I'm open to finding a price that works for both of us. 
* **Safety Net:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed $8,000 from John gives me the flexibility to be bold in my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $7,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Potential for better negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is lower than desired, it shows his interest in the product. There's potential for a counteroffer that falls closer to my desired range.
* **More rounds to play:** We have 8 more rounds. I can afford to reject this offer and continue the negotiation process to try and secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you have a budget in mind. I can't go as low as $7,500, but I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This still represents a fantastic value for you, and it's the best I can do at this time. Let's try to find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reiterating the ""fantastic value"" of the product to persuade Bob.
* **Building Rapport:**  The message uses friendly language and emphasizes finding a mutually agreeable solution,  building rapport and encouraging continued negotiation. 
* **Keeping the Door Open:**  I'm not committing to this price as my final offer, keeping the possibility of further negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $9000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8500. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above minimum:** Bob's offer of $8,500 is above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* **Closing the deal:**  We're nearing the middle ground, and accepting this offer ensures a profitable sale. 
* **Limited rounds:**  With only 6 rounds remaining, it's risky to continue negotiating and potentially lose the deal altogether.  It's better to secure a reasonable profit now.
* **Potential counteroffers:**  While further negotiation might lead to a slightly higher price, it's also possible that Bob will lower his offer in subsequent rounds, jeopardizing my profit margin."
