I've decided to accept Bob's offer of $1,050,000. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a significant amount above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000 and is closer to my initial asking price than John's offer. It seems like further negotiation might not yield a better outcome, and I'd rather secure the deal with Bob now."
