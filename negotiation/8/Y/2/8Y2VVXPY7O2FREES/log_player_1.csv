"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $10,000, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. 

I'm keeping in mind that I have the option of selling to John for $10,000 at any time, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm happy with $10,000, I believe I can still do better. Bob's offer is way too low. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob with $12,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum value. I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not going to give it away for pennies."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting too low.  I'm not willing to accept $9,000, especially when I have a guaranteed buyer in John for $10,000.  I'm going to try to push Bob a little higher with my next counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $11,000. I'm feeling a bit more pressured now, as we're getting close to my minimum value and John is always a tempting option. But I believe I can still squeeze a bit more out of Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting too low.  I'm not willing to risk going any lower.  It's time to take the guaranteed $10,000 from John and avoid further potential losses."
