Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $1,000,000 to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $750,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than what I know the product is worth to him, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000, which still represents a significant value for you. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000.  While Bob's offer of $800,000 is tempting, it's not worth risking further negotiation. I've already received a guaranteed offer from John for the same price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal with John and getting nothing at all if I keep negotiating with Bob."
