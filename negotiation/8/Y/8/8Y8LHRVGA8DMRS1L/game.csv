"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000, which still represents a significant value for you. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,
