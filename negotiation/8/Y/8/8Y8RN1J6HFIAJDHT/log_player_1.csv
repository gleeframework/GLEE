{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's above Bob's perceived value of $120, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's also below my minimum acceptable price of $150, giving me some wiggle room if Bob counter-offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  That product looks great, but $135 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I could accept it and get something, I'd be leaving a lot of money on the table. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $110 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $122.50? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 122.50}
```"
