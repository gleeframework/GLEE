"I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum. However, I'm willing to be flexible. I'm going to propose a price of $950,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on. Let's make this deal happen!",950000.0,Alice,3,
