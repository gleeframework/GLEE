Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $120 is well above your minimum of $80, so you're already making a decent profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $150, so there's room for you to negotiate up from $120 if he's willing to pay more.
* **It's a strong opening offer:** $120 is a good price to start the negotiation. It's not too high, so Bob is likely to consider it, but it's also not too low, so you don't undervalue the product right away.

Keep in mind that this is just a starting point. You can adjust your strategy based on Bob's response. If he rejects your offer, you'll need to figure out how to move forward. You can lower your price slightly, try to understand why he's rejecting the offer, or simply sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $100. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is better than selling to John for $80, it's still below your ideal target. You've already demonstrated your willingness to negotiate, and Bob's offer is quite close to your minimum acceptable price.  By rejecting his offer, you maintain leverage and signal that you're not willing to settle for a price that doesn't reflect the product's value.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, you'll need to decide on a counteroffer. Consider the following:

* **How much do you want to lower your price?:** A small decrease, perhaps to $110, could signal your willingness to compromise while still keeping the deal favorable.
* **How much does Bob value the product?:** Remember, he believes it's worth $150.
* **Are you willing to risk selling to John?:** If you're really looking for a better price, be prepared to walk away if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is still a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows you're willing to meet Bob halfway. You've decreased your price from $120 to $110, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain Value:**  $110 is still significantly above your minimum of $80 and closer to your initial target of $120. 
* **Open Communication:**  The message emphasizes your understanding of Bob's perspective and expresses a desire to reach an agreement.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's Response:**  If he accepts, you've secured a good deal. If he rejects, you'll need to decide whether to make another counteroffer or sell to John.
* **Consider Your Options:** If you do make another counteroffer, consider lowering your price further or offering a different deal structure (e.g., a payment plan)."
