"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $170. I think it's a great deal for its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Alice's offer is way too high, and you should immediately reject it.  There's no point in negotiating with her at this point since you can get the product from John for a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $170 is way above my budget. I'm only willing to pay $80 for this product. Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 80}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints but $80 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above your budget. You can get the product for a lower price from John, so there's no reason to accept. You should continue negotiating with Alice, hoping to get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $130 is still too high. I'm willing to go up to $100. It's a fair price, considering I can get the same product from John for less. Let me know if you're open to this."", ""product_price"": 100}
