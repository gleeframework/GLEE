"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $18,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Alice's starting offer is far too high. It's important to bring the price down significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering!  While I do like the product, $18,000 is quite a bit more than I had in mind. Would you consider a price closer to $5,000?"", ""product_price"": 5000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting with a much lower offer ($5,000), I'm trying to establish a bargaining position that's significantly below Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is polite and expresses interest in the product. However, it clearly states that the initial price is unacceptable.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counter-offer will gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. If she completely rejects this offer, it might indicate that reaching a deal within my budget will be difficult."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I'm motivated to sell, $5,000 is significantly below its value. Could you consider something closer to $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice came down from her initial offer, $14,000 is still significantly higher than my target price and what I'm willing to pay. It's time to counter again and see if we can meet somewhere closer to the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, $14,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to meet in the middle somewhere around $7,000?"", ""product_price"": 7000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Towards the Middle Ground:** I've increased my offer significantly to show Alice I'm serious about negotiating, but I'm still aiming for a price that works for me.
* **Testing the Water (Again):**  This counter-offer will give me a better understanding of Alice's flexibility. If she's unwilling to go below $10,000, it might be time to consider John's offer seriously. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I've left some room for further negotiation in case Alice is completely unwilling to go as low as $7,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we settle at $10,000? This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While $10,000 is a much better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still $2,000 more than I can get the product for from John. 
* **One Last Push:** I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can get Alice closer to $8,000. If she refuses, I'll go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, you've come down a lot, and I appreciate that.  To be honest, my absolute maximum budget for this is $8,000. I understand that might not be ideal for you, but it's the most I can offer.  If you're willing to work with that, I'm ready to make the deal."", ""product_price"": 8000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I've been clear that this is my absolute maximum price. This removes any ambiguity and lets Alice know I'm serious.
* **Explaining the Situation:** By briefly mentioning my budget limitations, I'm hoping to appeal to Alice's understanding and potentially get her to agree. 
* **Ready to Walk Away:** I'm prepared to buy from John if Alice rejects this offer. It's important to be willing to walk away from a negotiation if the terms aren't meeting my needs."
