"Hi Alice, thanks for offering!  While I do like the product, $18,000 is quite a bit more than I had in mind. Would you consider a price closer to $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I'm motivated to sell, $5,000 is significantly below its value. Could you consider something closer to $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, $14,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to meet in the middle somewhere around $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we settle at $10,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, you've come down a lot, and I appreciate that.  To be honest, my absolute maximum budget for this is $8,000. I understand that might not be ideal for you, but it's the most I can offer.  If you're willing to work with that, I'm ready to make the deal.",8000.0,Bob,6,
