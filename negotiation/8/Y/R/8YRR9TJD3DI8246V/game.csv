,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100, which is still a good deal for both of us.  What do you say?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $100 is still a little high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $95.  Let's split the difference and make this deal work.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  But $95 is still too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $97.50?  That's a fair price for both of us.",97.5,Alice,5,
