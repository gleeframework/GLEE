{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it is:

* **Higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob an incentive to negotiate.
* **Lower than your minimum acceptable price:** This allows for some wiggle room during negotiation. 

By offering $110, you are trying to maximize your profit while also leaving room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I will reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100, which is still a good deal for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $100 is still a little high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $95.  Let's split the difference and make this deal work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $95 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired profit margin. I will reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  But $95 is still too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $97.50?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 97.5}
