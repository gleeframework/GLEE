Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I'm willing to sell for $15,000 to John, so anything above that is profit.
* **Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $8,000, so I need to offer him a price he'll find appealing but still profitable for me.
* **Negotiation:**  $12,000 is a fair compromise. It's a good deal for Bob, allowing him to make a profit, and it gives me a significant return. 
* **Risk:** If Bob rejects the offer, I have a guaranteed sale to John, so there's minimal risk."
