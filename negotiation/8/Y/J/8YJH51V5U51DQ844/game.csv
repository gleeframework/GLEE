"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,100,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering my needs.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000, which is a significant jump from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and my budget. What do you think?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $975,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and your budget.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
