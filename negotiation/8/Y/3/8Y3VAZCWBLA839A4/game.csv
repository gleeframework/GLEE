"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1100000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1150000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business. Let me know if this is more in line with your budget.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1080000. I can meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1120000. This is a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable, considering the product's value and benefits.",1120000.0,Alice,5,
