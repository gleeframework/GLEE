Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you could offer it at $150 and guarantee a sale to John, there's a chance Bob will pay a bit more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it slightly below your guaranteed sale price ($149 instead of $150) creates a sense of urgency and a feeling of getting a deal for Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this example doesn't involve back-and-forth negotiation, starting a bit higher leaves you room to potentially lower the price slightly if Bob hesitates, without going below your minimum."
