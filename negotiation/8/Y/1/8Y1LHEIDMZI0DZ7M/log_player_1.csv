Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $100. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it would be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You are aware that the product is worth $120 to Bob, providing you leverage in the negotiation.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $100 allows you to capture a significant portion of the value difference (Bob's $120 valuation - your $80 minimum).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is closer to Bob's maximum, it leaves some room for potential counter-offers, increasing the likelihood of a successful sale.
* **Backup Option:** You have a guaranteed sale at $80 with John, ensuring you won't be left with a loss if Bob rejects the offer.

This strategy balances profit maximization with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
