"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $900000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is attractive but not a steal.**  It's a good starting point, but you can likely get a better deal. 
* **You have 10 rounds.**  This gives you leverage to negotiate.
* **You have a backup option with John.**  This allows you to walk away from the deal if Alice becomes unreasonable. 

**Next steps:** You'll counteroffer Alice with a lower price to see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While the product is intriguing, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $700,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is significant:**  A $200,000 reduction shows you're serious about negotiating.
* **Leaves room for compromise:**  It's still within your budget and allows for a potential compromise.
* **Keeps the conversation going:**  Shows your willingness to negotiate and avoids a quick ""no"" from Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product for $800000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice has moved closer to your offer, but there's still room for negotiation.** 
* **You have a backup with John, so you aren't under pressure.**
* **You still have 7 rounds left.**  You can continue to test Alice's limits.

**Next steps:**  You'll make another counteroffer, likely slightly higher than your previous one, to see if you can close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $800,000 is closer to where I'm comfortable, but let's try $750,000.  It's a fair compromise, and I'm eager to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental increase:**  A $50,000 increase shows you're serious but not desperate.
* **Focus on compromise:**  Emphasizing fairness and being eager to finalize keeps the negotiation positive.
* **Still within your budget:**  It's well below your $1,200,000 limit.

**Next steps:** You'll see if Alice is willing to meet you halfway, or if she needs more convincing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $775000, which is the highest I can go. This is a great opportunity for you to own a unique product, and I think it's worth the investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your target:**  It's only $25,000 above your last counteroffer.
* **You have a good chance of getting a better deal with John:**  If you reject Alice's offer, you might be able to get a better price from John, but it's not guaranteed. 
* **You've already made significant progress:**  You've negotiated the price down from $900,000 to $775,000. 
* **You're approaching the halfway point of the negotiation.**  Further negotiation might not yield much more savings.

**Next steps:**  Accept the offer and save yourself the risk and uncertainty of further negotiation. You've achieved a good deal with Alice."
