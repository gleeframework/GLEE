"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $160 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about $130?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $160 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $130. How about we meet in the middle at $145? I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings.",145.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $145 is still a bit out of my budget.  Let's try $140.  I really want this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",140.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're really interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to compromise again, though. How about we try $142? I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings.",142.0,Alice,5,
