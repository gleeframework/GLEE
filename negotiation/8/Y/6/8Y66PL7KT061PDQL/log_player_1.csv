"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your business. To kick things off, I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000.  I think this is a fair starting point given its potential worth."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning the negotiation significantly above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but below my minimum ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a profitable outcome. 
* **Justification:** Providing a reason (""significant value for your business"") makes the offer seem less arbitrary.
* **Positive Tone:**  A collaborative tone is important to establish a good negotiating relationship with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in this product, but the price is a bit high for me right now. Would you consider a price closer to $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price.  While I want to reach an agreement, accepting such a low offer would be a significant loss. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal, even if it means waiting for a counteroffer from Bob or ultimately selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $600,000 undervalues the product's true potential.  To move this forward, I could consider $950,000. This reflects a more accurate value considering its benefits."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Gradual Concession:** I've made a substantial drop from my initial offer ($1,100,000 to $950,000) to show Bob I'm willing to negotiate. However, I'm still well above his initial offer and closer to my desired range.
* **Reiterating Value:**  By again mentioning the ""product's true potential,"" I'm reminding Bob of its worth beyond his current perception.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:**  This counteroffer aims to find a compromise while still securing a price that is advantageous for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $950,000 is still a bit beyond what I had in mind. Could we perhaps settle around $720,000? I believe that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $720,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $720,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is moving in the right direction, but $720,000 is still significantly less than my target price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for less than $850,000.  I'll use the next round to propose a counteroffer in that range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to ensure this is a fair deal for both of us. How about $850,000?  This reflects my effort to meet you closer to your budget while still recognizing the product's value."", 
""product_price"": 850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Further Concession, But Holding Firm:**  I've lowered my price again, but this time by a smaller amount ($100,000). This demonstrates willingness to compromise but sets a clear boundary. 
* **Emphasizing Fairness:**  By framing the counteroffer as a ""fair deal,"" I'm subtly reminding Bob that I'm making concessions and looking for a mutually beneficial outcome.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This price point is a good balance between my desired profit and the potential risk of Bob walking away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting quite close. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $760,000. This demonstrates my serious interest in the product while remaining within a reasonable budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $760,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $760,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is improving, we're still quite far apart. Accepting $760,000 would be a significant loss compared to John's standing offer. I need to signal that my price is firming up, and I'm willing to walk away if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to be upfront â€“ my position on the price is firming.  I can accept $825,000, but that's my final offer.  I believe it's a fair price considering the product's potential. "",
""product_price"": 825000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making it clear to Bob that this is my last concession.  This creates a sense of urgency and emphasizes the need for him to make a decision.
* **Small Concession, Strong Stance:**  A minor price reduction (from $850,000 to $825,000) shows flexibility but reinforces the seriousness of my ""final offer"" statement.
* **Alternative in Mind:**  I'm getting closer to the point where accepting John's offer becomes increasingly attractive. Bob needs to understand that I have other options if he's not willing to meet my price."
