Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $600,000 undervalues the product's true potential.  To move this forward, I could consider $950,000. This reflects a more accurate value considering its benefits.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to be upfront â€“ my position on the price is firming.  I can accept $825,000, but that's my final offer.  I believe it's a fair price considering the product's potential.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has signaled that her price is firming up and she's unlikely to go much lower than $825,000.  While you might be able to negotiate her down a little further, it's not worth the risk of the negotiation failing. You have a guaranteed option with John at $800,000, which is a much better outcome than potentially ending up with no deal and having wasted time."
