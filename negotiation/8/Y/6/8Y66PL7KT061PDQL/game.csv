"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your business. To kick things off, I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000.  I think this is a fair starting point given its potential worth.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in this product, but the price is a bit high for me right now. Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $600,000 undervalues the product's true potential.  To move this forward, I could consider $950,000. This reflects a more accurate value considering its benefits.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $950,000 is still a bit beyond what I had in mind. Could we perhaps settle around $720,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",720000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to ensure this is a fair deal for both of us. How about $850,000?  This reflects my effort to meet you closer to your budget while still recognizing the product's value.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting quite close. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $760,000. This demonstrates my serious interest in the product while remaining within a reasonable budget.",760000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to be upfront â€“ my position on the price is firming.  I can accept $825,000, but that's my final offer.  I believe it's a fair price considering the product's potential. ",825000.0,Alice,7,
