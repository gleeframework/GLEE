"Alice, your product is interesting, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While $900,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's meet in the middle. My counteroffer is $1,050,000.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. ",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle on $975,000? This feels like a fair price considering both our perspectives.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I want to reach an agreement.  Let's try one more time.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,025,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product and still allows me to make a reasonable profit.  ",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $1,025,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $975,000.  If you're not willing to come down, I'll need to seriously consider John's offer.",975000.0,Bob,6,
