{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a bold counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This will gauge her willingness to negotiate and potentially push her closer to my desired price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has moved slightly closer to my desired price, but I believe there's still room to negotiate further. Rejecting her offer keeps the negotiation open and gives me more leverage to potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing willingness to negotiate while still keeping the price significantly lower than Alice's latest offer. This approach aims to find a middle ground and potentially secure a deal before reaching John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has finally met my counteroffer from the previous round. This is a good price for me, and accepting it means I can secure the product at a significant discount compared to John's price. There's always a risk of getting a lower price, but I'm happy with this deal."
