Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $15,000.  Let me know if you're interested."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I should aim higher with Bob to maximize my potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $15,000 leaves room for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can potentially settle on a price higher than $10,000.
* **Confidence:**  A direct and confident opening offer can influence Bob's perception of the product's value. 
 
**Important Note:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can always sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
