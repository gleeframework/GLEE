"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price allows us both to make a good deal. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:**  Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is lower than John's price of $1,200,000. 
* **You still get a good deal:** While you could potentially negotiate further with Alice, accepting her offer saves you $100,000 compared to John."
