"Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you this unique product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone with your interests, and I wouldn't offer it to just anyone. Given its potential, I'm starting the conversation at $1,500,000.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the value you see in this product,  $1,500,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its potential. ",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  It's clear we both see the value in this product.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,100,000 is a significant gap from what I believe it's worth.  Could you consider $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value this product highly. However, $1,350,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, recognizing its potential, but that's my absolute limit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
