"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you this unique product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone with your interests, and I wouldn't offer it to just anyone. Given its potential, I'm starting the conversation at $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my budget. I need to negotiate a lower price.  It's too risky to accept her offer, and John's offer provides a safe alternative if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the value you see in this product,  $1,500,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its potential. "", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  It's clear we both see the value in this product.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,100,000 is a significant gap from what I believe it's worth.  Could you consider $1,350,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay.  I'm comfortable continuing the negotiations and exploring a lower price. Buying from John is a safety net, but I want to see if I can achieve a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you value this product highly. However, $1,350,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, recognizing its potential, but that's my absolute limit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
