""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $200. I believe it's a great deal considering its value."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your valuation of the product, but I'm hoping to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling the product for $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, I have a guaranteed offer from John for $150, which matches Bob's offer. Since my goal is to maximize profit and there's no guarantee of a better outcome with further negotiation with Bob, it makes the most sense to sell to John now."
