"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. How about we meet in the middle at $135? It's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",135.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $135 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Would you consider $130? It's closer to the middle ground we were looking for, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",130.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go below $135. However, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to meet you halfway. How about we settle at $132.50? It's a small concession, but I think it's a fair compromise.",132.5,Alice,5,
