"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I know you'll find valuable.  Given its unique benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a premium price. 
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and my openness to discussion, fostering a collaborative tone.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's willingness:**  His response will reveal how eager he is and how he perceives the product's value to him.
2. **Establish a strong position:** Starting high gives me leverage in subsequent negotiations. 
3. **Leave room for concessions:**  I can gradually lower the price in later rounds, creating a sense of progress and deal momentum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,300,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,800,000 is a good offer, I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob. I started high to leave room for negotiation, and I'm not willing to settle just yet. 

By rejecting Bob's offer and providing a counteroffer in the next round, I can try to meet somewhere in the middle while still aiming for a price closer to $2,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While $1,800,000 is tempting, I'm confident this product will bring you even more value. How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counteroffer aims for a compromise, showing Bob that I am willing to negotiate.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  The $2,000,000 price point is still a significant profit margin and closer to my initial ask,  signaling  that I value the product highly.
* **Clear and Concise Communication:**  The message is straightforward and reinforces the value proposition of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your confidence in the product's value, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,900,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has steadily increased his offer, and $1,900,000 is a very strong price.  While I'd prefer to hit $2,000,000, accepting now secures a substantial profit and avoids the risk of pushing Bob too far.  It's better to close the deal now at a favorable price than to risk losing the sale altogether."
