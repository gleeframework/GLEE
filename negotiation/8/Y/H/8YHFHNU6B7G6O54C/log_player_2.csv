"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think it would be a great fit for you! I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is a reasonable price, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Since he's willing to pay up to $120, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $105? "", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that's still above Alice's minimum price of $100, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. This initial counteroffer is also within Bob's budget, giving him some room to potentially go even lower if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! $105 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, and $110 is still within Bob's budget.  While there's always the possibility of trying to negotiate further, the risk of going another round increases the chance Alice will stick to her $110 offer or even increase it.  It's a good deal for both parties, and accepting helps avoid the risk of the deal falling through."
