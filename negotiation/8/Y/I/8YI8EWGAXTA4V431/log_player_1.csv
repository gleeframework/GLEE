"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  I'm asking for $13,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $8,000. Would you be able to accommodate this budget? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob is offering a price significantly lower than my minimum. While I want to maximize profit, holding out for a much higher price might push him away. Selling to John guarantees my minimum but leaves potential profit on the table. I'll negotiate a bit more.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below the value of this product. I could let it go for $11,500, which is a considerable compromise on my end. This offer stands as a testament to my desire to see this product in your capable hands."", ""product_price"": 11500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not able to meet you halfway at $11,500. My maximum budget remains at $8,000. I hope we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob seems firmly rooted at $8,000. It's unlikely I'll be able to bridge the gap to my desired price. It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed profit.
