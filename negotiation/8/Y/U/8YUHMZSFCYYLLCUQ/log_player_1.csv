Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to offer $10,000 for it. This is the maximum I am willing to pay.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I want to sell the product, I'm not willing to go below my minimum price of $12,000. I have the option of selling to John for that price, so I'll see if I can get closer to that with Bob in the next round."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached the final round of negotiations with Bob, and his offer of $11,050 is still below my minimum price of $12,000. I'm not willing to go any lower, and I've already exhausted all my negotiating options. Therefore, I will choose to sell the product to John for $12,000, as he has consistently offered a price that meets my minimum requirement."
