"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to offer $10,000 for it. This is the maximum I am willing to pay.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $11,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's keep the negotiation going, I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. Based on my budget constraints, I am able to offer $10,800 for the product. I hope this proposal works for you.",10800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. However, $10,800 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $11,400. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping you'll agree. ",11400.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, I am unable to meet you at $11,400. I am willing to offer $10,900 for the product. I hope this proposal works for you.",10900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting the feeling we might be a bit too far apart on price. I'm willing to make one final concession and offer the product for $11,200. This is a fair price considering its value and my own expenses. If you're not willing to go higher than $10,900, then unfortunately, we won't be able to make a deal. ",11200.0,Alice,7,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your final offer. I am willing to meet you halfway between our last two proposals. Therefore, I would like to offer $11,100 for the product. I hope this proposal works for you.",11100.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $11,100. However, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to offer the product for $11,150. This is a small increase from your last offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. If you're not willing to go any higher, I will unfortunately have to accept John's offer instead.",11150.0,Alice,9,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I am unable to meet you at $11,150. Considering my budget constraints, I am willing to offer $11,050 for the product. I hope this proposal works for you.",11050.0,Bob,10,
