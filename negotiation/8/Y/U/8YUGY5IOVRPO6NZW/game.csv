"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with an offer that I think is fair and reasonable. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get an amazing deal. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable,  $900,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $700,000.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the middle ground. How about we meet at $820,000? This is still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. What do you think?",820000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the extras Alice, and coming closer to a middle ground. To be completely transparent,  $800,000 is the highest I can go. If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $800,000 is your maximum, Bob. I appreciate your honesty. However, I still need to make a profit, and $800,000 is a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we meet at $850,000? This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
