"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with an offer that I think is fair and reasonable. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get an amazing deal. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the middle ground. How about we meet at $820,000? This is still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. What do you think?

# Alice's message: I understand that $800,000 is your maximum, Bob. I appreciate your honesty. However, I still need to make a profit, and $800,000 is a bit below my minimum.

Alice is not budging from a price that exceeds your limit. It's time to exercise your option to buy from John at $800,000."
