Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $13,500 is a good starting point. It's a significant amount for you, but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the value to Bob, increasing his incentive to accept. 
* **Flexibility:**  The offer leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, allowing for a potential win-win scenario. 
* **Plan B:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $10,000 provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $13,500 is a bit steep for me. Could you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $11,000 is better than John's offer, it's still significantly below the value to Bob ($15,000). 
* **Potential for a better deal:** There's still room for negotiation. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter and try to get closer to my desired price.
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting the offer, I maintain leverage and signal that I'm not desperate to sell at a low price. 

**Next Steps:**  I will counter Bob's offer with a price that is closer to $13,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference at $12,250? This still gives you a great deal, and it's fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  This approach shows a willingness to compromise and makes the offer seem reasonable.
* **Maintaining Value:** $12,250 is still significantly more than John's offer, ensuring a profit. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message again emphasizes the value to Bob, encouraging him to accept. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The offer still allows for further negotiation if Bob is hesitant."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice.  How about we settle at $11,750? It's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Goal:** $11,750 is only slightly lower than my initial offer of $13,500. This represents a good outcome considering the negotiation process.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  If I reject this offer, there's a chance that Bob will walk away or make a lower counteroffer. 
* **Minimizing Loss:**  While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting this offer ensures a decent profit compared to selling to John. 
* **Time Factor:**  The negotiation has been going on for a few rounds, and it's in my best interest to close the deal and avoid further delays."
