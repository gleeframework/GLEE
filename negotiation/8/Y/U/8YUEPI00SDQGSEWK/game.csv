"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I recognize the value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit high for me at this time. I'm willing to offer $900,000, which reflects a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit below my minimum.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This price still provides a good return for me while remaining fair for you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price that considers your needs and my budget. Let's work towards a deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is closer, I'm still not able to go that low.  Let's try $1,000,000. This price is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your efforts, but $1,000,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This is a fair compromise that's closer to our desired prices.  Let's aim for a final agreement.",975000.0,Bob,6,
