Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its worth and the benefit you'll gain from it."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and maximizes potential profit.
* **Justification:**  Highlighting the product's ""immense value"" and the ""benefit"" for Bob helps justify the high asking price. 
* **Leaving Room:**  The initial price of $1,800,000 is significantly higher than your minimum, allowing Bob to feel like he's getting a deal if he negotiates you down, even if it's still above $1,200,000.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob based on his response and willingness to pay."
