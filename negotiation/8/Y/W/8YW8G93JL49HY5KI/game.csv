"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $8000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10500. This is a great compromise that still reflects the product's value, but also takes into account your budget. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
