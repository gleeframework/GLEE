You can do better than $110. It's worth rejecting Alice's offer and trying to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer! I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $107.50? It's a fair price considering the value the product brings.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107.5

You're getting a good price at $107.50, considering John is asking for $120. It's worth accepting Alice's offer."
