Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and is worth a significant investment. I'm initially offering it to you for $2,000,000."", ""product_price"": 2000000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This allows room for negotiation and gives the impression the product is highly valued.
* **Above Bob's Value:** While I know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, starting significantly above this might make him reconsider his own valuation. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** This high price leaves ample room for me to lower the price during negotiation, potentially still reaching a price significantly above John's offer.

**Important Note:**  I'm aware I can always sell to John for $1,500,000. This offer is strategically designed to explore the possibility of a much higher profit with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe the product's value doesn't justify such a high price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Matching John's Offer:** Bob's offer matches what John is willing to pay. While it's tempting to accept and secure the sale, there's still potential to negotiate a higher price with Bob. 
* **Testing the Waters:** Rejecting this offer will help me gauge Bob's willingness to move closer to my desired price range. It signals that I believe the product is worth more than his initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, this product offers unique value that I'm confident justifies a higher investment.  How about we meet halfway and settle on $1,750,000?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Signaling Flexibility:** By lowering my price significantly, I'm showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate and find common ground. 
* **Still Above Bob's Valuation:**  The new price is still substantially above Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000, leaving room for him to potentially increase his offer.
* **Advantageous Position:** I'm strategically positioning myself above John's offer, ensuring that even if Bob counteroffers, I'm likely to secure a profit higher than my fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've given your proposal careful consideration. While I understand your position, I still feel that the product's value aligns more closely with a price closer to my initial offer. My counteroffer is $1,600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Profit:** Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a significant profit above my guaranteed sale price to John ($1,500,000).
* **Diminishing Returns:** While I could potentially squeeze out a bit more from Bob, there's a risk he'll walk away. The difference in potential profit versus the risk of losing the sale to Bob isn't worth it at this point.
* **Securing the Deal:** Accepting this offer guarantees a successful sale and a healthy profit. It's always preferable to secure a good deal rather than risk losing it for a marginally better one."
