Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000), but still leaves me with a profit. 

This offer is designed to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:** A lower price makes him more likely to consider the offer.
* **Start a negotiation:** This allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to negotiate and potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **Maintain the option to sell to John:**  If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for my minimum price.

I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. Accepting would result in a substantial loss. I'm not in a rush to sell and have a guaranteed backup buyer (John) who's willing to pay my desired price. Therefore, rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially achieve a better outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm raising the price slightly from my initial offer to $950,000. This move is meant to:

* **Signal my willingness to compromise:** While still well above Bob's offer, it shows I'm open to negotiation.
* **Test the waters:**  This counteroffer allows me to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway.
* **Maintain leverage:** If Bob rejects again, I can still go back to my initial $1,000,000 offer or even raise it slightly, knowing that John is a reliable backup. 

I'm aiming for a middle ground that balances my need for profit and the possibility of a successful deal with Bob."
