{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm offering the product at $115. This is a fair price that is still above my minimum value and leaves room for potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum value, I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? I'm confident this product is worth it to you."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I'm comfortable with $110. I'd be willing to go up to $108, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum, Bob's offer of $108 is still too low. I'm not willing to go any lower and risk not getting my minimum. Selling to John for $120 is the best option at this point."
