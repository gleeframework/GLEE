"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend. How about $140? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $140 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $155? It's still a good deal for you, and I can definitely make it work on my end.",155.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $155 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $150.  I'm ready to buy it at that price.",150.0,Bob,4,
