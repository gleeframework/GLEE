``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's a good middle ground:**  It's higher than your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 but lower than Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000. 
* **It shows you're willing to negotiate:**  It's not a take-it-or-leave-it offer.
* **It frames the deal positively:**  The message highlights the value for Bob."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While $1,250,000 is still above my minimum, I'm not willing to settle yet. There's room for Bob to come up a bit. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
