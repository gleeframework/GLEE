"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is much higher. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product,  $900,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $850,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $875,000. This is a very competitive offer, and I think you'll find it's a great value. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
