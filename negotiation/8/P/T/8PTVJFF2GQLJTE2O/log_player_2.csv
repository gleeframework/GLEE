"Round 1

You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not worth it to buy from Alice at her initial price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This gives me some room to negotiate upwards if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my limit, I'm still not willing to pay that much.  I'll keep negotiating and see if I can get her down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

I'm going to counter with my maximum price. If Alice accepts, great! If she rejects, I'll just buy from John."
