Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product for $900,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $800,000 to me, so I can't accept Bob's offer of $700,000. I will try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $700,000 and $850,000, so I'm offering $775,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $775,000 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still holding out for a better deal. I'll see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $775,000 is still below my minimum.  Let's split the difference again. I'm willing to come down to $812,500. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 812500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $812,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $800,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by rejecting it and potentially having him walk away.  While I would prefer to get more,  $800,000 is a good price considering the time we have left in the negotiation."
