Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $2,300,000 is significantly higher than I'm able to pay at this time. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product. This is a serious offer, and I'm confident it reflects the fair market value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand you believe the product is worth more, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,900,000.  I'm willing to go up to $1,600,000, which is a significant amount for me and a fair reflection of the product's value. Let's see if we can finalize a deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.
