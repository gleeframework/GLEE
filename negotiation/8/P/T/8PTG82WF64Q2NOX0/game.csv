"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your expertise. To kick things off, I propose a starting price of $2,300,000. I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $2,300,000 is significantly higher than I'm able to pay at this time. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product. This is a serious offer, and I'm confident it reflects the fair market value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand you believe the product is worth more, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,900,000.  I'm willing to go up to $1,600,000, which is a significant amount for me and a fair reflection of the product's value. Let's see if we can finalize a deal at this price.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
