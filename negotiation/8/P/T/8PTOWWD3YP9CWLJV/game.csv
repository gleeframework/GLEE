"Bob, I'm confident this product is a game-changer for you, and I'm eager to make this happen. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. This price reflects the value you'll gain, while also allowing me a healthy return on my investment. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? I think that's a fair price that benefits both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm open to a compromise.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,100,000.  This gives you a great deal, while still ensuring I get a fair return. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we settle at $1,050,000? That's a reasonable compromise, wouldn't you say?",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the value this product will bring to your business, I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000.  It's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  To be honest,  $1,075,000 is pushing my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,060,000 as my final offer.  It's a win-win for both of us. Let me know what you think.",1060000.0,Bob,6,
