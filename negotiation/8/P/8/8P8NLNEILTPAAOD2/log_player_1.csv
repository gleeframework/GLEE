"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,200,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get more than the product's value to me.  I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price with Bob, as he values the product at $1,000,000, but I also have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is still a decent amount, I'm not willing to sell for that low yet.  I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $1,100,000. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, showing flexibility, but still higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be a good compromise and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to what I want, I'm going to keep negotiating to see if I can get a better price. I'll reject his offer and counter again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $1,050,000. This is a compromise, but it still gives me a profit.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value of the product and agree to this price. If not, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my ideal price, I'm still not happy with it. I want to try to get closer to $1,000,000, which is what I could get from John. I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1020000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $1,020,000. This is a small step down from my previous offer, but I'm hoping it's enough to convince Bob to accept. We're almost at the point where selling to John for $1,000,000 becomes more attractive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting close to my ideal price, but I'm running out of rounds.  With only 2 rounds left, I'm not confident I can get a higher price from Bob.  It's time to secure the deal with John for $1,000,000.  It's a guaranteed profit and ensures I don't lose out on a good deal."
