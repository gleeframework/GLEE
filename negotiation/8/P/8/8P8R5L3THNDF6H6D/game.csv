"I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing it.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $900,000 is tempting, I know the true value of this product is significantly higher.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. I believe this price point reflects the unique benefits and potential it holds.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. I think this is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value without breaking the bank.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
