"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own something special, and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $180. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

You can get the product for $150 from John, so it makes no sense to pay $180 to Alice."
