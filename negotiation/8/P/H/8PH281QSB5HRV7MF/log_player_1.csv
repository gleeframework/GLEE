"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What do you think?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $700,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $900,000. This is a very competitive offer for a product of this caliber."", 
""product_price"": 900000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget in mind. Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, indicating a willingness to negotiate. We're still significantly below the product's value to both of us, and getting closer to John's offer. It's worth pushing a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price. Let's make this happen. How about we settle at $850,000? That's a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to close this deal."", 
""product_price"": 850000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  This counteroffer makes a substantial move towards Bob's price while still staying comfortably above John's offer. It signals a willingness to compromise but maintains the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting close. I can do $800,000, but that's my absolute limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob's offer now matches John's offer. There's no strategic advantage to continuing the negotiation or waiting for a potentially better offer from Bob in later rounds. Accepting now guarantees the best possible outcome at this point."
