"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $700,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $900,000. This is a very competitive offer for a product of this caliber.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price. Let's make this happen. How about we settle at $850,000? That's a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to close this deal.",850000.0,Alice,5,
