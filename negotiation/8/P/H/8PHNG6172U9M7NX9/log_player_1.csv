It's time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Profitable Price:** $1,080,000 is a significant profit over your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation Trend:** Bob has been consistently increasing his offer, indicating his strong interest in the product.
* **Time Value:** Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether.  You have a good offer on the table now."
