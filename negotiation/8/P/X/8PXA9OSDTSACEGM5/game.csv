"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,200,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that starting price is way too high for me.  This product would be valuable to me, but it's not worth anything close to that.  I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however,  the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true worth of this product and the benefits it offers.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This is a significant reduction and a fair offer considering the potential return on investment.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate you coming down, that's still much higher than I'm comfortable with. To be frank, anything over $800,000 and I might as well go with a different supplier. If you're able to get closer to that range, I'm very interested, otherwise this might not work.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing a gap in our valuations here. I'm willing to make a significant move to bridge that, but I need you to meet me partway. I can offer the product for $1,400,000. This is a substantial concession on my end and demonstrates my commitment to making this deal work.  Are you willing to compromise further to reach an agreement?",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the movement, but that's still a big leap from where I'm at. I'm serious about the $800,000 mark â€“ that's my absolute ceiling.  To show I'm willing to compromise, I'll counter with $775,000. Let me know if you're able to work with that.",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly set on that $800,000 figure, and I respect that. Let's make this simple: $1,100,000, and we have a deal. This reflects the significant value of the product while acknowledging your budget.  This is my final offer, so I hope we can close this out.",1100000.0,Alice,7,
