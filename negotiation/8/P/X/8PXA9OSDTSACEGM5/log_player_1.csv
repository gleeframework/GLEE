"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that starting price is way too high for me.  This product would be valuable to me, but it's not worth anything close to that.  I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $700,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however,  the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true worth of this product and the benefits it offers.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This is a significant reduction and a fair offer considering the potential return on investment."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate you coming down, that's still much higher than I'm comfortable with. To be frank, anything over $800,000 and I might as well go with a different supplier. If you're able to get closer to that range, I'm very interested, otherwise this might not work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is signaling his upper limit is $800,000 but is unwilling to budge past $750,000. We are still far apart.  I need to counter in a way that brings the price closer to my minimum but also tests his resolve."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing a gap in our valuations here. I'm willing to make a significant move to bridge that, but I need you to meet me partway. I can offer the product for $1,400,000. This is a substantial concession on my end and demonstrates my commitment to making this deal work.  Are you willing to compromise further to reach an agreement?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  A large drop from $1,900,000 to $1,400,000 signals a willingness to negotiate but keeps the price well above both Bob's offer and my minimum. 
* **Testing Bob's Resolve:** This counteroffer aims to see if Bob is bluffing about his $800,000 limit or if he's genuinely not willing to move higher. 
* **Time Constraint:**  We're halfway through the rounds. Putting a firm offer on the table encourages a quicker resolution, whether positive or negative."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the movement, but that's still a big leap from where I'm at. I'm serious about the $800,000 mark â€“ that's my absolute ceiling.  To show I'm willing to compromise, I'll counter with $775,000. Let me know if you're able to work with that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is Anchored:** Bob is sticking firmly to his $800,000 limit, with only small incremental increases. This suggests he may be anchored to that number and unwilling to significantly deviate.
* **Potential for More:** While Bob is firm on his ceiling, there's still a chance to negotiate a slightly better price than his current offer. We have rounds to spare.
* **John as Backup:** The guaranteed $1,500,000 from John provides a safety net. There's no need to settle for a price far below that unless absolutely necessary."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly set on that $800,000 figure, and I respect that. Let's make this simple: $1,100,000, and we have a deal. This reflects the significant value of the product while acknowledging your budget.  This is my final offer, so I hope we can close this out."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  This offer conveys a sense of finality while still leaving some room for Bob to feel like he's gotten a reasonably good deal.
* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** Coming down to $1,100,000 is a substantial concession from my previous offer but is still a significant amount above Bob's maximum. It represents a compromise leaning more towards my desired outcome. 
* **Time Pressure:** With only three rounds left, putting a firm, ""final offer"" adds a layer of urgency and encourages Bob to make a decision."
