"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident you'll find this offer hard to beat.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,150,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. It's a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that should satisfy both of our needs.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,050,000. This price is fair, and it allows us both to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement at this price.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is a slight concession from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,025,000 for the product.  This price is fair, and it allows us both to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",1025000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're willing to pay $1,025,000, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that takes into account your previous offers and the value of the product to you.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
