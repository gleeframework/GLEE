Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

However, the value of this product is significantly higher for me, and $2,300,000 is a fair reflection of that. How about we meet closer to the middle at $1,900,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the true value of the product."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,500,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.

This is a good spot to accept the offer. Here's why:

* **Matching John's Offer:** Bob's offer now matches what John is willing to pay. While we might be able to squeeze a bit more from Bob, there's no guarantee. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Every round that passes is a potential loss, as we could be closing the deal with John and having the money work for us.
* **Risk of Pushing Too Far:**  If we reject this offer, Bob might walk away, leaving us with nothing better than John's offer."
