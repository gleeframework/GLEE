"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a valuable product that I believe would significantly benefit you. Given its potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is better than John's price, there's room for negotiation. 
* **More information is needed.**  Bob doesn't have enough information about the product's value to him to make a final decision yet. 
* **Counteroffers are an option.**  By rejecting the offer, Bob can start the negotiation process and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works better for both of us.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the value of this product is truly significant.  I could come down to $1,350,000.  This is a fair offer considering the benefits it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's a slight improvement, it's still significantly more than what Bob is willing to pay.
* **Negotiation is ongoing.** Alice is showing flexibility, suggesting there's still room for further negotiation. 
* **Counteroffer is the best strategy.** By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue to try and get a better price, potentially closer to his desired $1,200,000."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand the value of this product, but $1,350,000 is still a bit outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering our previous discussions. Let's see if we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Let's make this happen - I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a very competitive price for a product of this caliber.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's final offer is still higher than Bob's desired price.**  While it's a good offer, it's still more than Bob wants to pay. 
* **There's room for a slight compromise.** Both parties have shown flexibility, and a small adjustment to the price could potentially lead to a deal.
* **Counteroffer is the best course of action.**  A final counteroffer gives Bob the chance to secure a price closer to his target while potentially closing the deal."

Round 6

{""message"": ""Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is closer, $1,300,000 is still a bit outside my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,275,000.
