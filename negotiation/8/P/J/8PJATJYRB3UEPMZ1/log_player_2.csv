"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  He can likely get a better deal by counteroffering."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid $1,000,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $1,050,000 is a good price, especially since he can buy it from John for $1,200,000.  There's a chance he could negotiate a lower price, but there's also a chance Alice will walk away, forcing him to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer is the safest and most financially advantageous choice at this point."
