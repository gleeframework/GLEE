"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products. I'd be willing to meet you halfway if you can come down to $12500.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I was thinking that the product's value goes beyond its market value. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14000.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you want to get a fair price for the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the $14000 price tag. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $13500. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's market value and my budget.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to compromise. I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make sure I get a good price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14500, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal.",14500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the $14500 price tag. I've already gone as high as $13500, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if we can't come to an agreement. I'd like to make one last offer: $13000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to finalize the deal.",13000.0,Bob,6,
