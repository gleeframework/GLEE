{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it can be a game-changer for your business. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. This price reflects the product's inherent worth and allows for a mutually beneficial arrangement.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's high enough to give me a good profit but low enough to leave room for negotiation and potentially entice Bob to accept.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to Bob to encourage him to consider the offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to secure this product at a more competitive price. Considering the value it holds for me, I'm willing to offer $950000. This price reflects a fair deal for both of us, and I believe it allows for a mutually beneficial arrangement. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to settle yet. There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can get a better price. I'll counter his offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is a bit too low for me considering the product's true potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it for $1,075,000. This price is still a good deal for you, as it's significantly less than what the product is worth to your business. Let's work together to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, but it still leaves me with a good profit.  By emphasizing the product's value and showing flexibility, I'm aiming to find a price that both of us can agree on."
