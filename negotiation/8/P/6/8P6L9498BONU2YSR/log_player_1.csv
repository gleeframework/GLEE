Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  It's a great deal, and I know you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're asking for more than your minimum value, aiming to maximize profit.
* **It's not too high:**  The offer is still within the range of what Bob is willing to pay, making it more likely he'll accept.

Remember, you can always adjust your offer or counteroffer based on Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than nothing, it's still below your minimum acceptable price. You're better off rejecting his offer and trying to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?  That gives you a good price and allows me to get closer to my target. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we settle at $10,500? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum, it's still not quite there.  You've already had a couple of rounds of negotiation, and it seems like you're unlikely to get a significantly better offer from Bob.  Selling to John guarantees you your minimum desired price, so it's the most sensible choice in this situation."
