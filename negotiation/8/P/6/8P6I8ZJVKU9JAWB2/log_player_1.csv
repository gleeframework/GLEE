Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment.  I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, so you can afford to be bold with Bob.
* **Testing the Waters:**  Starting with a significantly higher price ($1,500,000) allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potential for negotiation.  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Even if Bob pushes back on the initial price, there's space to come down while still exceeding your minimum.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" to justify the high price, even though we know Bob values it at $1,000,000. 

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob accepts:** You get a fantastic deal at $1,500,000.
* **Bob negotiates:** You have the opportunity to negotiate down, potentially settling around $1,250,000 or higher. 
* **Bob rejects:** You still sell to John at your comfortable minimum of $1,000,000."
