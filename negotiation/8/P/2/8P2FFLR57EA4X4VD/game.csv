"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your asking price is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for it. Let me know if that works for you.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. Is this a price you'd be comfortable with?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That being said, $12,000 is still a little steep for me.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is still a bit lower than my minimum, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $11,500. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Is this something you'd be willing to accept?",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close.  How about we split the difference and close the deal at $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,750. I can offer it to you for $11,000, which is still a good compromise considering the value of the product. Is this something you'd be willing to accept?",11000.0,Alice,7,
