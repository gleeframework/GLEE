Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,750. I can offer it to you for $11,000, which is still a good compromise considering the value of the product. Is this something you'd be willing to accept?

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $11,000. It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially ending up with a worse deal or missing out entirely. You're better off taking the guaranteed $10,000 offer from John."
