"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is within his budget, he can potentially get a better deal by negotiating.  Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. Offering $9,500 is a bold move, but it leaves room for negotiation and shows Bob is serious about getting a good deal.  Alice might accept, but if not, Bob has several rounds left to work towards a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,800 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  While there are more rounds of negotiation, it's likely Alice will not budge much further.  Therefore, it's more advantageous for Bob to purchase the product from John for $10,000, securing the best possible price within his budget."
