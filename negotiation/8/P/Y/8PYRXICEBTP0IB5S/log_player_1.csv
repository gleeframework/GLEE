Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is way too high for me. I'm only interested in paying a price that's fair to both of us.  Given my research and the value I see in this product, I'm willing to offer $800,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While I understand your perspective, $800,000 is significantly below the market value of this product and the value it can bring.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this price point reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

Although Bob is increasing his offer, he's moving in smaller increments and is still significantly below John's offer. It's unlikely he'll reach $1,500,000 in the remaining rounds.  Selling to John guarantees the best outcome for me at this point."
