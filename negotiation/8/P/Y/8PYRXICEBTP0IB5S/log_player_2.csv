"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,200,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $2,200,000 is far too high.  It's significantly above your maximum budget of $800,000.  It's best to reject and start counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is way too high for me. I'm only interested in paying a price that's fair to both of us.  Given my research and the value I see in this product, I'm willing to offer $800,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for coming back with a proposal. While I understand your perspective, $800,000 is significantly below the market value of this product and the value it can bring.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this price point reflects the true worth of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,900,000 is still too high for me. While it's a reduction, it's not enough to make it worthwhile for me.  It's worth continuing to negotiate and seeing if I can get a lower price.  I can still buy from John for $800,000 if the negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,900,000 is still too much for me.  I understand you want a fair price, and I'm trying to be fair as well.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,100,000.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a compromise. I've tried to be flexible, but the $1,100,000 offer is still too low for me to accept. This product has significant value that goes beyond its price tag.  To meet you closer to the middle ground, I'm willing to accept $1,600,000 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to my desired price, $1,600,000 is still over my budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate, seeing if I can get her down even further. If we don't reach a deal, I can still buy from John for $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm trying to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, but that's my absolute limit.  Let's see if we can reach a deal on this price."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
