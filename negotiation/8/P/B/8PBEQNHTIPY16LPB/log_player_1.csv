Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to $120 as possible, as that's the maximum I can earn elsewhere.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $119 allows a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **Appear Reasonable:** Offering a price slightly below my guaranteed sale price might make Bob feel like he's getting a better deal.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough to avoid going to my backup buyer."
