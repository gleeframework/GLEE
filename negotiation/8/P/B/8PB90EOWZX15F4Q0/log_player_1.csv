"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a common strategy in negotiations to see if there's room for compromise. I'm also leaving some room for myself to lower the price if necessary.  I'm confident I can get at least $100 for the product, but I'm hoping to get more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm confident I can get a better price. I'm willing to go through a few more rounds of negotiation to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price, but it's a good starting point for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but I'm still holding firm on getting more than Bob's initial offer. I believe this price is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again.  While $95 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still do better. I'm confident that I can get $100 from Bob in the next round, or if not, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to lower my price to $105. This is my final offer before I'll accept John's offer of $100. I'm confident that Bob will see the value in accepting my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. While Bob's offer of $98 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I've reached the point where I'm comfortable accepting John's offer of $100.  It's a guaranteed sale, and I'm confident I won't get a better offer from Bob in the remaining rounds."
