"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is too low for me to consider. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,750,000?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,750,000 is still outside my comfortable range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000.  This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me and your potential profit. Let's see if we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Explanation: While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach the $1,500,000 mark that John is readily offering. Accepting John's offer guarantees the best possible outcome for Alice at this point."
