"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is too low for me to consider. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,750,000 is still outside my comfortable range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000.  This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me and your potential profit. Let's see if we can close the deal.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
