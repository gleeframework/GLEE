"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low, and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a fair price given the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit steep. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob is getting closer, his offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,075,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $1,090,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1090000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $1,090,000 is still a little too high for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm offering $1,080,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is getting close to my minimum.  With only 4 rounds left, it's better to close the deal now than risk a stalemate or having to sell to John for a lower price."
