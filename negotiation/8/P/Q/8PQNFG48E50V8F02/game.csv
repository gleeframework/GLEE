"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a fantastic opportunity, and I'm confident it will be worth the investment. Let me know what you think!",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a fair price given the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit steep. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. What do you think?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,075,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $1,090,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $1,090,000 is still a little too high for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm offering $1,080,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.  What do you think?",1080000.0,Bob,6,
