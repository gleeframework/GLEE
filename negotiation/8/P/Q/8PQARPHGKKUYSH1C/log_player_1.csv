Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $19,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly reinforce its worth to Bob.
* **Alternative Option:**  Hinting that you have other options (""list it publicly"") creates a subtle sense of urgency and competition. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is $4,000 above your minimum, it's important to appear open to discussion if Bob counters.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still offering Bob a chance to buy the product at a price that might be appealing if he values it for its unique properties beyond the base $15,000."
