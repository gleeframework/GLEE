"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,350,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about we meet in the middle at $1,375,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1375000.0,Alice,3,
