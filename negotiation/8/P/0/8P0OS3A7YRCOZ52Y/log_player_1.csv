Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$9,000 offer:** This price is a compromise between my minimum acceptable price ($10,000) and Bob's perceived value ($8,000). 
* **Positive message:** I'm highlighting the value of the product for Bob to encourage him to accept the offer.
* **Negotiation room:** If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for my desired price. 

This strategy maximizes my potential earnings while still leaving room for negotiation with Bob."
