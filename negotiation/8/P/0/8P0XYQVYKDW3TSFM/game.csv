"Hi Alice, thanks for showing me the product.  $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $9,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $9,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about $7,000? That's a fair offer.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $8,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close. I'm willing to offer $7,500. This is my final offer, as I know I can get it for $8,000 elsewhere.",7500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $7,500, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm thinking of a price of $8,250. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",8250.0,Alice,7,
