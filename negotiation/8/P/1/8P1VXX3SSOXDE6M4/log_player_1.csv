{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. I know it's worth $80 to you, but I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to get as close to $100 as possible. This offer gives Bob some room to negotiate, but it also signals that I'm not willing to sell for a significantly lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum of $100. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
``` 
I'm lowering my price a bit, but I'm still above my minimum and within a reasonable range for a negotiation. This counteroffer shows I'm willing to compromise while still trying to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but $105 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum, it's still below it. I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potentially lose even more money. John is offering a guaranteed $100, which is my minimum and allows me to maximize my profit. Therefore, I will sell the product to John."
