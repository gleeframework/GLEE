Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept for the product. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's better to close the deal than to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the sale altogether."
