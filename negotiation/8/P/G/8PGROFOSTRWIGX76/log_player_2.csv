"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  It's above your maximum price of $150, and you're aiming to save as much as possible.
* **Rejecting allows for negotiation.** By rejecting, you can start a counteroffer process to potentially get a better price. 
* **Buying from John is not ideal yet.** While John's price is your limit, you want to see if you can get it cheaper from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $140 is a bit high for me. How about $130? I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget I need to stick to."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $130 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $135.  This is a great deal for a product you value at $150, and I believe it's fair for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your desired price.** You want to save as much as possible, and you still have room for negotiation.
* **Rejecting keeps the negotiation going.** By continuing to counteroffer, you might be able to get closer to your goal of $130.
* **Buying from John is still not ideal.**  While his price is your maximum, you're still trying to get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $135 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get it for $132.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 132}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $133. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $133. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $133
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your desired price.**  You're aiming for $130, and $133 is only $3 more.
* **There's a good chance you won't get a better price.**  You've already rejected several offers, and Alice may be firm on this price.
* **Buying from John is more expensive.** You're saving $17 by accepting Alice's offer.

**Overall:** It's a good deal for you, and while you could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the product entirely to John is higher than the potential gain from another counteroffer."
