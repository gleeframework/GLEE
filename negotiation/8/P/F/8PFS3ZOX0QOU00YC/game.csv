"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which reflects a reasonable compromise.  This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $950,000 is still not a fair reflection of the product's value. Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer. If it's not acceptable, I'll have to explore other options.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. I hope we can agree on this price.",980000.0,Bob,6,
