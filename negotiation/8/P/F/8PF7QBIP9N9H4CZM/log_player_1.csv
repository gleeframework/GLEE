Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll be ready to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $145 is better than my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my original asking price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $160.  This is still above Bob's offer and closer to my original asking price. I'm hoping this is a compromise that Bob will find acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $155 is better than my minimum of $150 and also better than selling to John for $150.  So I'll accept Bob's offer."
