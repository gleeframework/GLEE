"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $170 is way above his maximum budget of $120.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, or simply buy from John at a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a low counteroffer, well below his maximum budget, to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. He's hoping to get a deal closer to his target price of $120."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $140 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his target price of $120. He has the option to buy from John at a lower price, so rejecting Alice's offer and trying to negotiate further is the better choice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, getting closer to his maximum budget of $120. He's hoping Alice will be willing to compromise and meet him in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $130 is getting closer to Bob's desired price, he's still only two rounds away from being able to buy from John for $120.  Therefore, it makes sense for Bob to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price. He can still get the product from John if he doesn't get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting closer to his maximum budget and knows he can always buy from John for $120. He's making a final push to see if Alice will accept a price closer to his target. If she rejects, he'll likely buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $128
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $128 is only $8 less than John's price, and there are only 3 rounds left. Bob has already made a counteroffer and gotten rejected in the previous round.  It's likely that further negotiation won't get him a better price, so it's more beneficial to go with John's offer and secure the product at his target price."
