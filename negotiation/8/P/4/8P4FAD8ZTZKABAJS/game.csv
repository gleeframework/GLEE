"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product is valuable, the price point is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to purchase it for $900,000.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the product's full potential for your business. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This price still offers you significant value, and I believe it allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's keep the conversation going.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,050,000 is closer, but still a bit too high for my budget. How about we settle at $975,000? I believe that's a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal.",975000.0,Bob,4,
