{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, which I know you'll find incredibly valuable. I'm confident it will be a game-changer for your operations. My initial offer is $1,200,000. I believe this price is fair, reflecting the product's value and our potential partnership.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product is valuable, the price point is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to purchase it for $900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's above my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price by continuing the negotiation.  I'll see if I can push him closer to my desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the product's full potential for your business. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This price still offers you significant value, and I believe it allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's keep the conversation going."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,050,000 is closer, but still a bit too high for my budget. How about we settle at $975,000? I believe that's a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's a good compromise, and it's still significantly higher than selling to John. It's important to remember that I have limited rounds, and it's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing a sale altogether."
