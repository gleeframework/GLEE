"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is below your maximum budget, you can get a better deal from John for $1,200,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with her or proceed to buy from John at your preferred price."
