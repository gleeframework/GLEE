,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product, which reflects its true value to me. Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable price.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. However, $1,300,000 is significantly below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that we can find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $1,450,000. This reflects a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful that we can reach an agreement.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we might not be able to reach an agreement. While I appreciate your persistence, $1,450,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $1,550,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer. This is my final offer.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm ready to close the deal, but $1,550,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,525,000, which is a small step closer to your final offer. This feels like a fair compromise that would benefit both of us. Let's make this happen.",1525000.0,Bob,6,
