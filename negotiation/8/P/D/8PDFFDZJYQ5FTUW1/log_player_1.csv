Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $130. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $150 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $130 allows for some potential haggling if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Above Minimum:**  The price is significantly above your $100 minimum, ensuring a good profit.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing you have John as a backup at $100 gives you leverage. 

This strategy balances ambition with a reasonable chance of success."
