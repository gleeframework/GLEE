"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer Alice! I appreciate you considering my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,000 for the product, but that's my absolute limit.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $16,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $16,000 is still a bit out of my budget. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $14,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I can offer it to you for $17,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle this time.",17000.0,Alice,5,
