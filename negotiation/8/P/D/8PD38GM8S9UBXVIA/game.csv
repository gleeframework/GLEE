"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this product.  While I'm interested, $1,200,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my value for the product and leaves room for us both to walk away with a win. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,175,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm still a little above my budget at $1,175,000.  I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it will be a good deal for both of us.  What do you say?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you. I'm not willing to go any lower, so I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
