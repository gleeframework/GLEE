``` 

This is a good starting point. I'm aiming for a price that's higher than my minimum but still within a range that Bob might be willing to pay. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $14,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is below my minimum, so I can't accept it. I'll try to counteroffer him and see if we can reach a middle ground."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $14,000 is lower than my ideal price, I'm willing to compromise. How about $16,000? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I think it's a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 16000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $15,500? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
