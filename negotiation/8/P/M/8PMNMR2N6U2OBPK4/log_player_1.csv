"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $175.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Positive message:** I'm trying to establish a positive tone and make Bob feel valued as a potential buyer.
* **Open to negotiation:** My message implies that I'm open to discussing the price, signaling flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Room for negotiation:**  While Bob is interested, his offer is not close enough to my minimum. I believe there's still room to negotiate a better price.
* **Not willing to settle:**  Selling to John for $150 would be a better outcome than accepting Bob's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $145? That's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 145} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer strategy:**  Instead of immediately jumping to John's offer, I'm trying to close the gap with Bob.
* **Split the difference:**  Offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer shows a willingness to compromise. 
* **Reiterate value:** I remind Bob about the product's value, subtly hinting that $145 is still a good deal for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $145 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still not at minimum:** $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Closing the gap:** While Bob is getting closer, there's still a $20 difference. I believe we can bridge this gap with further negotiation.
* **Potential for better deal:**  Selling to John for $150 is still the better option at this point, but I'm not willing to give up on Bob just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $135. This is my final offer.  If it's not acceptable, I'll have to move on to another buyer. Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the gap:**  I'm reducing the price by $5, showing flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Final offer:**  Stating this is my ""final offer"" creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to take action. 
* **Alternative option:**  Mentioning another buyer (without naming John) adds pressure and might motivate Bob to accept.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While this is a ""final"" offer, I'm still open to a counteroffer, but at a very limited price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $135 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a breaking point:**  Bob's offer of $125 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Limited negotiation room:**  We've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it's clear Bob is unlikely to go much higher.
* **Time constraint:**  With only 4 rounds left, I'm running out of time to reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John for $150 guarantees me a profit and a better outcome than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
