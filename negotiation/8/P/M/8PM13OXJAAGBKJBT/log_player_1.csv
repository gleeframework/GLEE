Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy behind crafting an offer for Bob:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You won't sell below $1,000,000.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Your Backup:** John guarantees you $1,000,000.

**The Strategy**

The key is to offer a price that is appealing to Bob (meaning it's less than $1,200,000) but also maximizes your profit.  Offering a price too close to $1,200,000 risks Bob rejecting the offer.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000."",
""product_price"": 1100000 
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message Tone:**  Confident and positions the product as valuable.
* **Price Point:** $1,100,000 gives Bob a $100,000 gain while securing you a $100,000 profit above your minimum. 

**Important Notes**

* This assumes Bob is rational and primarily motivated by financial gain. 
* There's always a risk Bob might reject the offer, so you have to weigh that against the potential for a higher profit."
