Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still think $2,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,300,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value and the market conditions.

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable offer, it's still significantly less than John's guaranteed offer. It makes more financial sense to secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John at this point."
