"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $120?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice, $120 is a bit steep for me. How about $85? I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go any higher.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $105?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $105 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $95. This is my final offer, as I can get it elsewhere for $80.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $95, which is $100. Is that something you'd be interested in?",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm ready to pay $97.50, which is right in the middle of our last two offers.  Let's close this deal.",97.5,Bob,6,
