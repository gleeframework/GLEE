Bob has consistently shown a willingness to negotiate and is now offering a price that is a good deal higher than your fallback option with John. While you could potentially push for a bit more in further rounds, the risk of him dropping out of the negotiation increases. Accepting his offer of $1,060,000 secures a significant profit."
