I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $850,000 is better than selling to John, I still believe I can get closer to my target price of $950,000. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $850,000 is tempting, I'm not willing to go lower than $900,000 at this point. I'm confident I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round, but this will be my last offer before I consider selling to John."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $860,000 for the product. Can you reconsider?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $860,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $880,000. While I could counteroffer again, it's getting late in the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $800,000."
