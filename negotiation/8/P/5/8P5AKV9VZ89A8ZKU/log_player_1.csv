Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a lower price of $800000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal with Bob or sell to John for my floor price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 is unfortunately not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I need something closer to my value.  How about $1,050,000?  This allows both of us to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the flexibility, I still feel that $800000 represents a fair value for the product. Let's aim for a compromise at $950000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $950,000 is getting closer to my target, I'm still not at my floor price.  I'm confident I can either get a better price from Bob or secure the sale with John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000.
