{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$500,000 is a great price, but it's still early in the negotiation. There's a good chance I can get it for even lower. I'll reject the offer and try to counter with a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a bold counteroffer, aiming for a significant discount.  $300,000 is a much lower price than Alice's initial offer.  It's a gamble, but I'm hoping she'll be willing to negotiate further.  If she rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on her response."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $400,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still quite a bit higher than my target. I'm going to reject the offer and continue to negotiate.  I'm still confident I can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to increase my offer slightly to $350,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still aiming for a price below her last offer. This is a compromise, and hopefully, Alice will see it as a reasonable offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $450,000 is getting closer to my target, I'm still hesitant to accept. I believe there's room for further negotiation, especially since I'm confident in the value I'm placing on this product.  I'm not willing to settle just yet, and I'll continue to push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to meet Alice halfway this time and offer $400,000. This shows her that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm also standing firm on my desire to get a lower price than her last offer. We're getting closer, and I'm hoping this offer will be accepted."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $475,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my target price. While I still have a few rounds left to negotiate, I don't want to risk getting too close to the deadline and having to buy from John at a much higher price. $475,000 is a fair compromise, and it's still a significant saving compared to John's price.  I'll accept this offer and secure the product."
