"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I really appreciate it. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. Would you consider $11,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can make this deal work.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not sure I can go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we try $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $11,500. That's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $12,250? It's a fair compromise that gets you a great deal, and I still make a decent profit.",12250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $12,250 is still higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's try to reach a final agreement. I'm willing to offer $11,750. That's a fair price that gives you a solid profit while also allowing me to stay within my budget. It's our last offer, so what do you say?",11750.0,Bob,6,
