"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a good value.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $900,000 is simply not enough for me to consider. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $975,000?  This would be a good compromise, and I believe you'll still find it a good deal.",975000.0,Alice,5,
