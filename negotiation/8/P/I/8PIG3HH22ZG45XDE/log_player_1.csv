Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first for $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial high price will give you valuable information about his level of interest and potential willingness to pay a premium. 
* **Fallback Option:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $80, so there's little risk in aiming high with Bob. If he rejects the offer, you haven't lost anything. 

Remember, this is just the opening move. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters your initial offer."
