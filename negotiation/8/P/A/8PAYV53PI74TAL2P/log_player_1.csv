Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a high initial offer, designed to gauge Bob's potential interest and leave room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While $1,500,000 is my ideal price, it's not my absolute minimum. There's room for negotiation, and I can still profit comfortably even if I settle for a lower price.
* **Avoiding the ""John"" Option:**  I'm not immediately resorting to selling to John for $1,000,000. I believe there's potential to get a better price from Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely monitor Bob's response. If he rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a counter-counteroffer. My goal is to find a price that maximizes my profit while still securing a sale."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is closer to my minimum, but I still believe I can get a better price.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  By rejecting Bob's counteroffer, I'm signaling that I'm not desperate to sell and that I'm willing to continue negotiating. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I'm hoping that by rejecting, I can push Bob further towards my desired price range.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counter-counteroffer to Bob in the next round.  My goal is to find a price that is closer to my initial asking price, but still acceptable to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm offering $1,350,000, which is halfway between my previous offer of $1,500,000 and Bob's counteroffer of $1,200,000. 
* **Showing Flexibility:** This counteroffer demonstrates that I'm willing to be flexible and come down from my original asking price. 
* **Avoiding Stalemate:** I believe this price is likely to be appealing to Bob without sacrificing too much of my profit margin.

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely monitor Bob's response to this counteroffer.  If he rejects, I'll reassess my strategy and decide whether to make a further concession or sell to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Balancing Profit and Negotiation:** Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is a reasonable compromise. It's only a small step down from my last counteroffer of $1,350,000, and it's still a significant profit for me.
* **Avoiding Further Negotiations:**  I believe that pushing for a higher price at this point risks losing the deal altogether.  Bob may become frustrated with my persistence and decide to walk away.
* **Securing the Deal:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale, which is my primary goal.

**Next Steps:**

I will accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale of the product for $1,250,000."
