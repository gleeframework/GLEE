Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm suggesting a price of $1,100,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its worth in the current market. Let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

Here's the reasoning behind this offer:

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($800,000) as possible while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000).
* **Negotiating Room:** Offering $1,100,000 leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Alternative Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, so there's no risk of ending up with no sale. 

This strategy aims to secure a significant profit while keeping the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider seriously."
