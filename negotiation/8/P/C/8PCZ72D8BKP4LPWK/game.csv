"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",925000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $925,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective on the price. While $750,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet halfway and settle on $837,500?  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value.",837500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the compromise, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $837,500. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, but that's my maximum. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
