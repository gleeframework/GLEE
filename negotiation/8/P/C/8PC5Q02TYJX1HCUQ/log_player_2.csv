"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd really be interested in. It's worth at least $150 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $135. This is a great deal for both of us, so let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:** The product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice is selling the product for $135.
* **John's Offer:** John is selling the product for $150.

Since Alice's offer is lower than John's offer, and still within Bob's budget, it's the better choice to accept Alice's offer.  Bob saves $15 by buying from Alice."
