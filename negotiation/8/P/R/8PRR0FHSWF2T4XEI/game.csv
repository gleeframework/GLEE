"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth $1,000,000 to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. This product is interesting to me, but $800,000 is a bit steep. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $800,000 might be a bit high, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $725,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",725000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming closer to my budget. However, I'm still a bit away from that price point.  Would you consider $650,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a fair compromise, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $650,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $675,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you.",675000.0,Alice,5,
