Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,750,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You want at least $1,500,000, so $1,750,000 leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's not too aggressive:**  A much higher price could immediately make Bob walk away. 
* **It's friendly:**  The message is polite and encourages Bob to engage.

Remember, this is just the first step. Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response. Good luck!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price. While $1,100,000 is better than nothing, it's not a good deal for you.  You have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,500,000, so it's not worth risking a lower price at this point.

**Next steps:**

You will now need to counter Bob's offer.  Since Bob is willing to pay at least $1,100,000, you should try to meet somewhere in the middle.  You could start with an offer slightly below your desired price, but still above $1,100,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. Considering the value of this product to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer is a significant step down from your initial offer, showing flexibility while still remaining above your minimum price.
* **Focus on value:** The message reiterates the product's value to Bob, subtly reminding him of the benefits he'll get by purchasing it.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message ends by stating your willingness to find a mutually beneficial solution, encouraging further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see you're coming down, but I need you to meet me closer to my price range. How about $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's getting closer, you still have a guaranteed sale to John for a higher price. It's not worth risking a lower price at this point.

**Next steps:**

You should send Bob a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to your desired price range. You can either slightly lower your last counteroffer or try a different price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $1,200,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,300,000?  That's a fair price, and it would get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This counteroffer splits the difference between your previous offer ($1,400,000) and Bob's latest offer ($1,200,000). 
* **Highlighting fairness:** The message emphasizes the ""fairness"" of the price, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Urgency:**  The message emphasizes closing the deal, encouraging Bob to accept to avoid losing the opportunity."
