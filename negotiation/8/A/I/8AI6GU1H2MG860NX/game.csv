"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $950,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering the potential benefits it holds for you.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you recognizing the value of the product. However, $950,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000, reflecting the product's value to me while giving you a good profit margin.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is below its true worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This reflects the value it brings to both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $900,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to pay $875,000.  This would be a fair compromise, allowing us both to get a good deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
