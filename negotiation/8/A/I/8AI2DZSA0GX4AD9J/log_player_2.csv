"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Since Alice's offer is exactly the same price as John's, there's no benefit to negotiating with Alice. You're guaranteed to get the product for the same price from John, so there's no reason to risk a potentially unsuccessful negotiation."
