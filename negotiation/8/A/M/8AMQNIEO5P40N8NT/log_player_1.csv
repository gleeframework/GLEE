"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110.  I think it's a great deal considering its value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Opening High:** Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Reasonable Offer:** $110 is still within a reasonable range, considering my minimum value is $100. This makes the offer less likely to be immediately rejected. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message conveys my willingness to negotiate, which can encourage Bob to counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Bob's Offer:** $90 is below my minimum acceptable value of $100. Accepting it would mean taking a loss. 
* **Negotiating Further:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, there's still room for negotiation. I have 8 more rounds to work with, and I can likely get a better price. 
* **Not Selling to John Yet:** $100 is my minimum, and John's offer is my safety net. I'm not desperate to sell, so I'm not going to accept John's offer just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $90 is still a little low for me.  How about $95? I'm willing to meet you halfway, as I do think this product would be a great value for you."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  Offering $95 is a compromise, showing a willingness to negotiate. It's still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer.
* **Highlighting Value:** Emphasizing the product's value for Bob might persuade him to accept.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** $95 is still a good deal for me, and I have more rounds to negotiate if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Bob's Offer:** $85 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $100. Accepting it would result in a loss.
* **Continuing Negotiation:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, there's still room for negotiation. I have 6 more rounds to work with and can likely get a better price. 
* **Not Selling to John Yet:** $100 is my minimum, and John's offer is my safety net. I'm not desperate to sell, so I'm not going to accept John's offer just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $85 is just too low for me.  Let's compromise again. I'm willing to drop my price to $92. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 92}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $92 is still above my minimum acceptable value, but it shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasis on Compromise:**  The message emphasizes my willingness to work with Bob and find a middle ground.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I have 5 rounds left, and I can still get a better price if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $82 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $82 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $100. 
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:**  We are nearing the end of the negotiation process with only 4 rounds left.  
* **John's offer is a safe bet:**  John's offer of $100 guarantees my minimum value.  There is a high risk of Bob continuing to offer a lower price, and I don't want to lose out on a guaranteed profit.

Given these factors, selling to John is the most logical choice. It ensures a profitable sale and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
