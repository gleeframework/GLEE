"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500.",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However,  $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  Would you be open to $10,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a good value for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, as it's still above my minimum price of $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really hoping to get it closer to $10,500. Would you consider that? It's a fair price for a product that's valuable to both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,750. This is already a significant concession from my initial offer, and I'm not comfortable going below that. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair value for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",10750.0,Alice,5,
