Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it's worth the price of $119."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible, without going below my minimum ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While I start high, the slightly odd price of $119 might seem like a deal already and leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  Even if Bob rejects my offer, I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $120."
