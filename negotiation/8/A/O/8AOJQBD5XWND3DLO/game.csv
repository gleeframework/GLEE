,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to meet in the middle, but I'm not quite there yet. I can do $750000, which is a significant concession from my initial offer. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle from there.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  I'm getting closer, but $750,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you consider $700,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! I can see you're serious about the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $750000, so I'll offer it to you for $725000. That's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a great deal for both of us.",725000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're tough!  I respect that.  I'm also serious about buying this product, but I need to stay within my budget. How about $710,000? That's a very strong offer.",710000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're willing to make some concessions, Bob. I appreciate that. I'm willing to meet you at $715000, which is just $5000 above your last offer. I think that's a fair compromise, considering the value of the product.",715000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting down to the wire here.  I'm willing to offer $712,000 - my final offer. This is a fair price, and I need to know if you're willing to make this deal.",712000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $715000. I've already given you a great deal, and I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to hold out for the price I want, but I'm also open to other buyers. I'll keep this offer on the table for now, but I'm not making any further concessions.",715000.0,Alice,9,
