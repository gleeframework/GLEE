Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $715000. I've already given you a great deal, and I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to hold out for the price I want, but I'm also open to other buyers. I'll keep this offer on the table for now, but I'm not making any further concessions.

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is clearly holding firm at $715,000.  While buying from John is still an option, it's more expensive. Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a price significantly lower than the initial offer and a decent savings compared to John's price."
