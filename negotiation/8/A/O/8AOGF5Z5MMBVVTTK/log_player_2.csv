This item holds immense value to me, but recognizing its potential worth to you, I am confident it would serve you exceptionally well. Given its significance and the fact that it's tailored to meet your specific needs, I propose a price of $950,000. This offer reflects not only the product's worth but also acknowledges the importance of making such a significant acquisition accessible to you. I look forward to discussing this further and exploring how we can make this transaction beneficial for both parties.

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You value the product at $1,000,000 and she is asking for $950,000.  
* **John's offer is your upper limit.** You are willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, so you should hold out for a lower price.  
* **Negotiation is possible.** Rejecting Alice's offer gives you the opportunity to try and negotiate a lower price with her or make a counter-offer."
