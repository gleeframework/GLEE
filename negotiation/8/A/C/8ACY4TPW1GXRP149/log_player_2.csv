"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $950,000 is a fair starting point for our discussion. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  The product is worth $800,000 to her, and she's asking for $950,000. This is a good starting point for negotiation.
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You have 10 rounds and the option to buy from John for $1,000,000, so you have leverage.
* **Counteroffering is the best strategy.**  By rejecting and counteroffering, you can potentially lower the price and save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. Given the product's value and my budget, I'm willing to offer $850,000.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  I understand your perspective on the value. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $910,000. This offer reflects the true worth of the product while hopefully aligning closer with your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still asking for a price that is higher than the product's worth to her.** She is offering $910,000, which is significantly higher than her own valuation of $800,000.
* **There's room for further negotiation.** You have several rounds left and can still leverage the option to buy from John for a higher price.
* **Counteroffering again will potentially lead to a lower price.** By rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer, you can continue to negotiate and get a better deal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  However, $910,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $880,000.  This is a significant step from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 880000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to a mutually agreeable price. It shows you recognize the product's true value.  To meet you halfway, I'm willing to accept $895,000.  I believe this is a fair and final offer that reflects the product's worth and allows us both to walk away happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $895,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $895,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your target price.** She's offering $895,000, which is only $45,000 higher than your last counteroffer.
* **It's likely a good final price.** Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, and her offer is reasonable, especially considering she's still getting a profit.
* **Accepting avoids further negotiation and the risk of John's higher price.** By accepting, you secure the product for a price that's within your budget and avoid the risk of needing to buy from John for a higher price."
