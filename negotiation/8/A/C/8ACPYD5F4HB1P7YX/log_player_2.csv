"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

This is a very high price, and Bob should try to negotiate a lower price.  Going to John is a last resort, so Bob should explore counteroffers first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, hoping to create a gap that encourages Alice to negotiate. This price is well below Alice's initial offer and closer to Bob's budget, while still leaving room for bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is still too high, but closer to Bob's budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate further before going to John.  The counteroffer will be closer to Alice's price this time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

Bob is now offering a price closer to Alice's last offer, but still below his maximum budget. He's showing flexibility but also demonstrating that he's serious about getting a deal.  This is a good compromise, but it is still a bit risky if Alice is holding out for a higher price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is getting closer, but Bob is still within his budget and can try to negotiate a lower price. He should reject the offer and make another counteroffer.  There are still several rounds left, so Bob should hold out for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

Bob is now offering a price that is almost exactly halfway between his last offer and Alice's. This shows that he is willing to meet in the middle, but still maintains some leverage. This is a good compromise that could potentially lead to a deal in the next few rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is now very close to Bob's maximum budget and it's getting risky to keep rejecting.  While there's always a chance Alice could go lower, there's also a chance she could increase her offer, or the negotiation could drag on.  It's time to accept and secure the purchase."
