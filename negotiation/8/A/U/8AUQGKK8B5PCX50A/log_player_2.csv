"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this product, which is a valuable asset that I'm sure you'll find useful. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,000 is higher than her own valuation ($8,000), it's still lower than your maximum budget of $10,000 and the price John is offering. Accepting this offer saves you $1,000 compared to buying from John."
