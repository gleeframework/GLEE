{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for a price of $1,199,999. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 1199999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to your product's value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with a price slightly below your guaranteed sale price to John ($1,200,000) leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate up, increasing your profit. 
* **Psychological Pricing:** The price of $1,199,999 feels significantly less than $1,200,000, potentially making it more appealing to Bob.

**Important Note:**  While John provides a safety net, it's ideal to secure a deal with Bob if possible. A slightly higher profit is better than potentially waiting for another buyer."
