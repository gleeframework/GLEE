"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's something truly special that I believe can be a game-changer for your business. I'm asking for $1,000,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its potential value to you. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a price of $850,000 for the product.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. The product's value to you is significantly higher, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? This allows me to get closer to my desired price, and still represents a fantastic deal for you.",925000.0,Alice,3,
