Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $12,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to get at least $15,000.
* **John's Offer:** You have a guaranteed offer from John for $15,000.

**Strategy:**

The goal is to get Bob to buy the product for as much as possible above his valuation, without exceeding his limit. Offering it at $14,000 gives Bob a potential ""deal"" (saving $2,000 from your guaranteed sale) while still earning you a profit above your minimum. 

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, since you have John's guaranteed purchase, you're not losing money by attempting to get a higher price from Bob first."
