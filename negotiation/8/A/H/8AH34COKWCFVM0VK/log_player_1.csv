{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product!  It's a valuable asset with a lot of potential. I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000, which I believe is fair considering its worth to both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer starts at a high point, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident that the product is worth more to Bob, so this gives him a reason to negotiate without feeling like I'm being unreasonable.  I'm also setting the tone for a friendly and collaborative negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit high. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob, so I will reject his offer and counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm prepared to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value of this product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $950,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000 and I'm confident I won't be able to get much more from him. I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product."
