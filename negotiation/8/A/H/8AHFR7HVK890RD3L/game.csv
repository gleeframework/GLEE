"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, I'm looking to invest closer to the  $700,000 range. Would you be open to a price around there?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  However, the $700,000 range is significantly below the true value of this product.  I'm willing to negotiate, so let's meet in the middle somewhat. Would $975,000 work for you?",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  That said, $975,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Could we settle around $825,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the product's value.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but the price needs to reflect the true worth of what I'm offering. $900,000 is my final offer, and I believe it's more than reasonable given the value this product brings.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you drive a hard bargain! I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $862,500?  This keeps us both relatively close to our desired prices.",862500.0,Bob,6,
