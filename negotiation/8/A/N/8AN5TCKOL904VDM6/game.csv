"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a bit steep for me, though.  Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $140?  I'm willing to be flexible to make this deal happen.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, $140 is closer but still a bit more than I'm hoping to spend. Could you do $125?",125.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $125 is just too low for me.  This is my final offer: $135.  If you're not willing to go that high, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",135.0,Alice,5,
