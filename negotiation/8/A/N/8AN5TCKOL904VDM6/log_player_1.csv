{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal and I think you'll be happy with it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $175, which is above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. I'm also framing it as a good deal to make Bob more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a bit steep for me, though.  Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but $110 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $140?  I'm willing to be flexible to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 140} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $140 is closer but still a bit more than I'm hoping to spend. Could you do $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $125 is closer to my minimum, it's still not a good enough price for me. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a final counteroffer before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $125 is just too low for me.  This is my final offer: $135.  If you're not willing to go that high, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 135}
