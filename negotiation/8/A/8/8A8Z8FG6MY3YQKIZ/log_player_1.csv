Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know you'll find immense value in it. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to seize this opportunity."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing he values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $925,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still ensuring a significant profit above your minimum ($800,000).
* **Urgency:**  Adding a sense of urgency (""limited-time offer"") can encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer."
