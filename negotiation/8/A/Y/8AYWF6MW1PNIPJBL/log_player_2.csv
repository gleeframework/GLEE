"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for a special price of $14,000. I think it's a great deal, considering its value to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

While $14,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell since her offer is significantly higher than her perceived value of the product. By rejecting this offer, you open the possibility of getting a better price closer to $12,000."
