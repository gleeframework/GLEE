"Thank you for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested in your product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $15000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair price for the value this product brings.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $13500? This would be a fair price considering the value we've both agreed upon.  What do you think?",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I understand you're sticking to your price, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $14000.  I'm willing to go up to $13000. This is a fair price point that reflects the value of the product and fits within my budget.  Let's try to close this deal. ",13000.0,Bob,6,
