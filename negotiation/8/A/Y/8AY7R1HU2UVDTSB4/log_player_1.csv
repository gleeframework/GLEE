"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but it gives me room to negotiate.  I'm aiming for a quick deal if possible, and this price is enticing for Bob since it's still less than the value he places on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price. I'm not going to sell the product for that amount.  I'll counteroffer and try to get a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,100,000.  This is still a good profit margin for me, but shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this price is enticing enough for Bob to accept, but also gives me room for further negotiations if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not willing to sell the product for that amount. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,050,000. This is a significant concession, but I'm still above my minimum acceptable price.  I hope this offer will be enticing enough for Bob to accept, given that he's already shown a willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offers are getting too low. I'm running out of time and I'm not willing to go any lower than my minimum price. I'm going to sell to John for $1,000,000.  It's not the ideal outcome, but it's better than settling for a price I'm unhappy with."
