"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth no more than $8,000 to Bob, so accepting Alice's offer of $10,000 is not a good deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

Bob offers a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within a range he's willing to pay. This starts the negotiation process and gives Alice a chance to respond."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum price of $8,000. He should continue negotiating to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

Bob increases his offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating his willingness to compromise while still staying within his budget.  This could potentially be a more attractive price for Alice compared to his previous offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum price, it's still not ideal. Bob can try to negotiate a slightly lower price in the next round, or if he's feeling risky, he can counteroffer at $8,000.  However, given that he can buy the product from John for $8,000 at any moment, it's safer to continue negotiating for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

Bob is now at his maximum price. He's taking a risk by offering the full amount he's willing to pay, but it's a gamble that might be worth it if Alice is determined to close the deal."
