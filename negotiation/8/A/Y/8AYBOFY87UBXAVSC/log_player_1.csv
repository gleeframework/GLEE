"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, considering the value it holds. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Optimistic Approach:** I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum value ($1,000,000)  in the first round.
* **Positive Tone:** My message is positive and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** By setting a high initial price, I allow space for Bob to make counteroffers, keeping the negotiation dynamic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider meeting me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:** Although $900,000 is a good price, it's still below my desired minimum of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation is Ongoing:** Bob's counteroffer shows he's interested and willing to negotiate. This gives me leverage to try for a higher price.
* **Staying Committed to Goal:** I'm aiming for a price as close to my minimum value as possible. Accepting now would mean missing out on potentially earning more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects the unique value of this product and gives you a fair price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle (Sort of):** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($1,200,000) and Bob's counteroffer ($900,000). This signals a willingness to compromise while still keeping the price above my minimum. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the ""unique value"" of the product to justify the price. This subtly reminds Bob of the potential benefits he'll receive.
* **Positive Tone:** The message remains positive and invites further discussion. This encourages Bob to continue negotiating without feeling pressured."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950000, but that's the highest I can go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum desired price of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation Progress:**  While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, there's still room to negotiate.
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  I believe there's a chance to reach a higher price, potentially even with John, who is willing to pay $1,000,000. 
* **Avoiding Regret:** Accepting now would mean missing out on potentially getting a better price later."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you. I'm willing to drop to $1,000,000. This is my absolute minimum price, but it still represents a great deal for you, given the value you'll get from this product.  I'm confident this will be a win-win situation. Let's close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting the Minimum:** I'm now offering my minimum price,  which is also John's offer. This shows I'm serious about closing the deal.
* **Finality:** I emphasize that this is my ""absolute minimum"" to signal to Bob that further negotiations might not be possible.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I reiterate the ""great deal"" Bob will get, reminding him of the benefits of the product.
* **Positive Closing:** I use a positive closing phrase to encourage Bob to accept and make the deal final."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that this is your minimum price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $925000, but I need to be careful with my expenses. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Negotiation Space:**  Bob's offer is still below my minimum desired price, and he's clearly not willing to go much higher.
* **Time is Running Out:** We are in round 6 out of 10, so time is becoming a factor.
* **John's Offer:**  John is willing to pay my minimum price of $1,000,000, and I don't want to risk missing out on that guaranteed deal. 
* **Avoiding Potential Loss:** If I continue negotiating, there's a risk that I won't reach a deal with Bob, and then I might be left with nothing.  It's better to take the guaranteed profit from John."
