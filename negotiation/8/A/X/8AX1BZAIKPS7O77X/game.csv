"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $650,000 is significantly below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $750,000, reflecting the value we both see in this product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $700,000 is closer,  I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the true value of this product.  How about $725,000? It's a good middle ground that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",725000.0,Alice,5,
