Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you first dibs on this product. I think you'll find it really valuable. How about $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob values the product at $100, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($80).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $90 leaves some wiggle room if Bob wants to haggle. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have John as a backup buyer at $80, ensuring you won't go below your minimum.

By starting high but reasonably, you increase your chances of getting the best possible price from Bob."
