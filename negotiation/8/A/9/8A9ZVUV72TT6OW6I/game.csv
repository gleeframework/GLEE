"I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1500000. I'm willing to walk away if you can't meet me in the middle.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1500000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1750000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1400000. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I really need to stay within my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1400000. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer $1600000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
