Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 2200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This gives you room to negotiate down while still achieving a favorable outcome.
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $2,200,000, you anchor the negotiation at a high point. Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, his counteroffers are likely to be influenced by this starting point.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The significant difference between your asking price and Bob's perceived value leaves ample space for negotiation. You can make concessions throughout the process while still aiming for a final price significantly above $1,500,000. 

**Important:** It's crucial to remain flexible and gauge Bob's reactions throughout the negotiation. If he seems completely turned off by the initial offer, you might need to adjust your strategy more quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's closer to his perceived value, there's still room for negotiation before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true worth of this product and the potential return on your investment.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:**  You're acknowledging Bob's offer and demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Significant but Strategic Concession:**  Dropping to $1,900,000 is a substantial move that might signal to Bob you're serious about finding a deal. However, it's still significantly above both his offer and your minimum. 
* **Justify the Price:** Highlighting the ""true worth"" and ""potential return on investment"" aims to reframe the product's value in Bob's mind, potentially justifying a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'm proposing $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer has dropped significantly to $1,200,000.  This is substantially below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. It's unlikely that further negotiation will close this gap.  You have a guaranteed offer from John at your desired price, so it makes the most financial sense to sell to him at this point."
