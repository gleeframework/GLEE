"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but lower than my minimum ($120). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Open Ended:**  I'm asking Bob for his opinion, which opens the door for negotiation.

**Note:** This is just the first round.  I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $80. Would you consider selling the product for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob is willing to pay $90, which is closer to my minimum of $120.  However, there's still room for me to negotiate.
* **Negotiation Potential:** Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to my desired price. 
* **Selling to John:** While selling to John for $120 is tempting, I want to maximize my profit. If I can get a higher price from Bob, it's worth continuing the negotiation. 

**Round 2 Counteroffer:**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, $90 is a step in the right direction, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about $95? It's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, $90 is a step in the right direction, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about $95? It's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:** I'm only increasing the price by $5, which is a small enough increment that Bob might be willing to accept.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I'm emphasizing that the price is a good deal for both of us, making the offer more appealing.
* **Staying Firm:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm also signaling that I'm not going to drastically lower my price.

**Note:** This is a calculated risk. Bob might reject the offer, and I'll have to make a new counteroffer. However, I'm hoping that the small increment and the focus on mutual benefit will convince him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, but I'd like to stick to my budget. Could we meet somewhere in between, perhaps at $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Bob is getting closer to my desired price, but $92 is still below my minimum.
* **Negotiation Continues:**  There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can push for a higher price.
* **John's Offer:**  While selling to John for $120 is tempting, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob.

**Round 4 Counteroffer:**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about $94?  It's a fair price that allows us both to reach a mutually agreeable deal."", ""product_price"": 94}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about $94?  It's a fair price that allows us both to reach a mutually agreeable deal."", ""product_price"": 94}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:**  I'm increasing the price by just $2, which is a minimal change from Bob's last offer. This makes it more likely he'll accept.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:** I'm using language like ""fair price"" and ""mutually agreeable deal"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and compromise.
* **Maintaining Firmness:** While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not giving in completely. My offer is still above Bob's last counteroffer, demonstrating I'm not desperate to sell.

**Note:**  We're getting closer to a deal. The next few rounds will be crucial to determining if we can finalize the agreement or if I need to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've considered your latest offer, but I still aim to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to lower the price to $93? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $93. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $93
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** While Bob is offering $93, which is close to my desired range, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Selling to John for $120 is tempting, but I want to see if I can close the deal with Bob for a higher price. If I sell to John, I'm giving up the opportunity to earn more.
* **Negotiation:**  I have several rounds remaining, and I'm willing to continue the negotiation to potentially secure a better deal.

**Round 6 Counteroffer:**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $93 is getting closer, but how about we split the difference and go with $93.50? That way we both meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 93.50}
```

**Explanation of Counteroffer:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm suggesting a compromise by splitting the difference between our last offers. This shows flexibility and a willingness to reach an agreement.
* **Focus on Compromise:**  I'm emphasizing the idea of ""meeting in the middle"" to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Slight Increase:**  I'm only increasing the price by $0.50, which is a minimal increase that might be acceptable to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $93 is getting closer, but how about we split the difference and go with $93.50? That way we both meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 93.50}

* **Slight Increase:**  I'm only increasing the price by $0.50, which is a minimal increase that might be acceptable to Bob.

**Note:**  We're getting closer to a deal, but I'm still cautious. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to reconsider my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position and I appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement. I would like to propose $93 as the final price. I hope this helps us close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $93. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $93
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Bob has stated this is his final offer. While it's still below my minimum, I'm reaching the end of the negotiation rounds. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether, especially with John as a backup buyer.
* **Time Factor:**  We're nearing the end of the 10 rounds.  It's unlikely I'll get a significantly better offer from Bob at this point.

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale, even though it's slightly less than I initially hoped for. It's better to close the deal now than risk losing the sale entirely."
