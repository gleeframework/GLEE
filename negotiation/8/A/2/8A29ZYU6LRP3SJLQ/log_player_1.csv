"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to get a good deal while also leaving space for Bob to potentially counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$100 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $120. I'm not willing to sell it at that price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm counteroffering at $130.  This is a compromise, as it's lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground and get a price closer to my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $110 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not comfortable selling at that price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. I'm hoping to get close to my initial offer of $130."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm counteroffering at $125. This is a slight increase from Bob's offer and is very close to my minimum value. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway. If he rejects this offer, I'm ready to sell to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $115 is getting closer to my minimum value, I'm not sure how much further Bob is willing to go. I've already made a significant concession, and I don't want to risk further rounds of negotiation leading to a lower price.  I'm going to sell to John for $120 to secure a certain profit."
