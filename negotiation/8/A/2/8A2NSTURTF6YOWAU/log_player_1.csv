Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This offer reflects the true worth of what you're gaining."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

}
``` 

While I could push for more, accepting $1,100,000 is a significant profit. It's always tempting to try for the absolute highest price, but in negotiation, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. This offer represents a $300,000 gain over my minimum acceptable price, and it's uncertain if further negotiation will yield a better result."
