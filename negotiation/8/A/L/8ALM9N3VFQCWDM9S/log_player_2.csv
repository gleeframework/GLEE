# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product for $1,100,000. I understand it's worth $1,000,000 to you, so this is a fair price that allows for a bit of profit on your end. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $1,200,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.
