``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed, but also shows that I'm confident in the product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm on a tight budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about we meet in the middle at $9,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $9500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8500. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet somewhere in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not happy with it. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can meet somewhere in the middle. If Bob still refuses, I'll go with John's offer."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $8500 is still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to meet you halfway once more and offer the product for $9,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I don't want to lose this opportunity to sell to you. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $9000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $10000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's final offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. It's better to sell to John and get my desired price rather than risk losing out completely."
