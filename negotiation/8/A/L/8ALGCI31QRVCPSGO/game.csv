"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, my budget for this purchase is lower than your initial proposal. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $1,000,000. ",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price. To move this forward, I can come down to $1,300,000. This feels like a fair compromise, considering the benefits the product will bring to your operations.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. To be frank, I have a hard limit at $1,100,000 for this purchase.  If you're able to meet that price, I'm ready to close the deal today.  Otherwise, I may have to explore other options.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $1,100,000 is pushing the boundaries of what I deem acceptable for this product. It's truly valuable and I wouldn't want to devalue it. My final offer is $1,225,000.  This leaves some room for us to find a middle ground. I need a decision on this, as I have other interested parties.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
