"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product, and I think it's a good compromise.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While I see the value in the product, I'm on a tight budget.  Could we do $9,000? I think that's a fair offer.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500, which is $9,750. I think this is a fair price that balances our interests.",9750.0,Alice,5,
