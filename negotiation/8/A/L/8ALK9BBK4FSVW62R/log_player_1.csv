Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to anyone else. I believe its value to you is significant, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close as possible to Bob's walk-away price ($1,200,000) without scaring him off. 
* **Strong Opening:** Starting with a strong offer shows I value the product highly.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning other potential buyers (even if John is my backup) creates a sense of urgency for Bob to act quickly. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While I want a strong opening, leaving some room for negotiation allows for a back and forth that could lead to a mutually agreeable price.

This offer aims to create a win-win situation where Bob feels like he got a good deal while I still secure a substantial profit."
