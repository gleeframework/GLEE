"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product,  $18,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $16,000. This is a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny!",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $14,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $15,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you!",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $15,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $15,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",15000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go down to $15,000. I'm willing to meet you at the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $15,250. This is my final concession, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",15250.0,Alice,7,
