"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to leave room for negotiation while still maximizing my potential profit.  I'll see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum, and while I'd prefer not to go to John, I need to ensure I get a price closer to my desired value. I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still significantly higher than Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this shows flexibility while also demonstrating that I'm not willing to go much lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm going to continue negotiating, but I'm starting to feel the pressure. If his next offer isn't closer to my minimum, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm running out of room. I'm hoping Bob will recognize that this is a fair price given his previous offers. If he doesn't, I'll have to start thinking about selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where I'm not sure if I'll be able to get a better price from Bob, and I'm already on round 6. I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's still a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing out on any profit."
