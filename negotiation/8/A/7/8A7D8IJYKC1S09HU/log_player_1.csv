Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and presents a significant return on investment for you.  Please let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 from John, you aim to get as close to that as possible from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob while staying above your minimum.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value"" and ""potential"" to justify the high price. 

This strategy balances securing a deal with Bob against the risk of him rejecting the offer and accepting John's guaranteed purchase."
