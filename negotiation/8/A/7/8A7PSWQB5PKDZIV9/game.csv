"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. Would you consider selling the product for $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $12,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet halfway!",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still not comfortable with $16,000. How about $14,000? This would allow us to meet closer to the middle of our price range.",14000.0,Bob,4,
