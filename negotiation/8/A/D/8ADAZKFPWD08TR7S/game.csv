"Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $1,000,000 doesn't quite meet my expectations.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still reflects the product's value and allows for a win-win situation for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

This still allows for a reasonable profit for you while staying within my financial limits. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. While $950,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,100,000.  To show my willingness to compromise, I'm willing to accept $1,050,000 for the product. This allows us to meet in the middle and secures a good deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
