This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to the product's value to Bob, but I'm also aware that I can always fall back on John's offer if negotiations with Bob don't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $1,000,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $1,000,000 is better than John's offer, I'm confident I can get closer to the product's value to Bob. I will counteroffer and try to secure a price closer to $1,200,000."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. While $1,100,000 is closer to my budget, I would like to propose a price of $950,000 for the product. This still allows for a reasonable profit for you while staying within my financial limits. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.

While $950,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to $1,100,000. I'll counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap."

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is a good deal. It's a significant improvement on John's offer, and it's likely that further negotiation will only result in a lower price. It's time to accept and move on."
