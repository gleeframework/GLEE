"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible opportunity. This product has the potential to revolutionize the industry and I'm confident you'll see its value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $2000000. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can't justify that price. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford at this time.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $2000000 is a bit steep for you, but $800000 is a significant discount from the value I know this product holds. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1400000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1400000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to pay $950000 for the product. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this opportunity.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're able to have a productive conversation. I'm willing to meet you at $1100000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I believe this price still reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll see its benefits. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
