"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This price reflects its value to me and provides us both with a fair deal. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,175,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000, and it's still a significant discount from the original price. What do you think?",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,175,000 is still slightly above my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my financial constraints. Let's aim to reach an agreement that benefits us both.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
