"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $18,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally good negotiating practice to start with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate down and still achieve a profitable outcome.
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $18,000, we aim to ""anchor"" Bob's perception of the product's value at a higher level. Even if he rejects this initial offer, it sets a reference point for subsequent negotiations.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $18,000 offer leaves significant room for negotiation between your minimum ($12,000) and Bob's perceived value ($8,000). 
* **John as Backup:** Remember, we always have the option to walk away and sell to John for $12,000 if negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm looking to stay within a tighter budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $12,000 matches our minimum acceptable price. While we started high hoping for more, accepting this offer guarantees we get our desired value and avoids the risks of further negotiation. 

It's always possible we could negotiate a slightly higher price, but there's also the risk Bob might lower his offer or we reach an impasse. Accepting now secures a good deal."
