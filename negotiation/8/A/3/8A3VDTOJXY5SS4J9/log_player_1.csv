Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. Here's why:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:** $1,000,000 is $200,000 more than your minimum selling price to John.
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value:**  $1,000,000 is still $200,000 less than what the product is worth to Bob, leaving room for him to feel like he's getting a good deal. 

This strategy balances your desire to maximize profit with the need to keep Bob interested in the deal."
