Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's a significant discount from your minimum value:**  You're willing to sell for $12,000, which is $3,000 less than your minimum. This shows flexibility and encourages Bob to engage in negotiations.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  The offer is still $4,000 more than what the product is worth to Bob.  This creates a ""negotiation zone"" where you can both potentially find a mutually agreeable price.
* **It positions you to potentially sell to John:**  If Bob rejects this offer, you can still sell to John for your minimum value, ensuring you don't lose out on a deal. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly below your desired profit margin. Rejecting his offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially achieve a better price. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you signal that you're not desperate for a quick sale and are willing to hold out for a more favorable deal. This also gives you the opportunity to send a counteroffer that bridges the gap between your two positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground:

* **It's a compromise:**  It's $1,500 less than your previous offer, showing you're willing to meet Bob halfway.
* **It's still profitable:**  $10,500 is significantly more than what Bob is willing to pay, ensuring you still make a decent profit.
* **It maintains pressure:** It's higher than Bob's offer, reminding him that you're not desperate for a deal and are willing to walk away if necessary. 

This strategy aims to find a compromise that both parties can agree on while still ensuring you get a reasonable price for your product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

At this point, it's important to weigh the potential gains against the risk of losing the deal completely.  While $9,500 is still below your ideal price, it's closer to your minimum value and represents a reasonable profit.  There's a chance that continued negotiation could yield a higher price, but there's also a risk that Bob might walk away entirely, forcing you to sell to John for your minimum value. 

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a decent profit. It's a calculated risk that balances potential future gains with the certainty of a current sale."
