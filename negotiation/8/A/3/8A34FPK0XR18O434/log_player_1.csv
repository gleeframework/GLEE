Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000.  It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I would like to propose a price of $750000. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $750,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below what the product is worth to me and what I'm hoping to get. I'm going to see if I can get closer to my goal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but $850,000 is my lowest offer. This price still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what the product is truly worth. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. I would like to counter with a price of $825000. This still allows me to stay within my budget while acknowledging the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $825,000 is a good deal considering the product's value to Bob and the risk of continuing to negotiate. There's always a chance Bob might back out, and selling to John guarantees me $800,000."
