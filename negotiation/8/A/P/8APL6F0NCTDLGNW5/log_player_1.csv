Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
```

This offer is a good starting point. It is above your minimum threshold, but still leaves room for negotiation with Bob, since he values the product at $1,500,000.  This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while leaving room for Bob to come to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below your minimum threshold, but it's still closer to your goal than selling to John.  Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, bridging the gap between your desired price and Bob's offer. It shows flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to your value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is still below your desired price, it's only slightly below the value John is offering.  Accepting Bob's offer secures a better price than selling to John and eliminates the risk of further negotiation rounds where Bob might decide to walk away entirely."
