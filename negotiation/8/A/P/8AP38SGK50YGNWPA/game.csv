"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $11,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway. How about $12,250? This would still be a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think.",12250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $12,250 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $11,800. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider this price?",11800.0,Bob,4,
