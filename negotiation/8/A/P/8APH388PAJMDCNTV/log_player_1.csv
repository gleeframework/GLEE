Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm thinking closer to $900,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. Let's find a middle ground - how about $1,150,000?"",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's valuable, Alice, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  Could we meet halfway at $1,025,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly willing to pay significantly more than our fallback price with John.  While $1,025,000 is a decent profit, we still have room to negotiate and aim for a price closer to our initial offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,025,000 is closer, but to be fair to the value of this product, I'd need to see it closer to $1,100,000.  This is a win-win for both of us - what do you say?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right this is getting closer.  To get this done, how about $1,060,000? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer and we're now at $1,060,000. While we could push for more, we're already well above John's offer and each round carries the risk of Bob reducing his offer or walking away.  Accepting at this point secures a strong profit."
