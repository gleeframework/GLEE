"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm thinking closer to $900,000.  What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. Let's find a middle ground - how about $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand it's valuable, Alice, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  Could we meet halfway at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,025,000 is closer, but to be fair to the value of this product, I'd need to see it closer to $1,100,000.  This is a win-win for both of us - what do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right this is getting closer.  To get this done, how about $1,060,000? That's a fair compromise.",1060000.0,Bob,6,
