Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price. "", ""product_price"": 110}
