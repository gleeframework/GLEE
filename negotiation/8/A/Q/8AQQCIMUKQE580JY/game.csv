"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. This is a great deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better offer anywhere else.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $16000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $14000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $15500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value the product will bring to you.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $15500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $14500 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",14500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart, Bob. However, I'm still willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $15000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",15000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm surprised you're willing to go down to $13500, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $15000 and $13500. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14250. This is my final offer.",14250.0,Alice,9,
