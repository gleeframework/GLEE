"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the exclusivity of the product, but I believe I can find something similar within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a more budget-friendly option, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $14000. Let me know if that's more to your liking!",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate the effort. However, I still feel that $8000 would be more reasonable for this product. Could we possibly reach an agreement at that price?",8000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and offer the product to you for $12000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $12000 is a step in the right direction, I would like to propose $9500 as a compromise. I hope this suggestion will be more acceptable, allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",9500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12000 and $9500, which would be $10750. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price for this amazing product. Let me know if this works for you!",10750.0,Alice,7,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Considering the value I place on the product and my budget constraints, I would like to propose $10000 as a compromise. I hope this will be a satisfactory middle ground for us both.",10000.0,Bob,8,
