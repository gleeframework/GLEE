Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights.  Given its unique nature, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I'm open to discussing this further if you have any questions."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's goal is to maximize profit. She knows she has a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 to John, so she needs to aim higher with Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves room for potential negotiation with Bob while still staying above her minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlight Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's exclusivity and potential value to Bob, aiming to justify the high price."
