Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, aiming high with Bob initially leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value and potential"" to justify the high price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By saying ""I believe this represents a fair deal,"" it implies Alice is open to discussing the price further if Bob pushes back.

**Strategy:**

This offer aims to find a balance:

* **Maximize Profit:**  Secure a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000).
* **Avoid Losing the Sale:**  The offer is high but not outrageous, acknowledging that pushing Bob too far will lead him to reject the deal."
