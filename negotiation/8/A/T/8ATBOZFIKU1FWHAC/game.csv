"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am unable to meet your asking price of $900,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850,000. This is the maximum amount I am willing to pay for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to $900,000.  How about $875,000? This is my final offer.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your persistence, Alice. While I understand your position, I am still not able to meet your latest offer of $875,000. I am willing to pay up to $850,000 for the product. However, if you could come down to $840,000, I believe we could reach an agreement. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're looking for.",840000.0,Bob,4,
