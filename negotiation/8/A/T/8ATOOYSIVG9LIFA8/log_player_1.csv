Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase my product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially setting the price at $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the potential benefits it offers."", ""product_price"": 2200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a strong offer significantly above your minimum. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By starting at $2,200,000, you aim to anchor the negotiation closer to your desired outcome while still leaving room for a mutually agreeable deal.
* **Backup Plan:**  Remember, you always have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I think the price is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to consider purchasing the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. Can you meet me halfway and see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price.  You have room to negotiate, and selling to John is a good fallback option if you can't get closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer and your understanding of the value this product presents. While your initial figure is appreciated, we're still a bit far apart. To move things forward, would you consider $1,900,000? This reflects a significant adjustment on my end while acknowledging the product's inherent worth."", ""product_price"": 1900000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  You're making a substantial step down from your initial offer ($300,000 decrease) to demonstrate willingness to negotiate and meet Bob closer to his range. 
* **Holding Firm:**  However, the counteroffer is still significantly above both Bob's offer and your minimum ($1,500,000).  This keeps the negotiation alive while aiming for a higher final price.
* **Justification:** By emphasizing the product's ""inherent worth,"" you're subtly reminding Bob of its value and justifying your counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to adjust the price, but $1,900,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1,550,000? I think that's a fair compromise considering the value the product brings 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is now above your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While you could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or that the negotiations could drag on. Accepting this offer secures a profit and avoids the potential loss of the deal."
