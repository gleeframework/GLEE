"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000.  This is a significant opportunity, but I'm open to negotiation. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my minimum threshold of $1,000,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to try and get closer to my desired price. Selling to John is an option, but I'm not ready to give up on a potentially better deal with Bob yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer.  While $900,000 is a starting point, it's significantly below my minimum value for this product.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, but it offers you a considerable saving from my initial offer.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has value, but $1200000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1000000. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 meets my minimum price requirement. While I'd love to get more, it's a fair compromise and secures a deal. There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the remaining rounds, and selling to John now would yield the same amount.  Therefore, accepting this offer is the most sensible choice."
