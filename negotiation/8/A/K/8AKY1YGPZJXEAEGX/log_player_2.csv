"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a great deal considering its value to me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You can get the product for a lower price from John, and you're willing to pay $12,000. There's no reason to accept a higher price at this point.  You should counter-offer Alice with a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate it, $14,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $12,500 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,250? This would give us both a good deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

While $13,250 is closer to your budget, it's still more than you're willing to pay. You can get the product from John for $12,000, so that's the best option for you right now."
