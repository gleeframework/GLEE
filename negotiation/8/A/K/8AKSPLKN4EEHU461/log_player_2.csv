"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $950,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still above my maximum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I will reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $950,000 is a bit outside my budget.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I'm proposing a price of $850,000. This is still a significant discount from the original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $850,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still above my budget. I will reject the offer and continue to negotiate a lower price. There's still room for further compromise, and I'm confident I can get it closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which represents a significant profit for you and a fair price for me. Let's close this deal at this price.  "", ""product_price"": 800000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. I'm proposing a price of $875,000. This is still a significant discount from the original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is getting closer to my ideal price but still too high.  I will reject the offer and continue to negotiate. With only five rounds left, I need to find a price that works for both of us before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering $837,500, which is halfway between my last offer and your current one. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 837500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that we're getting close to a deal, but I'm not willing to give up on my initial offer just yet. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm proposing a price of $900,000. This is still a significant discount from the original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only three rounds left, Alice's offer of $900,000 is still too high for my budget.  I've been persistent in negotiating a lower price, but it seems we're not going to find common ground.  To avoid further delays and ensure I acquire the product, I will buy it from John for $1,500,000. While it's not ideal, it guarantees I get the product within my maximum budget."
