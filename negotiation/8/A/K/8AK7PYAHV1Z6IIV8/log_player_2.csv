"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is better than $10,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price that's closer to Alice's value of $8,000.  Offering $8,500 is a significant reduction from the initial $9,500, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and hopefully pushing Alice to consider the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is only slightly better than her initial offer.  Bob can likely still get a better price by continuing to negotiate. There's still room to push for a lower price and save more money.  While $9,700 is closer to Bob's ideal, it's still worth trying for a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to meet Alice halfway.  Offering $9,000 shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a lower price. It's a more reasonable offer than the previous $8,500, and hopefully, Alice will be more receptive to it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,600 is now closer to Bob's target price.  While he would still prefer a lower price, continuing to negotiate risks going over the 10 rounds and having to pay John $10,000. Accepting the offer secures the product at a price that is still a significant saving compared to John."
