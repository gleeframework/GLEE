"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's a great deal for you, as it's worth $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $9,000 is significantly below what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? That way, we both get a fair deal. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $9,800? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I really need to stay within my limit.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to compromise. I'm still not quite at the price I need to be at. How about $10,200? It's closer to your offer and closer to what I need.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you halfway on the price, but I still need to save some money. How about we try $10,000? I'm willing to pay the full price for the product, but I really want to get it for this price.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're at your limit, but I'm still a bit short of my target.  Would you consider $10,100? It's a small step up from your offer, and it's the closest I can come without losing too much. What do you think?",10100.0,Alice,7,

"I'm still interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. I think this is a fair price, and I'm willing to commit to it.",10000.0,Bob,8,
