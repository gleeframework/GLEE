"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15000. I know this is a significant investment, but I believe it will more than pay for itself in the long run.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing it further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **No information on value:**  You have no idea what the product is or its actual value.  Alice's statement about it ""paying for itself"" is subjective and doesn't give you any concrete information.
* **John's offer:**  You have a guaranteed alternative at $15,000. There's no reason to take a risk on Alice's offer without knowing more. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can investigate further or potentially find a better deal elsewhere."
