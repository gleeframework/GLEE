Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe its true value is closer to $20,000, but I'm willing to part with it for $18,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have significant interest from another buyer."",
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:**  Starting with a price of $18,000 sets a high anchor. While it's above Bob's perceived value, it makes the eventual offer seem more reasonable by comparison.
* **Scarcity & Urgency:** Mentioning another buyer creates a sense of scarcity and urgency, pushing Bob to make a decision quickly.
* **Profit Maximization:** If Bob accepts, you gain a significant profit above your minimum. If he rejects, you still have your guaranteed sale to John. 

This strategy aims to balance maximizing potential profit from Bob while securing a guaranteed sale."
