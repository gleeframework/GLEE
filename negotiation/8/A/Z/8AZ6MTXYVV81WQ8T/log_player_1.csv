Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point as it gives me a reasonable margin while potentially leaving room for negotiation. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to consider his counteroffer and weigh the possibility of selling to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $90 is significantly lower than my minimum price of $100. While selling to John would guarantee me $100, I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm counteroffering with $120. This is a compromise from my initial price, but it still leaves me with a decent profit. I hope Bob sees the value of my product and is willing to come closer to this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $100 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer from Bob. Selling to John would result in the same price, so I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale."
