Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product which I believe is highly valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $14,000. This is a unique item that you won't easily find elsewhere."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies the product's value to encourage Bob to consider the price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring you get a profit above your minimum. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While you know Bob values the product at $12,000, he doesn't know your minimum price.  Your offer needs to seem reasonable within the context of the product's perceived value.
* **Potential Loss:** There's a risk that Bob will reject the offer, and you'll have to settle for $12,000 from John. However, the potential gain from a higher sale price to Bob makes this risk worth taking."
