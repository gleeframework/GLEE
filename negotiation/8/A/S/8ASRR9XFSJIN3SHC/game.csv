"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I've done my research and understand its worth to you is $1,500,000. However, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
