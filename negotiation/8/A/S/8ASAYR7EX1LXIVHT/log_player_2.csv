}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is significantly below its value. I could meet you halfway at $10,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

While closer to my budget, $10,000 is still more than I want to spend. I'll try countering one more time before considering John's offer."
