You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for $12,000 from John, so there's room for negotiation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. After careful consideration, I am willing to accept $13,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise given the value it holds for you.

``` 
Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he could potentially negotiate further, accepting $13,000 is still a better deal than buying from John for $12,000.  There's a good chance that continued negotiation might lead to a lower price, but there's also a risk that Alice will reject further offers and Bob will be left with no choice but to buy from John at a higher price."
