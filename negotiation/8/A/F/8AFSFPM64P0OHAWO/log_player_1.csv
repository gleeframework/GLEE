Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd like to offer $12,500. This would be a fair price for both of us, considering my budget and the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
