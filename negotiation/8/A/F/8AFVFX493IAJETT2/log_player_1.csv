Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $115 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round.  $115 is too low, and I can still get $100 from John if I need to."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $122.50? That way we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 122.50}

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```
