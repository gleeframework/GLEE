"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to lower the price to $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,4,
