Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed sale at $800,000, you have room to start high. This leaves space for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the product's value, you create a sense of desirability and urgency.
* **Alternative Option:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" subtly reminds Bob that he's not the only potential buyer, adding pressure to accept. 

**Important Note:**  This is a single-round negotiation strategy. If Bob rejects this offer, you would move on to John to secure the guaranteed $800,000."
