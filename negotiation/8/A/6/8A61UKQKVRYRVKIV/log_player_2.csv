It's time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  We've negotiated Alice down significantly. The difference between her current offer ($1,075,000) and our ideal price is getting smaller.  Further haggling might yield little gain.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:** Alice has indicated this is her final offer. Pushing further could make her walk away, forcing us to buy from John at a much higher price.
* **Saving Money:** Even at $1,075,000, we're still well below John's $1,500,000 price, representing a substantial saving."
