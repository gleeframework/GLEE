"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9500 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price.

"I understand that we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession to find a deal. I'll meet you at $8700. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",8700.0,Alice,5,
