**Reasoning:** Bob has progressively lowered his offer and reached his ""final offer"" of $1,700,000.  It's unlikely he'll significantly increase his bid from here. Accepting his offer means losing $100,000 compared to John's guaranteed offer.  It's time to cut losses and take the guaranteed deal."
