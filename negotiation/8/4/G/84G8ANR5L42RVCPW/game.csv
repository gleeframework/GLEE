"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider a price of $1,900,000.  This feels like a fair compromise. What do you think?",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm seeing a gap in our valuations. While I want to find a solution, I need to be mindful of the product's worth.  I'd be willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is my final offer, as I do have other interested parties.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
