Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a price that is still higher than Bob's perceived value, but it gives him some room to negotiate. I believe that Bob is likely to accept this offer, as he is still getting a good deal. However, if he rejects the offer, I'm prepared to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is better than Bob's initial perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $105. This is a compromise, as it's higher than Bob's offer of $95 but still below my initial asking price. I believe this is a fair price that both of us can agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm willing to walk away from this deal and sell the product to John for $120. This ensures I get my desired price and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
