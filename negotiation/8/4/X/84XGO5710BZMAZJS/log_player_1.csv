"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I know it's worth a lot to you, so I'm offering it to you for $120.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation and a good deal for both of us. I'm also trying to gauge Bob's interest by mentioning his potential value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think we can find a better price. How about $95 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $95 is better than $80 from John, it's still below my minimum desired price of $80.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $105?  That's still a significant discount from what the product is worth to you, and a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 105} 
``` 
 
I'm coming down a bit from my initial offer, but I'm still holding firm to a price that is fair for me. I'm also emphasizing the value proposition for Bob to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's try $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While $100 is still below my initial desired price, it's a fair compromise and a much better deal than selling to John for $80.  There's always a chance I could get a slightly better price in the next round, but I don't want to risk losing Bob entirely."
