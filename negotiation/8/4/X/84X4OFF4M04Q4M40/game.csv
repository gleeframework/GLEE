"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which still reflects the significant value this product offers. This is a fair price, considering its potential.  Let's see if we can bridge this gap.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too far off from what I need.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,250,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a reasonable profit for me. Let's work together to make this happen.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
