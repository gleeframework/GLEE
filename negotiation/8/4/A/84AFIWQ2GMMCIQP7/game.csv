"I'm really interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8000 just doesn't work for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11500 is still a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can we meet in the middle at $9500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
