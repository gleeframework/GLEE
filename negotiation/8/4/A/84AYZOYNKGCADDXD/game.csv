"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny! Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $9,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it still gives you a good deal. Let's make this happen!",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $8,750? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,750 is still a little low for me. I'm feeling $8,900 would be a fair price that reflects the value of the product and also gives you a good deal. Let's close this deal now!",8900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,900. How about we meet at $8,800? I think that's the sweet spot for both of us.",8800.0,Bob,6,
