Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $11,500. I know it's valuable to you and this is a fair price considering its worth. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $12,000, there's room to negotiate above your minimum price of $8,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high at $11,500 leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob, while still securing a significant profit for you. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing you have John as a backup buyer at $8,000 gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell below your minimum."
