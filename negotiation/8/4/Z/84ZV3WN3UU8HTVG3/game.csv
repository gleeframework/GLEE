"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I think $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,400,000. Can you consider this offer?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm open to finding a middle ground.  Would you be willing to consider $1,650,000?",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. However, $1,650,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,550,000. Can you meet me there?",1550000.0,Bob,4,
