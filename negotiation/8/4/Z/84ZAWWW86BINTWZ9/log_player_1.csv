Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly lower than what I'd get from John, but still significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, but also lets him know that I'm serious about getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for a price that's significantly less than what John is offering. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the first round, but I'm still holding firm on a price that's closer to my value than Bob's offer. This shows Bob I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not desperate to sell at a price that's unfair to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, the difference between his offer and what John is willing to pay is significant enough for me to take the guaranteed sale. I'm confident that I can secure a better price with John."
