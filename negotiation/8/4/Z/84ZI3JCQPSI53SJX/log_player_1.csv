Send your offer to Bob.","```json

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm only willing to pay $9,500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $9,500 is closer to my minimum, but I want to try to get more. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you're interested.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $10,000 for it. Let's split the difference. "", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,750? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to what I want, and I'm not sure I can get much more out of him. It's better to take the $9,750 now rather than risk getting a lower offer or having to sell to John for less."
