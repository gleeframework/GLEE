"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe will be very valuable to you. I'm starting with an offer of $11,000, what do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is a decent price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm only willing to pay $9,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  Bob is aiming to start the negotiation strong and establish a lower price point. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** While $9,500 is a good deal for Bob, it's still above Alice's value of $8,000. This leaves room for Alice to counter with a price that's acceptable to both parties.
* **Setting a Clear Boundary:** By stating a specific price, Bob is making it clear that he won't go higher at this point, forcing Alice to either accept or negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you're interested.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $10,000 for it. Let's split the difference.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Improvement:** While $10,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price. 
* **Negotiation is Ongoing:** Alice is showing flexibility, which means there's potential to negotiate further. 
* **Seeking a Better Deal:**  Bob can likely get closer to his goal of $9,500 with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,750? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 9750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Midpoint Compromise:** This counteroffer is exactly in the middle of Bob's previous offer of $9,500 and Alice's current offer of $10,000. It shows a genuine desire to reach an agreement.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes a ""fair compromise"" and expresses confidence in closing the deal, fostering a collaborative tone.
* **Staying Within Budget:**  $9,750 is still within Bob's budget, but it's a significant saving compared to Alice's previous offer."
