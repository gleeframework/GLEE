"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is a better deal than $1,200,000, Bob can likely do better. There are still 9 rounds left, and he can potentially get a lower price by negotiating with Alice or buying from John for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price. This aims to signal that Bob is serious about getting a good deal and is willing to negotiate.  He's also leaving some room for compromise, knowing that Alice likely won't accept this offer immediately.  This counteroffer sets the stage for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a better price than her first offer, it's still more expensive than buying from John.  There are still 7 rounds left to negotiate with Alice and potentially get a lower price. It's worth exploring if Bob can get closer to his target price before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering the same price John is offering. This is a strategic move. It shows Alice that Bob is serious about getting a good deal and that he is willing to walk away if he doesn't get it. It also puts the pressure on Alice to either accept Bob's offer or risk losing the sale entirely. 

Bob has a strong position here. If Alice rejects this offer, Bob can always buy from John for the same price. This gives Bob the upper hand in the negotiation and increases the likelihood of a successful deal at a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, but it's still higher than what John is offering.  There are only 5 rounds left, and there's no guarantee that Alice will lower her price further.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to take the guaranteed deal with John and avoid the risk of Alice continuing to negotiate higher."
