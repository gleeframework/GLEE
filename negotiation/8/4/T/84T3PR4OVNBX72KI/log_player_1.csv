Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $20,000.  Let me know if you're interested."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $15,000 gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell to Bob.
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating the product's value to Bob, the message implies it's worth the asking price by mentioning ""its value.""

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters or seems hesitant. You can always adjust your price downwards, but you can't go back up once an offer is made."
