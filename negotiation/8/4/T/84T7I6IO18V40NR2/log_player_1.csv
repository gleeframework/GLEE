"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer, but still leaving room for negotiation.  This leaves Bob with a significant profit potential while still giving me a good return on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is better than selling to John, I still believe I can get a better deal with Bob. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly but still aiming for a price closer to my initial target. This shows flexibility while maintaining a good margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round.  We are getting closer to a deal and I think with some more negotiation we can reach a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 890000} 
```

I'm moving closer to Bob's last offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. This leaves a bit more room for negotiation, but I'm getting closer to securing a sale without risking a deal with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial target price, Bob's offer is very close and it's getting risky to continue negotiating.  It's better to secure this sale than to risk a counteroffer that might not be better, or worse, losing the deal entirely.  This ensures a decent profit while minimizing the risk of losing out."
