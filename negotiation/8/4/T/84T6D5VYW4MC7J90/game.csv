"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at a special price of $230. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?",230.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $230 is way too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $60 for the product. Would that work for you?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand that $230 is a significant investment, and I want to find a price that works for both of us. While I can't go as low as $60, I'm willing to come down to $180. This product is truly worth it, and I believe you'll find it to be a valuable asset.",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While I believe this product could be valuable to me, $180 is still much higher than what I'm looking to spend.  Would you be willing to consider $70?",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but I'm afraid we're too far apart on price.  I can't let this go for anything less than $150. This is my final offer, and I think it's more than fair for the value you're getting. ",150.0,Alice,5,
