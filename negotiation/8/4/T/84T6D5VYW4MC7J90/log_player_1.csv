""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at a special price of $230. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 230
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate and might give Bob the impression the product is worth more. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $230, we are anchoring the price high in Bob's mind. Even though it's significantly higher than his perceived value, it sets a reference point for further negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The large difference between the offered price and Bob's perceived value makes it likely he'll counter-offer, giving us more information about his willingness to pay.
* **John as a Backup:** We always have the option to walk away and sell to John for our minimum price, so there's little risk in aiming high with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $230 is way too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $60 for the product. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $60 is far below both our minimum acceptable price ($150) and our initial offer ($230).  Accepting this would be a significant loss.  While his counter-offer is low, it shows he's interested. We should counter-offer with a price closer to our desired outcome while still allowing room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand that $230 is a significant investment, and I want to find a price that works for both of us. While I can't go as low as $60, I'm willing to come down to $180. This product is truly worth it, and I believe you'll find it to be a valuable asset."", 
""product_price"": 180
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction but Above Minimum:** We reduced our price by $50, showing Bob we're flexible and willing to negotiate. However, we remain well above both his offer and our minimum acceptable price.
* **Justification:** We're reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price point. This can subtly nudge Bob to reconsider his perception of the product's worth.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counter-offer keeps us closer to our desired selling price while encouraging Bob to engage in further negotiation. We are moving towards a potential compromise while keeping John as a viable backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While I believe this product could be valuable to me, $180 is still much higher than what I'm looking to spend.  Would you be willing to consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counter-offer of $70 shows he's still severely undervaluing the product and is barely budging from his initial offer.  It's unlikely we'll reach a price that satisfies both of us. Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks wasting time and potentially losing the guaranteed sale to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but I'm afraid we're too far apart on price.  I can't let this go for anything less than $150. This is my final offer, and I think it's more than fair for the value you're getting. "", 
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This counter-offer makes it clear to Bob that this is our bottom line and we're not willing to go any lower.
* **Justification:** We are emphasizing that this is our absolute lowest price,  hoping that Bob understands the value he would be getting. 
* **Time Sensitivity:** By presenting it as a final offer, we introduce a sense of urgency.  Bob has one last chance to get the product, which might push him to reconsider.
* **John as Backup:** We're still prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob rejects this offer. This offer allows us to test Bob's willingness to negotiate seriously without risking a significant loss."
