Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,300,000. Would you consider reducing the price to $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've considered your proposal, Alice. While I respect the value you place on the product, I need to stay within my budget. Could we agree on $1,250,000? This seems like a reasonable compromise.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,250,000 makes the most sense at this point. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:**  This price still yields a profit of $450,000 ($1,250,000 - $800,000).
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now means I have the money to invest or utilize elsewhere, as opposed to potentially drawn-out negotiations.
* **Risk Mitigation:** There's no guarantee Bob will go higher, and holding out for a small increase risks him walking away entirely. 

Therefore, accepting $1,250,000 secures a strong profit while minimizing risk and the time value of money."
