Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$150 price:** This is a starting point that's higher than your minimum but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Friendly message:** It establishes a positive tone and encourages Bob to consider the offer.

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  By starting with a price higher than your minimum, you create room for negotiation and potentially earn a better price. 
* **Testing the waters:** This offer allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potential willingness to pay. 
* **Leaving room for John:** If Bob rejects, you can still fall back on the guaranteed $120 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to find something within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price. There's no point in risking a counter-offer or going to John for the same amount. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimizing risk:**  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees you the minimum you're willing to accept.
* **No potential for better outcome:** There's no evidence Bob is willing to pay more. Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a higher price. 
* **Saving time:**  Accepting avoids further negotiation rounds and secures the sale."
