"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $500,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your position, the value of this product is far greater than $500,000.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,300,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. If that works for you, let me know.",700000.0,Bob,4,
