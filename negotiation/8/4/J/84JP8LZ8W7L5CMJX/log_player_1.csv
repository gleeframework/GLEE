Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This is a unique item, and I believe it would be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since we have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, we can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob. 
* **Potential for higher profit:**  Bob values the product at $800,000, but that doesn't mean he wouldn't be willing to pay more if he believes it's a fair deal.  A higher starting price leaves room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit margin.
* **Justification:** By framing the offer around the product's ""unique"" qualities and ""value,"" we aim to justify the high price without revealing our bottom line. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  We can always negotiate down if Bob rejects it. Having John as a backup buyer gives us leverage in this negotiation."
