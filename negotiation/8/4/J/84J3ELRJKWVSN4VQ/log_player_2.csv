Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Let me make you an offer of $135 for the product. This is my best offer considering the value it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $135 is now within my acceptable range. While I'd still prefer to pay less, it's a good compromise and saves me $15 compared to buying from John."
