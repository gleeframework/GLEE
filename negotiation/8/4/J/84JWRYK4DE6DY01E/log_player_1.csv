Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, I'm aiming for a more competitive price point. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price. I'm open to negotiation, but I'm looking for a price closer to $1,100,000. This reflects the value this product brings."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position on the value. To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000. This feels like a fair price that reflects the value while working within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly willing to go higher than $1,000,000. Accepting now would mean leaving money on the table.  We have time to negotiate further and aim closer to our original asking price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable figure.  To be fair to both of us, how about we meet halfway at $1,050,000? This recognizes the value while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close! I'm willing to move a bit from my previous offer.  Would you consider $1,025,000 to finalize the deal? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, and we are now above our minimum acceptable price. While we could try to push for more, there's a risk he might not go much higher. Accepting this offer secures a good profit and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether."
