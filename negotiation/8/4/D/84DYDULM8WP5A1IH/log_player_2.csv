Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're committed to your offer of $850,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell the product to you for $925,000, which is a 15% discount from my initial offer. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still a bit high. I'm not willing to pay that much, especially since I know I can get it for $800,000 from John. I'll try to counteroffer one last time before going to John."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, $900,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like to sell for. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I can sell the product to you for $950,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**
