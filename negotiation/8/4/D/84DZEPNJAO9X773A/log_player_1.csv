Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a good starting point because it's more than my minimum acceptable price but leaves room for negotiation.  I believe Bob will be willing to pay this, as he values the product at $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $950,000 is closer to my goal, I believe I can still get a better price. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm countering with $975,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing I'm willing to negotiate while still ensuring a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I was hoping to get a bit closer to my initial target, $960,000 is a good price, especially since Bob is unlikely to budge further. Selling to John would result in a significantly lower profit, so accepting this offer is the most logical decision."
