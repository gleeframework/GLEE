Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it gives me the best chance of securing a high price. I know the product is worth at least $800,000 to me, so I'm leaving room for negotiation. 

If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. I'm prepared to negotiate, but I'm also ready to walk away and accept John's offer if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is better than John's, but I'm not ready to settle yet. I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a lower offer, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $950,000.  This is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. It's a fair middle ground that hopefully encourages Bob to come closer to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $920,000 is very close to my desired price.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $950,000, it's a good deal that's significantly better than selling to John for $800,000. It's time to accept and close this deal."
