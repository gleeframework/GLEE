"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is less than what Bob would pay John, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. He's offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above what the product is worth to Alice. This is a strong opening counteroffer that allows for further negotiation while demonstrating Bob's willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is lower than John's price of $1,500,000 and only slightly higher than Bob's counteroffer.  It's a good deal for Bob, and there's a high chance further negotiation won't yield a better price.  Accepting the offer saves time and ensures Bob gets the product at a good price."
