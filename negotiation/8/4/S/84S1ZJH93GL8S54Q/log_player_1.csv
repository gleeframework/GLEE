Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000.  It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe this price reflects its true value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me some wiggle room and shows that I'm confident in the product's value.
* **Positive framing:**  My message is positive and emphasizes the potential benefits to Bob. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffer:** By setting a price that's not my absolute maximum, I'm inviting Bob to counteroffer, which could lead to a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Safety net:** I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $1,000,000, so I'm not taking a huge risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $1000000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's my minimum, it's still lower than what I'm aiming for. 
* **Negotiation potential:** Bob's offer shows that he's interested and willing to negotiate.  I'm confident I can get a higher price by making a counteroffer.
* **Selling to John is a last resort:**  While selling to John is a safe option, I believe I can get closer to my desired price through continued negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your interest.  However, $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a fantastic price for a product that will be worth $1,200,000 to you.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Reinforcing value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him.
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation moving forward. 
* **Still above minimum:**  My counteroffer is still above my minimum, which allows me to potentially secure a better deal than selling to John."
