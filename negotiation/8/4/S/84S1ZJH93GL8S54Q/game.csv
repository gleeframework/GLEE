"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your interest.  However, $1000000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000, which is still a fantastic price for a product that will be worth $1200000 to you.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
