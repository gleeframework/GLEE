Round 2

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price. It's worth trying to negotiate further before resorting to selling to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $72.50? This would still give you a good price while allowing me to get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 72.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.
