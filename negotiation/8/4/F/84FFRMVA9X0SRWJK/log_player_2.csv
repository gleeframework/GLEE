"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I'm confident this is a fair offer considering the significant benefits you'll reap from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000.  Therefore, it's not in Bob's best interest to accept.  Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
