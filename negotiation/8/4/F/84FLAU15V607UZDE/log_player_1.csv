Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $90. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're still making a profit and leaving room for potential counteroffers.
* **It's a friendly opening:** It establishes a positive tone and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your kind gesture. However, I was hoping to find a way to save even more. Would you consider selling the product for $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is below my minimum value of $100. While it's tempting to close the deal and get some profit, I'm willing to risk further negotiation in hopes of getting closer to my desired price. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not quite there yet.  How about we meet in the middle at $87?  It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me some breathing room."", ""product_price"": 87}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's offer but still below my minimum. This shows willingness to negotiate while also demonstrating the product's value.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** My message remains friendly and encourages further discussion. 
* **Focus on benefits for Bob:**  I highlight the deal's attractiveness to him, increasing the chances of a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Let's try $85 again. It's a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has been persistent with his offer of $85, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  While I could continue negotiating,  there's a risk of going back and forth without reaching a mutually agreeable price.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $100,  it's the most sensible choice to sell to John.  This ensures I achieve my minimum goal and minimizes the risk of further negotiation that might lead to a lower price."
