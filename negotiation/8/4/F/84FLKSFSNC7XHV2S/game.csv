"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  This reflects its value to me while still allowing for a fair profit for you.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is too low for me to consider. This product has significant potential, and I'm confident it can bring you a substantial return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,750,000 is still out of my range. I'm firm at $1,400,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while remaining within my budget. Let's see if we can make this work.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
