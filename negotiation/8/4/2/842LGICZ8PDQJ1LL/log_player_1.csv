"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love.  I'm asking $10,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can only afford to pay up to $8,000 for it. Would you consider lowering the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'll counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price. There's still room for negotiation, and I have 8 rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a fair deal considering the value of the product.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $9,000 is a bit out of my budget, I would like to propose $8,500 as a compromise. This would allow me to stay within my financial limits while still acquiring the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  While Bob's offer of $8,500 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm going to keep negotiating and see if I can get closer to my target price.  There are still six rounds left, so I have time to work on a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your compromise, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more to $9,500. This price is still fair considering the value of the product, and I think it's a deal that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've reviewed your latest offer of $9,500. While it's closer to my budget, I would like to propose $9,000 as a counteroffer. This would allow us to reach an agreement without exceeding my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While $9,000 is closer to my desired price, I've only got four rounds left. I'm running out of time, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price that's too low. John is a guaranteed buyer at my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  It's better to take the secure deal now and avoid potentially losing money with further negotiations."
