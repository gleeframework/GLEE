# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product would be a valuable asset for you, given its potential to generate significant returns. I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000. This price reflects its worth and provides you with a substantial advantage. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While $850,000 is a step closer, it still falls short of what I believe this product is worth. Given its potential and your clear interest, I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this opportunity. I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations.

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer again. While $950,000 is better than $1,000,000, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay.  He can continue to negotiate and potentially get a better price."
