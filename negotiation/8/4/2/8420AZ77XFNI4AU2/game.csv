"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to invest in this product at a lower price point. Given its current market value and my budget, I'd be willing to pay $850,000. This price reflects a fair deal for both of us, and it allows me to secure the investment while staying within my financial constraints. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While $850,000 is a step closer, it still falls short of what I believe this product is worth. Given its potential and your clear interest, I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this opportunity. I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit above my target price. Given the market dynamics and my budget, I'd be comfortable paying $900,000. This offer reflects a fair compromise for both of us and would allow me to move forward with the investment.  Let's see if we can find common ground at this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,
