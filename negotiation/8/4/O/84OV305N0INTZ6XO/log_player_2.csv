"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring significant value to your business. My initial offer for the product is $1100000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her actual value of the product, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $950000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. However, I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. My next offer is $1050000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and your initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but it's still above his budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate for a lower price.  There are still rounds remaining, and there's a chance Alice might come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still not quite there. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  This is my final offer, as I'm ready to purchase from John if we can't reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're close to making a decision, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1000000. That's still $200000 below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. My next offer is $1080000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $1,080,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.
* **Limited negotiation rounds:** We're only halfway through the negotiation process, but Alice has shown a stubbornness to budge significantly.
* **John's offer is secure:**  John is offering the product for exactly what Bob is willing to pay. 

Given these factors, it's the most logical choice to take the secure deal with John and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
