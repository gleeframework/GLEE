``` 

This is a good deal! While you could push for a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $1,550,000 makes sense for these reasons:

* **Exceeds your minimum:** It surpasses your $1,500,000 minimum.
* **Strong offer:** It demonstrates Bob's serious interest and willingness to meet you close to your asking price. 
* **Time value:**  Continuing negotiations has a cost, both in terms of time and potential risk. Accepting now secures a very good deal."
