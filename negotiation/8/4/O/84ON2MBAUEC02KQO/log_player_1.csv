{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation with a strong price, but still leaves room for compromise. By offering a price just below Bob's perceived value, I'm signaling that I'm open to negotiation while still aiming for a profit significantly higher than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, I'm not willing to settle just yet.  There's still room to negotiate a higher price, and I believe I can secure a better deal by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This price still leaves a good margin for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
