"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While it's lower than John's price, it's still above your target of saving as much money as possible. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** There's room for negotiation since Alice values the product at $800,000. 
* **Counteroffer:** A counteroffer gives you the chance to lower the price further."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This price still leaves a good margin for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:** $1,000,000 is less than your maximum of $1,200,000.
* **Significant Savings:**  You've already negotiated a $100,000 discount from Alice's initial offer.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a deadlock or Alice walking away, forcing you to buy from John at a higher price.

It's a good idea to accept the offer and secure the product at a decent price."
