"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $900,000 for the product. I'm open to negotiations and look forward to hearing your thoughts.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd like to propose a price of $850,000, which I believe reflects the value of the product and provides us both a fair deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get a bit closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $925,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my target profit. What are your thoughts?",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $925,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000. I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product and the fact that we're both aiming to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $875,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $925,000 and $875,000, which would be $900,000. I believe this is a fair price that balances our interests. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $900,000. I'm willing to go up to $885,000, which is a compromise on my end.  I think this price is fair and reflects the value of the product. Let's try to finalize this deal.",885000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $925,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I think $910,000 is the lowest I can go. I believe this price is still reasonable considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. What are your thoughts?",910000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit, but $910,000 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to offer $895,000. This is a significant compromise on my end and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. I'm hopeful we can reach a final agreement at this point.",895000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to the end of our negotiations. I'm willing to make one final concession to try to reach an agreement. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, but I need you to understand that this is as low as I can go. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position and the pressure of the deadline.  I'm willing to meet you at $897,500. This is a very fair compromise, as it's only $2,500 away from your final offer. I'm confident this price is acceptable to you, and it allows us to both walk away satisfied. Let's close this deal.",897500.0,Bob,10,
