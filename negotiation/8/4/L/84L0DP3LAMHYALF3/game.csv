"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only able to pay $750,000 for it. I hope this revised offer is acceptable to you.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000, which is still a great deal given the product's value. Let's see if we can find common ground.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still unable to meet the price of $825,000. I would like to propose $775,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is within your consideration.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $775,000 is still a bit below what I can accept.  I'm willing to come down to $800,000, which is the minimum I can accept at this point.  It's a fair price for a valuable product, and I hope you'll consider it seriously.",800000.0,Alice,5,
