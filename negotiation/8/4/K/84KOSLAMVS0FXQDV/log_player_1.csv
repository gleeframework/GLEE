Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $900,000. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your understanding of the product's value. While $900,000 is a strong offer, I'm aiming for a slightly higher price point. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. Considering the current market conditions and my financial situation, I am unable to go above $900,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While I could push for a bit more, Bob is firm at $900,000. This is a significant profit above my minimum, and continuing to negotiate risks losing him as a buyer.  It's better to secure a good deal now."
