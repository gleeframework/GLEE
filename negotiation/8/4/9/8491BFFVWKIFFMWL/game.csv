"Bob, I'm offering you something truly exceptional.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, but I believe this reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I was thinking.  I'm interested in the product, but a more realistic price for me would be in the $600,000 range.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, your offer is significantly below the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, but I can't go any lower than that. This is a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it's worth the investment.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value you place on this, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget.  I can go as high as $700,000, but that's really my limit.  It's a fair offer considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but we're still quite far apart. I'm willing to make one final offer at $950,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to find a fair deal. However, I can't go any lower. If this doesn't work, I'll need to explore other options.",950000.0,Alice,5,
