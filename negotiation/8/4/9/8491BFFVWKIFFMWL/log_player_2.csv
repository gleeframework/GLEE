Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but we're still quite far apart. I'm willing to make one final offer at $950,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to find a fair deal. However, I can't go any lower. If this doesn't work, I'll need to explore other options.

Alice is unlikely to come down significantly from her last offer. While you could try to negotiate further, you risk her accepting a different offer. John offers a sure thing at your desired price."
