"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,050,000. It's a one-time opportunity to acquire something truly valuable. I know it's worth $1,000,000 to you, and this offer allows you a slight premium for your convenience. If you decline, I have another buyer lined up who's willing to pay full market value.  Let me know your decision.",1050000.0,Alice,1,
