{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 175}

I'm starting with a price slightly above what the product is worth to me ($150) and hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $125. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $125 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $160, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 160}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
