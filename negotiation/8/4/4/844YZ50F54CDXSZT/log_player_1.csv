"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price to see if Bob is willing to negotiate. I know the product is worth at least $100 to me, and I'm hoping to get as close to that as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can still get a better price.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still trying to get as close to my minimum acceptable price as possible. I think $105 is a fair compromise, considering Bob's offer of $90."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get $100, it's getting late in the negotiation process, and I'm concerned that if I reject Bob's offer, he might walk away, or I might end up getting a worse price in subsequent rounds.  $95 is still a good price, and I'm happy with it."
