"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. I think it's a great value, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is at your maximum budget.** There's no immediate incentive to accept.
* **You want to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.**  Rejecting the offer allows you to try to get a lower price. 
* **John's offer is a safety net.** If the negotiation with Alice fails, you have an alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a significant counteroffer.**  A $2,000 drop is a big enough change to show Alice you're serious about negotiating.
* **Be polite and express interest.** This keeps the negotiation friendly and avoids making Alice feel pressured.
* **Leave room for negotiation.**  $10,000 is still a good price for you, and it gives Alice space to counter without feeling like she's giving away too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I think the product is truly worth more than $10000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11500. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is already moving closer to your desired price.** This shows she's willing to negotiate.
* **There's still room for improvement.** You can likely get a lower price with another counteroffer. 
* **John's offer is a safety net.** You're not in a desperate position to accept the offer immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $11,500 is closer, but I'm still aiming for $11,000.  It's the best I can do at this point. Let's see if we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continue to negotiate incrementally.** You're getting closer to Alice's price point, showing that you're serious.
* **Maintain a positive and assertive tone.** Emphasize that you're doing your best to make the deal work.
* **Set a clear target.** $11,000 is a reasonable compromise that is still within your budget.
* **Keep in mind your backup option with John.**  You have a safety net if negotiations fail."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get as close as possible to your target price. I'm willing to make another adjustment. I can offer it to you for $11250. It's a slight increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is now very close to your counteroffer.**  The difference is only $250.
* **You've already reached a good price.** $11,250 is significantly less than Alice's initial offer and within your budget.
* **Negotiation is likely to stall.** You've made several counteroffers, and Alice may not be willing to go lower.
* **Risk of losing the deal.**  Continuing to reject offers risks Alice becoming unwilling to negotiate further, or finding another buyer. 
* **John's offer is a safety net.** Even though you're accepting a price higher than $11,000, it's still within your comfort zone."
