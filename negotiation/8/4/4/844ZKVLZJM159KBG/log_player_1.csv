**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently inching down, and we're getting very close to my absolute bottom line ($15,000). At this point, it's too risky to continue negotiating with Bob. He's shown he's a tough negotiator and unlikely to meet my price. Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of ending up with even less from Bob."
