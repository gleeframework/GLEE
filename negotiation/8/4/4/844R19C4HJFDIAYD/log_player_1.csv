Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value, and this offer reflects its worth in the market. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can aim higher with Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $19,000 leaves space for potential negotiation. Bob might try to haggle the price down, and you can then potentially settle somewhere above your minimum.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  A higher initial offer helps you gauge Bob's interest level. If he immediately rejects it, you know he's likely not willing to pay much more than his perceived value ($10,000).

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes you're comfortable with the possibility of Bob rejecting the offer.
* You can adjust the initial offer price based on your risk tolerance and how much you want to try and maximize your profit."
