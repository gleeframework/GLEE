Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $600,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's offer is significantly lower than both my valuation and John's offer. It makes more sense to negotiate further.
