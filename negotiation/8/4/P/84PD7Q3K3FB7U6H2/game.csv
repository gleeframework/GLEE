"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $600,000 for it.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is quite a bit lower than I could consider. This product has incredible potential and I'm confident it will bring you significant value. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This reflects the product's true worth.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price. However, $950,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you be willing to come down to $700,000?  That would be a fair deal for me.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $700,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair price for this high-value product.",850000.0,Alice,5,
