Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I value highly. Given its potential, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair.  This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, aiming higher with Bob could yield a better return.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,350,000 leaves space for Bob to negotiate and potentially meet you somewhere in the middle, still above your minimum.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. You could explore other opening offers depending on your assessment of Bob's personality and negotiating style."
