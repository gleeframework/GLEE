"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $15,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, and it also reflects the product's value to me. I'll see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low. While I'd like to get the best price possible, I'm not willing to sell for less than $12,000.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,000. This is still a good price for me, and it's a bit closer to Bob's offer, which could make him more likely to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is slightly higher than his previous offer, it's still way below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counteroffer again in hopes that we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $11,000.  This is a significant drop, and I hope it signals my willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm not ready to settle yet. I believe I can get a slightly better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to offer $10,500. This is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to come down to a price closer to his last offer. We're only $500 apart now, so I'm hoping we can close the deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a stalemate. I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,500, and Bob seems unwilling to go any higher than $10,000.  With only a few rounds left, I'm not confident we'll reach an agreement.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000. It's not the best price, but it's a safe and guaranteed sale."
