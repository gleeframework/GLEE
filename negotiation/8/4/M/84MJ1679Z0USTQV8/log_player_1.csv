Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I know its value to you is significant. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a one-time, non-negotiable offer.  Let me know your decision."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can aim high with Bob.  
* **Anchoring:** Starting with a high offer of $1,500,000 sets the anchor point for the negotiation. Even if Bob rejects it, it makes your fallback price of $1,000,000 (to John) seem more reasonable.
* **Bob's Motivation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000,  meaning there's a potential for him to pay a premium if he perceives the product as scarce or highly valuable to his specific needs. 
* **Non-Negotiable:** By stating the offer is firm, you signal confidence and potentially save time in a back-and-forth negotiation. 

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob might reject the offer outright. However, the potential reward of securing a 50% profit margin justifies the risk in this scenario."
