"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $15,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to get as close to my minimum price of $12,000 as possible."", ""product_price"": 15000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is great, $15,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. However, $11,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you consider $9,500? I feel this represents a fair compromise and brings us closer to a deal.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500.

This is a compromise that gets me closer to my minimum price of $12,000, while still being reasonable for you. I hope we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10800}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
