# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I think it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm happy to offer it to you for $13,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $13,250. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,250 is still a little too high for me. I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price. Let's split the difference and go with $12,750. This would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12750}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to consider your latest offer. However, I'm still not willing to go below $13,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,750 and $13,500, which would be $13,125. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:**  Alice's offer of $13,125 is still significantly less than buying from John for $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Progress:**  There's been a clear trend of prices decreasing. While Bob could try for a lower price, the risk of Alice walking away or continuing to haggle for several more rounds increases.  
* **Time:** With only 5 rounds remaining, it's becoming more important to secure a deal.

Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price and avoids the risk of losing the deal completely."
