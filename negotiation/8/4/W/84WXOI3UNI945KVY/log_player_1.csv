Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to the right person. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $14,000 is higher than your minimum of $12,000, giving you some room to negotiate.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  Bob values the product at $15,000, so he has incentive to negotiate. 
* **It shows you're serious:**  By offering a specific price, you show you're ready to negotiate seriously.

Remember, if Bob rejects, you can adjust your offer based on his response, or simply move on to John.  Good luck!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less.  Would you be willing to do $13,000? I'm serious about purchasing this, and this is my best offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $13,000 is closer to your minimum, it's still below your ideal price.  You have room to negotiate further with Bob, as he's clearly interested.  Rejecting his offer allows you to propose a counteroffer that gets you closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down to $13,000, it shows you're serious.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13,500?  This would be a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
