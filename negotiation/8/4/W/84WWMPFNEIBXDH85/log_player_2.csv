"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe will be very beneficial to you. I'm asking for $14,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore better deals in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice. I'm interested, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000 for this product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting his negotiation by offering a significantly lower price than Alice's initial offer. This is a common tactic to establish a lower starting point for the negotiation. He also includes a friendly message to maintain a positive rapport with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for.  Could you meet me halfway at $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While $12,000 is better than John's offer, he can likely negotiate a better deal.  He should continue to bargain and see if he can get closer to his desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Would you consider $11,000? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to work towards his target price of $10,000. He's offering a price that is closer to Alice's offer, but still a significant improvement from her previous offer.  By maintaining a friendly and fair tone, he aims to keep the negotiation moving forward."
