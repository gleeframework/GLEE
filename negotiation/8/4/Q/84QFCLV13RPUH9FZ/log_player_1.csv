Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I see the potential in this product, your starting price is significantly higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it, which is my maximum budget. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to be flexible, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This reflects the true worth of what's being offered."", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you value this product highly, but $1,300,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a significant increase from my initial offer, showing my genuine interest. Let's see if we can find a compromise here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

While Bob is showing some willingness to negotiate, his offer is still significantly below my minimum. It's time to cut my losses and move on to the guaranteed sale with John."
