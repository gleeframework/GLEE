Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,000.  I believe it's a great deal and would be very valuable to you."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, trying to get a higher price from Bob first is advantageous. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $11,000 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value of $8,000. However, it leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a ""deal"" while still netting me a profit above my minimum.
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, I haven't lost anything and can confidently sell to John at my desired price."
