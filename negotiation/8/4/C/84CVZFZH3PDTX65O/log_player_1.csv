Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your lowest acceptable price.
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Potential Profit:** There's a potential profit margin of $300,000 if you can sell to Bob for a price between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

The key is to offer Bob a price that's attractive enough to accept while maximizing your profit.  You need to balance greed with the risk of losing him as a buyer.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available elsewhere.  Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have significant interest from other potential buyers."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity:**  Creates a sense of urgency and value.
* **Price Justification:** Avoids explicitly stating your minimum price, leaving room for future negotiation if needed.
* **Limited Time:**  Adds pressure for Bob to decide quickly.
* **Alternative Buyers:**  Subtly reminds Bob that you have other options if he declines.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start with a slightly higher price (e.g., $1,390,000) to allow room for concessions.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a positive long-term relationship with Bob is crucial, you might offer a slightly lower price to ensure a smooth deal.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while having a strong backup plan with John."
