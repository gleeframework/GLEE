"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob a chance to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. $11,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground.  He's offering a price that's closer to his maximum but still leaves some room for Alice to negotiate.  This counteroffer signals Bob's seriousness while demonstrating that he's willing to walk away if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $10,750? It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a good deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price. While $10,750 is still above his ideal, it's a reasonable compromise.  Given that there are only 7 rounds left and Alice might become less flexible in future rounds, accepting this offer is the best course of action for Bob.  He's saving $250 compared to buying from John."
