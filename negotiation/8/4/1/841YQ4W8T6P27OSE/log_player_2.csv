Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your confidence in the product, $1,500,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,100,000 is too low for what this product offers. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on the value of this product, but $1,350,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.
