Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, I believe $950,000 is quite high. Based on my research and budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $700,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $700,000 undervalues the product significantly.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, based on my current financial situation and market research, I am unable to meet a price higher than $750,000 for the product. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you.

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum threshold. Selling to John for $800,000 is the safest option to ensure I receive my minimum acceptable value."
