{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're getting more than your $8,000 floor.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** Bob still has room to negotiate and feels like he's getting a good deal.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:**  You can adjust the price if Bob counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down from your initial price.  However, I'm still looking to save as much as possible.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

While $9,000 is a decent price, you can likely get a bit more. By rejecting Bob's offer, you can counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to your initial offer of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is still a great deal for you, as you value the product at $12,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 9500}
