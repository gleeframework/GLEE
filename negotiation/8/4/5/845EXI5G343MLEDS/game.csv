"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial price.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford. How about $7,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $7,500 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to consider $8,200. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're really getting close!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be completely honest, I have a standing offer for $8,000 from another seller.  If you'd be willing to match that, I'll close the deal with you right now.",8000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you have another offer on the table, but I'm not willing to match it just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your new offer. How about $8,100? It's my final offer before I consider other options.",8100.0,Alice,7,
