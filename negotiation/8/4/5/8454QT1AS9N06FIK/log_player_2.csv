"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice claims the product's ""true value"" is higher, there's no way to verify that.  It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price. By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the information about the product's value. However, my budget for this type of item is a bit lower. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** A counteroffer of $9,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, showing Bob's seriousness in negotiating.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This counteroffer provides space for a compromise. It's likely that Alice will counter with a higher price, but it establishes a starting point for further discussion.
* **Staying Within Budget:**  $9,000 is still within Bob's budget, leaving him some flexibility if Alice's counteroffer is slightly higher."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10500. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

* **Significant Savings:**  Alice's offer of $10,500 represents a $1,500 saving compared to her original price and a $1,500 saving compared to John's offer. 
* **Compromise:**  Alice has shown willingness to negotiate, and this offer reflects a compromise. 
* **Remaining Within Budget:** The price is still within Bob's budget of $12,000.

While further negotiation might be possible, accepting this offer secures a good deal with a significant discount."
