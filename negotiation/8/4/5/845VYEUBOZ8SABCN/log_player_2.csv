"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. Considering its value and quality, I believe it's worth $100. Would you be interested in purchasing it at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $100, which is still more than Bob is willing to pay.
* **John's offer:** $120, which is Bob's maximum price.

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price. There are still 9 rounds left to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. However, I'm only able to offer $85 for the product right now. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  Alice's offer was $100, but Bob's maximum is $120. This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's price but still within Bob's budget. 
* **Compromise:** It's a fair compromise, potentially prompting Alice to negotiate further. 
* **Room for negotiation:** This offer leaves some room for Bob to increase his offer if necessary in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your situation and am willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $92 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $92, which is still higher than Bob's ideal price.
* **John's offer:** $120, which is Bob's maximum price.

While Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, $92 is still too high for Bob.  There's still room to try and bring the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $92 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to go up to $88.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 88}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer is a compromise, meeting Alice halfway from her last offer of $92 and Bob's previous offer of $85.
* **Reasonable price:** $88 is still within Bob's budget and represents a significant saving compared to John's offer of $120.
* **Urgency:** The message hints at a willingness to close the deal, potentially motivating Alice to accept."
