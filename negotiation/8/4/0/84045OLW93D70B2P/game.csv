"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  This is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us.  Let's finalize this sale.",10500.0,Alice,5,
