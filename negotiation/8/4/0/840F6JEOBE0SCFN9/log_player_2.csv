"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer you the product for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I believe this is a fair compromise and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $18,000 is significantly higher than his maximum budget of $12,000. He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering your value for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $16,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should still reject the offer. While it's lower than the previous offer, it's still above his budget. He should continue to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $16,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not comfortable going that high. I'm willing to pay $14,000, which is still above my maximum budget but represents a significant compromise from my initial offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this price."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to make a compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $15,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, the offer of $15,500 is still higher than his maximum budget of $12,000. There's no guarantee he can negotiate a lower price with Alice, and he risks wasting more time. Buying from John ensures he gets the product for his maximum budget and saves time in the negotiation."
