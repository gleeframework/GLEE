"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000} 
```

I'm starting high, at $18,000, knowing the product is worth $15,000 to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully secure a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm not willing to accept it.  I'll try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16500}
```

I'm going to counter with $16,500. This is still a good price for Bob, as it's below what he's willing to pay, and it's closer to my ideal selling price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is slightly better than before, it's still not ideal. I'm going to try to push for a higher price again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm going to lower my counteroffer slightly to $16,000. I want to show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We are at round 6 and Bob is still not willing to meet my price. It's getting close to the end of the negotiation and I'm not confident I can get a better price from Bob.  John is a safe bet for $15,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. It's time to sell to John."
