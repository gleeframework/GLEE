"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $22,000.  I'm confident you'll find this to be a fair price.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $22,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering the value to me.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is considerably below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $18,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the value of this product is truly significant.  Let's settle at $16,000 and close this deal.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $16,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $14,000. This is a significant compromise for me, and I hope you'll consider it.",14000.0,Bob,6,
