Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, considering my minimum acceptable price is $100. I'm hoping Bob values the product higher than that and is willing to pay more.  However, I'm also prepared to negotiate if he makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While I would like to sell the product, $90 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'm going to counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm counteroffering at $125. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this price is appealing enough to Bob, but still allows me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's only slightly above my minimum acceptable price, it's still better than selling to John for $100.  There's a chance I could negotiate a higher price, but I don't want to risk losing the sale completely."
