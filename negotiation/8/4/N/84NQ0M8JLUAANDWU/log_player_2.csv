"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. My asking price is $14,500. It's a great deal considering the value it brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is quite close to your maximum budget. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's asking price, but it leaves room for negotiation. It also gives you an idea of how much Alice is willing to budge.
* **Politeness:**  Maintaining a polite and respectful tone is important for a positive negotiation experience, even while aiming for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $11,000 is unfortunately below my minimum price.  I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $13,000?  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my minimum. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice moved significantly from her initial offer, showing some flexibility.  However, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting and countering, you demonstrate that you're aiming for a price closer to your initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Would you be willing to meet in the middle somewhere, perhaps around $12,000?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counter-offer aims for a price directly in between your last offer and Alice's current offer. It's a common negotiation tactic that can signal fairness. 
* **Testing the Waters:** Proposing $12,000, Alice's estimated value of the product, helps gauge how firm she is on her price and if there's room for further negotiation.
* **Maintaining Communication:**  The message continues to keep the tone positive and collaborative, encouraging Alice to continue the negotiation."
