"Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. My asking price is $14,500. It's a great deal considering the value it brings. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $11,000 is unfortunately below my minimum price.  I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $13,000?  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my minimum.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Would you be willing to meet in the middle somewhere, perhaps around $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
