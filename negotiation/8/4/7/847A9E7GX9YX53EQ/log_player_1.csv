Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for a product worth $15,000 to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $14,000 is a good starting point as it's close to my minimum price, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** Emphasizing the product's value to me helps Bob understand the potential deal.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message invites Bob to engage in conversation, making it less likely he'll immediately reject the offer.
* **Backup Plan:**  The knowledge that I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me confidence to hold firm if Bob makes a low counteroffer."
