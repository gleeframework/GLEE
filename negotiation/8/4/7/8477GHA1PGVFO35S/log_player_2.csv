"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to purchase this valuable product for a one-time price of $13,000. This is a rare chance to acquire something that is worth $15,000 to you, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

Alice's offer is a good deal, but you can likely do better. You're willing to pay up to $15,000, and Alice is likely willing to go lower since her minimum is $12,000. By rejecting the offer, you open the door for further negotiation."
