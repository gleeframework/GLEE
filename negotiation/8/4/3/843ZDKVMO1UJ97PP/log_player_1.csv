I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get more than my minimum desired price.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to negotiate down from this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm rejecting it and will counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm reducing my price to $1,300,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum desired price. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not desperate to sell."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is close enough to my minimum desired price of $1,200,000.  It's also a better deal than selling to John for $1,200,000.  I'm accepting Bob's offer."
