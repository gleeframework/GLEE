Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $130? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $110 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $125? That's still a great price for you, considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to get closer to my target price of $100, but I'll also consider the fact that I've already made a few offers and Alice has countered each time. I'll try to meet her halfway between $110 and $125, which is $117.50. However, I'll round it down to $117 to make it a more reasonable number.

{""message"": ""I'm still interested in the product, but I think $117 is a fair price for both of us. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?"", ""product_price"": 117}"
