Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available elsewhere.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it's worth a substantial investment. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to act quickly."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, trying to get a higher price from Bob first is advantageous.
* **Understanding Bob's Value:**  Knowing the product is worth $800,000 to Bob, I need to propose a price that's appealing to him but also profitable for me.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning a limited-time offer and other potential buyers encourages Bob to make a decision quickly.

By offering the product at $950,000, I leave room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value. If Bob rejects this offer, I can still confidently sell to John at my desired price."
