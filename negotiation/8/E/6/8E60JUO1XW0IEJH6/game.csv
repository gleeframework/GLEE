"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $12,000 at this point.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? It's a fantastic product, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford. I'm ready to close the deal at $12,500.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can finalize this quickly.",12500.0,Bob,4,
