"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it has even greater potential for you.  I'm starting with a price of $900,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $900,000 is above Bob's maximum budget. Therefore, it makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects the value this product holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $850,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his preferred price point.  Bob wants to save as much as possible, and there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer allows Bob to continue pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $800,000, which is the absolute maximum I can pay.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
