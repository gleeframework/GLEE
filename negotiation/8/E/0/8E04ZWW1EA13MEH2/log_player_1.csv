I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters, while still exceeding my minimum desired price of $12,000.  I'll see if Bob is willing to pay that much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not eager to sell at that price. I believe I can get more.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering at $13,500. This is still a decent profit for me, and hopefully, it's attractive enough for Bob to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob has come up a bit to $12,500. This is a good deal for me. I'm getting more than my minimum and don't want to risk going through another round of negotiation. I'll accept Bob's offer."
