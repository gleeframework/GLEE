Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, $1,800,000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in exploring a deal, but I'd need to see a price closer to the $900,000 range to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,500,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. To be frank, I'm targeting a price closer to $1,000,000. If you're able to get closer to that range, I think we could reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your willingness to negotiate is appreciated. However, the gap between our positions is still significant. I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000 for the product.  I believe this represents a fair compromise and a price that justifies the value I see in it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

``` 
 
While I could push for a higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is strategically sound at this point. Here's why:

* **Profitable Outcome:**  $1,100,000 is still a significant profit over my minimum acceptable price.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has consistently increased his offer, indicating a strong desire for the product. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now avoids potential delays and allows me to re-invest the capital sooner.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away.  

Accepting now secures a very good deal."
