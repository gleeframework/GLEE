"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing the details further.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, $1,800,000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in exploring a deal, but I'd need to see a price closer to the $900,000 range to make this work.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, but $900,000 is quite a way from what I can accept. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This feels like a fair compromise considering the product's potential for you.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,500,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. To be frank, I'm targeting a price closer to $1,000,000. If you're able to get closer to that range, I think we could reach a deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I recognize your budget considerations, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,300,000.  This is a significant move on my end, and I believe it reflects my commitment to making this deal happen.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, your willingness to negotiate is appreciated. However, the gap between our positions is still significant. I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000 for the product.  I believe this represents a fair compromise and a price that justifies the value I see in it.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
