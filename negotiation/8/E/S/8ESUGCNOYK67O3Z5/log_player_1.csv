"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a reasonable starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum desired value.  I'm confident that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob,  I'm not willing to accept a price that's lower than my minimum.  I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $125. This is a compromise that is closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I believe this offer shows my willingness to negotiate while still reflecting the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm running out of time, I still believe I can get a better price. $115 is still lower than my minimum, and I'm confident that Bob is willing to pay a little more. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm going to stick to my minimum price of $120.  Bob's counteroffers have been getting closer, and I believe he's starting to realize that $120 is a fair price. I'm willing to walk away if he rejects this offer, but I'm confident he'll accept."
