"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I think it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $11,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value and quality.",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the initial price, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I place on it, and it gives us both room to make a deal. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to negotiate the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,250. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and quality. I believe it's a good compromise that benefits both of us.",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,250 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to pay $10,750. This is a fair price that allows us both to close the deal.  Let's find a compromise that works for us both.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to negotiate further, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,750. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,100. This is a compromise that I believe is reasonable, considering the product's value and quality.",11100.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm trying to meet you halfway, but $11,100 is still a stretch for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,900, and I believe this is a fair price that's closer to our respective target prices. Let's make a deal that works for both of us!",10900.0,Bob,6,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,050 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,950, which is a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal. This is my final offer, as we're running out of time.  Let's make this happen!",10950.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're making a final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to accept $10,950. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,050. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted. I'm not willing to go any lower.",11050.0,Alice,9,
