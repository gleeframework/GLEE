Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,999. It's a fantastic deal on a product I know you'll find valuable."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to your product's value ($12,000) as possible.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000 gives you leverage.
* **Pricing Strategy:**  Offering the product slightly below your guaranteed price creates a sense of urgency and makes Bob feel like he's getting a good deal, even though it's just slightly less than what you'd get from John. 
* **Avoid Round Numbers:** Using an odd number like $11,999 can sometimes feel more appealing than a round number like $12,000.

**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob might try to negotiate. Be prepared to slightly lower your price if needed, but never go below $12,000 since you have a guaranteed buyer at that price."
