"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate the value it brings. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price of $1200000. I am willing to offer $950000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $950000 is a bit too low for me at this point. I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This reflects the significant value the product brings and leaves room for us both to benefit from this deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. I am still committed to finding a fair price for both of us. Based on my current budget and the value assessment, I am proposing an offer of $1000000 for the product.
