Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the benefits it will bring to your business. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($1,000,000) as possible without going below my minimum ($1,500,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate. Even if he counters, there's a good chance we can settle on a price that's significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Confident Presentation:** The message frames the offer as valuable and beneficial, potentially making Bob more receptive.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If I know Bob is a tough negotiator, I might start even higher.
* **Time Sensitivity:** If I need to sell quickly, I might be willing to accept a lower offer from Bob.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between getting the best possible price from Bob while ensuring I don't lose the sale altogether."
