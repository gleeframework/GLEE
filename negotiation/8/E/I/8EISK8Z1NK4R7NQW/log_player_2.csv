"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  I'm asking for $16,000 to start the negotiations.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $16,000 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $10,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $16,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** My initial counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but it's still above my absolute maximum.  This signals my serious intent to buy while showing I'm not afraid to negotiate.
* **Fairness:** $10,500 is a reasonable starting point, considering the product is worth $12,000 to Alice and $10,000 to me. This leaves room for compromise.
* **Clear Message:** The message emphasizes my willingness to negotiate and makes it clear that I'm interested in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $16,000 is closer to what I had in mind. Could you meet me halfway at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $13,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $10,500, but I believe there's still room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $13,000 is closer, I'm still a bit out of my comfort zone.  Let's split the difference at $11,500.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Alice halfway again, but staying within my budget. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message positive to encourage further negotiation.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:**  I'm emphasizing that finding a mutually acceptable price is important."
