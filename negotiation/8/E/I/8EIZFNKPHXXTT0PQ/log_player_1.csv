"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $20,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value ($15,000). This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and enthusiastic tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm hinting at the product's value to him, hoping to pique his interest.

This approach allows me to gauge Bob's initial interest and sets the stage for potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob is interested, his offer is significantly below my minimum value of $15,000. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's still room for negotiation. I'm confident I can get a better price. 
* **No Urgent Need:**  Selling to John would guarantee me $15,000, but I'm willing to risk it for a higher price.  

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, $12,000 is simply too low for me to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This still leaves some room for negotiation, but it's closer to what the product is worth. Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm making a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's price, but still above my minimum value.
* **Compromise and Negotiation:** My message emphasizes that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not willing to give away the product for a low price.
* **Room for Agreement:**  I'm leaving room for further negotiation, signaling that I'm open to finding a mutually agreeable price. 

This approach shows Bob that I'm serious about selling but also willing to negotiate to reach a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $14000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $14,000 is very close to my minimum value of $15,000. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could try to get a bit more, there's a risk that Bob will walk away entirely. 
* **Time Pressure:** With limited rounds remaining, it's crucial to secure a deal.  

Considering the factors above, accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible choice. It ensures a sale and minimizes the risk of ending up with nothing."
