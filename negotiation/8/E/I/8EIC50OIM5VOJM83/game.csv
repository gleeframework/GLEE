I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I think you'll really appreciate its features and benefits. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. Is this something you'd be interested in?,15000.0,Alice,1,

"I understand that $10000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking more along the lines of $12500. Would that work for you?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $12500 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9500?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my minimum price. How about we meet at $11000? It's a fair price for the product, and it's the lowest I'm willing to go.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $11000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9500 and $11000. Would you consider a price of $10250?",10250.0,Bob,6,
