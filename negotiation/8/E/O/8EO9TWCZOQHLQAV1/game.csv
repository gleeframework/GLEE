"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you highlighting the product's value. However, $150 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $100 for it, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. I am willing to meet you halfway at $125. This is my final offer before considering other options.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $100. It's a fair price for the product's value to me, and I believe it's in both our best interests to close the deal at this point.",100.0,Bob,4,
