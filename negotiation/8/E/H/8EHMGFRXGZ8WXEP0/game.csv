"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we split the difference and I pay $1,050,000? This would be a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this deal work.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to split the difference, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your latest offer. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
