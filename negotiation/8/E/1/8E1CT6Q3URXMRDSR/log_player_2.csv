(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $1,200,000 from Alice, but you are willing to pay up to $1,500,000. There's room for negotiation, so it's worth trying to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a low offer,  $1,000,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial price and leaves room for negotiation.  It's  a good starting point to gauge Alice's willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,400,000 is still higher than my ideal price, but it's closer to my maximum budget.  Rejecting allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,250,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

My goal is to get the product for as close to $1,200,000 as possible. By offering $1,250,000, I'm demonstrating my willingness to compromise while staying below my maximum budget. This counteroffer is also a reasonable middle ground between Alice's offer and my previous offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is only $150,000 higher than my ideal price of $1,200,000.  It's a good deal considering I have the option to buy from John for $1,500,000. Accepting this offer saves me $150,000 compared to buying from John."
