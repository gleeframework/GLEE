Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

It's time to get serious.  You've shown Alice you're willing to negotiate and are serious about buying the product.  Offering the same amount you offered last round shows you're firm in your price point but still open to a deal. This might pressure Alice into accepting, especially since you are running out of time. If she rejects again, you can always go to John."
