Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a bit below what Bob is willing to pay, giving him some room to negotiate. It's also above my minimum value, ensuring I don't lose out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $110 is a bit too low for me. How about $130? I'm confident this product will be worth it for you."", ""product_price"": 130} 
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $130. This is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $150, and it's above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $130 is closer, but I'm on a bit of a budget. How about we meet in the middle at $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $120 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer more, I don't want to risk losing the sale.  Accepting his offer ensures a quick and profitable transaction."
