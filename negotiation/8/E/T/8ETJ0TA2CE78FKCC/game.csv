"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it'll be worth more than that to you. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product is very interesting, but $18,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a fair price considering the value this product offers. Let's meet in the middle.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on $13,000. If you're willing to come down to that, we can make a deal. Otherwise, I might have to look elsewhere.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. How about $14,500? That's a significant drop from my previous offer and a fair price considering the value this product brings. I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my offer of $13,000. If you're serious about making a deal, I think this is the price point that works for both of us. Otherwise, I'll have to go with another option.",13000.0,Bob,6,
