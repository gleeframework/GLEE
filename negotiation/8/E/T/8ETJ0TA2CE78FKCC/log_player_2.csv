"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it'll be worth more than that to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $10,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to get a better price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is very interesting, but $18,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a fair price considering the value this product offers. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, $16,000 is still above my budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if she's willing to come down further before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on $13,000. If you're willing to come down to that, we can make a deal. Otherwise, I might have to look elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer. How about $14,500? That's a significant drop from my previous offer and a fair price considering the value this product brings. I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my budget, $14,500 is still above my maximum. I'm willing to take one more round to see if I can get a better price, but if she won't budge, I'll buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my offer of $13,000. If you're serious about making a deal, I think this is the price point that works for both of us. Otherwise, I'll have to go with another option."", ""product_price"": 13000}
