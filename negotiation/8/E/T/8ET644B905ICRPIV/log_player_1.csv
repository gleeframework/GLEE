Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $110. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for potential negotiation.
* **Above Bob's Value:** Offering it at $110 is still above Bob's perceived value ($80). However, the message emphasizes ""special price"" and ""value,"" subtly framing it as a potential bargain. 
* **Close to Your Guarantee:**  While we aim high, we don't want to scare Bob off completely.  This price is close enough to your guaranteed sale price with John ($120) that it minimizes potential losses.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  You make a profit of $110, which is a good outcome.
* **Bob Negotiates:** This opens the door for you to potentially meet in the middle, still above your minimum.
* **Bob Rejects:** You sell to John for $120, securing your minimum acceptable profit."
