"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13,500 is more than I'm willing to pay. I'd be happy to buy the product for $8,500. This is a fair price for both of us, as I'm sure you can find another buyer willing to pay more. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is significantly below its true value. I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,500. This is a fair price that allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's try to close this deal.",8500.0,Bob,4,
