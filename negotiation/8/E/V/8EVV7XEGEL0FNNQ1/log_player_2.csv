"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exclusive product. I believe it's a game-changer and will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $950000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far too high.  Your goal is to pay as little as possible, and $950,000 is well above your target of $800,000. Rejecting the offer allows you to start negotiating and hopefully get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $950,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product, recognizing its potential value. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a strong starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still shows you're interested in buying the product. It leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Alice's willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $750000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering the value you see in the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product for $850000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her offer, it's still above your target of $800,000. It's worth continuing to negotiate and seeing if you can get closer to your goal.  Since you have 10 rounds, there's still plenty of opportunity to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $750,000. It's a fair price that recognizes the value of the product, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintain your stance:** You've already made a counteroffer, and sticking to it shows you're serious about getting a good deal.
* **Reiterate the value:** Emphasize that your offer is fair and reflects the value of the product.
* **Show confidence:**  Express confidence that you can reach an agreement at this price. This can subtly pressure Alice to compromise further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're committed to your offer of $750000, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to reach a price that's closer to my minimum. I'm now offering the product for $825000. This is my final compromise, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer, but $825,000 is still above your target.  You have several rounds left, and there's still room for negotiation.  You're not in a rush, and rejecting the offer keeps the pressure on Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground.  While $825,000 is closer, it's still above what I can comfortably pay.  I'm willing to go to $800,000, which is a fair price for both of us and allows us to close the deal.  Let's finalize this and move forward."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show progress:** Acknowledge that you're seeing progress in the negotiation.
* **Final offer:**  This is a strong, clear signal that you're ready to close the deal at your target price.
* **Positive tone:**  Use language that emphasizes mutual benefit and moving forward.
* **Pressure:**  Alice has already lowered her price twice. This counteroffer puts the ball back in her court and encourages her to accept to avoid further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm surprised you're willing to meet me at $800000, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that's the best price for this product. I've made several concessions already, and I need to reach my minimum. I'm willing to go back and forth a bit more, but I need to be at $825000 or higher. I'm offering the product for $820000. This is my last concession, and I'm hoping we can meet at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unwilling to budge from her price, and you've reached your limit. You're only two rounds away from your last chance to close the deal, and you've already made a substantial offer.  While you're close to a deal with Alice, it's not guaranteed, and you risk losing the product entirely.  Buying from John ensures you get the product for your target price and avoids further risk."
