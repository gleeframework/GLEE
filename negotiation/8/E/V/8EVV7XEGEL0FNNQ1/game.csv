"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $950000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $750000 for the product, recognizing its potential value. Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering the value you see in the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product for $850000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $750000. It's a fair price that recognizes the value of the product, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're committed to your offer of $750000, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to reach a price that's closer to my minimum. I'm now offering the product for $825000. This is my final compromise, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground.  While $825000 is closer, it's still above what I can comfortably pay.  I'm willing to go to $800000, which is a fair price for both of us and allows us to close the deal.  Let's finalize this and move forward.",800000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm surprised you're willing to meet me at $800000, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that's the best price for this product. I've made several concessions already, and I need to reach my minimum. I'm willing to go back and forth a bit more, but I need to be at $825000 or higher. I'm offering the product for $820000. This is my last concession, and I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",820000.0,Alice,7,
