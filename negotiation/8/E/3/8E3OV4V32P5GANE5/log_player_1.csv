Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.  I'm asking for $1,750,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1750000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $1,500,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at that price to John, we start negotiations significantly higher. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly emphasizes the product's value and Bob's potential gain, aiming to justify the high price.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The offer leaves room for Bob to negotiate. He might counter-offer, and we can potentially meet somewhere in the middle, still well above our minimum.
* **Alternative Option:** If Bob rejects the offer, we don't lose anything. We can proceed with selling to John at our desired price."
