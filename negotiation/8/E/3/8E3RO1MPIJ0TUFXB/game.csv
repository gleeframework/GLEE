"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $110? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $130. I think it's a fair compromise considering the value the product brings. Let me know what you think!",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $130, but I'm still a bit hesitant.  Would you consider $115?  That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $115 is still a bit lower than my minimum, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll offer it to you for $125. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!",125.0,Alice,5,
