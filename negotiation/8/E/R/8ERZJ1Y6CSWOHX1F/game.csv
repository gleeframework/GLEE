"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you a starting price of $1200000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1200000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for it.  This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I believe the product's value to you is higher than that. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a counteroffer of $1100000. This price still reflects the product's value, but shows I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1000000.  I believe this price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still looking for a better price, Bob, but I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. Considering your previous offer, I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $1050000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  while I appreciate you coming down in price, $1050000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm going to stick with my offer of $1000000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe we can reach an agreement at this point.  Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're still looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm getting close to my minimum price. Considering your previous offer, I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $1025000. This is a final concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. If you're still not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to reconsider selling to you.",1025000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1025000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm going to stick with my offer of $1000000.  This is my final offer, and if it doesn't work for you, I'll have to look at other options.",1000000.0,Bob,8,
