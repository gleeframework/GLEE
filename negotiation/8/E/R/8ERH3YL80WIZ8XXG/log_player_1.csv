Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to find middle ground, but $1,825,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to go up to $1,750,000, but that's my final offer. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000.

While I could push for more, Bob seems firm on his price, and $1,750,000 is a significant profit. It's better to secure a deal now than risk him walking away and potentially getting a lower offer later."
