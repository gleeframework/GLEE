"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm happy to pay $100 for the product.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $135. This is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle and pay $120. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a good value for the product.",120.0,Bob,4,
