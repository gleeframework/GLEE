"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll appreciate its worth. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, but $650,000 is a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $900,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. How about we settle at $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",950000.0,Alice,5,
