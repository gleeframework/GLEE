"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:**  A friendly approach can encourage Bob to engage. 
* **Value proposition:**  Highlighting the product's value to Bob might make him more open to negotiation.

**Strategy:**

This initial offer sets a high starting point, but it's still within the range where Bob might be willing to negotiate. I'll be ready to adjust my price depending on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $11,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $11,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $15,000. Accepting would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation potential:**  There's still room to negotiate a price closer to my minimum. I'm confident I can achieve a better deal with further rounds.
* **Selling to John is an option:**  While $15,000 is a better outcome than Bob's offer, I'm not desperate to sell yet. 

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum, but still within a range where he might consider it. This approach keeps the negotiation active and gives me more control over the outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $11,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's a significant increase from Bob's offer but still lower than my initial offer.
* **Appealing to value:** I'm highlighting the deal as ""good"" for Bob,  making him feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Motivating factor:** I'm emphasizing the need for an agreement, hoping to encourage Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to find a compromise that balances my desire to maximize profit with the need to reach a deal quickly.  I'm confident that $14,000 is a reasonable price that Bob might consider, especially if he values the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. $14,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  How about $12,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $12,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.
* **Further negotiation:** I'm not yet desperate to sell and believe there's room for further negotiation to achieve a higher price.
* **John as a backup:** Selling to John for $15,000 is still a viable option, but I'm willing to risk a few more rounds with Bob.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, trying to push the price closer to my minimum. I want to see if I can secure a higher price than John's offer, but I'm prepared to sell to him if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is still significantly lower than what I need. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about we settle on $13,000?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying firm:** I'm sticking to my minimum price range while showing flexibility. $13,000 is a compromise, but it's still closer to my desired price.
* **Focusing on the compromise:** I'm emphasizing the ""fair compromise"" aspect, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Urgency:** I'm creating a sense of urgency by mentioning ""moving forward with the sale,"" suggesting I'm open to other offers.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a final attempt to nudge Bob closer to my desired price point. I'm hoping that the compromise and the suggestion of moving forward with the sale will encourage him to accept.  However, I'm also prepared to sell to John if Bob remains unwilling to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $13,000 is getting closer, but I'm aiming to keep it closer to $12,000.  Would you be willing to do $12,500?  That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $12,500 is still lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.
* **Negotiation potential:**  I'm confident I can still push for a higher price, especially since Bob has shown a willingness to increase his offer.
* **John's offer:**  While John's offer is attractive, I'm not desperate to sell yet and believe there's room for a better deal with Bob. 

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, trying to bridge the gap between our positions. I'll aim for a price that's closer to my minimum, but still within a range that Bob might consider acceptable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget limitations, but $12,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further. How about we meet at $13,500?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying firm, but flexible:** I'm sticking to my minimum price range while showing flexibility. $13,500 is a compromise, but it's still closer to my desired price and allows some wiggle room for negotiation.
* **Focusing on closing the deal:** I'm emphasizing the ""closing the deal"" aspect, hoping to appeal to Bob's desire to finalize the purchase.
* **Creating urgency:** I'm suggesting that this might be the final opportunity for a deal, hoping to encourage Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a calculated risk. I'm hoping that the compromise and the suggestion of closing the deal will push Bob to accept. However, I'm also prepared to sell to John if Bob remains unwilling to meet my price. I'm trying to strike a balance between maximizing my profit and getting a deal done before the limited rounds run out."
