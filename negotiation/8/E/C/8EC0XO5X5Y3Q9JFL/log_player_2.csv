It's time to cut bait and go with John.  Alice is very unlikely to come down to a price that makes sense for you. You've made it clear you're aiming for $12,000 or slightly above, and she's consistently rejecting offers in that range.  John offers a sure thing at your target price, so it's the best option to maximize your savings."
