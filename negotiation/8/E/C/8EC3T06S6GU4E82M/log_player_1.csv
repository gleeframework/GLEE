Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. It's a fantastic deal and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  We know Bob values the product at $10,000, giving us a starting point. 
* **Aiming High:** Starting with a price of $19,000 aims to maximize potential profit. While it's above Bob's perceived value, there's a chance he might be willing to negotiate down from a higher starting point.
* **Backup Plan:** The safety net of John's offer for $15,000 allows for a bold initial offer. If Bob rejects it, we can still secure our minimum acceptable price. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  The initial offer leaves room for negotiation.  Bob might counter-offer, and we can potentially settle on a price higher than $15,000.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes we have no information about Bob's negotiation style or how much he might be willing to pay above his perceived value."
