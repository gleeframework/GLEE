Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  while I recognize the value of this product, $1,300,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it.  I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value you've described.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is too low for me to consider. This product has significant intrinsic value that I'm confident will benefit you greatly.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still above my comfortable range.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This represents a significant investment for me and a fair price considering my budget.  I hope we can reach an agreement.

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable offer, it's clear that bridging the gap between his valuation and my minimum price ($1,000,000) will be difficult. John offers a guaranteed sale at my desired price, making it the most logical choice at this point."
