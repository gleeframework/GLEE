"Alice,  while I recognize the value of this product, $1,300,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it.  I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value you've described.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is too low for me to consider. This product has significant intrinsic value that I'm confident will benefit you greatly.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still above my comfortable range.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This represents a significant investment for me and a fair price considering my budget.  I hope we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
