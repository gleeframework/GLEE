"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I'm open to negotiation,  $7500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8250? It's still a great deal for a product worth $8000 to you.  Let me know what you think!",8250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8250 is still a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so how about $8000? I'd be happy to make a deal at this price.",8000.0,Bob,4,
