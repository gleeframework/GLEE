"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $250. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is way above your budget.  It makes sense to reject and start negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $250 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100 for it. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $180 for the product. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While $180 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above your budget. You have a better alternative with John. It makes sense to continue negotiating with Alice and see if you can get a better price, or else buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $180 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $150. This would be a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob! However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $150. I can do $170, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a great product, and I think it's worth more than that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is still above your maximum budget.  While you could continue negotiating, the risk of Alice not accepting your counteroffer and reaching the 10 round limit is high.  Buying from John guarantees you the product at your desired price."
