"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $250. What do you think?",250.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $250 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100 for it. Would you be willing to consider that?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $180 for the product. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $180 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $150. This would be a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know what you think.",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob! However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $150. I can do $170, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a great product, and I think it's worth more than that.",170.0,Alice,5,
