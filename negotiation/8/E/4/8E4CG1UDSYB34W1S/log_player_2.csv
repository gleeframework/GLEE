"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $11,000, which is a fair and competitive offer considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's opening offer is only $1,000 less than your maximum budget and significantly higher than her own valuation. There's a good chance we can negotiate a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious but Realistic:**  This counteroffer aims for a significant price reduction, closer to Alice's valuation. It leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Polite and Professional:** Maintaining a positive tone helps foster a good negotiating environment."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider $10,500, which is a significant concession from my initial offer. I believe this price is more in line with the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to her valuation, the price is still $500 above her own perceived value. We have room to negotiate further and try to meet closer to the middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we settle on $9,750? It's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 9750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer splits the difference between Alice's last offer ($10,500) and our previous counteroffer ($9,000). 
* **Strong Position:** We're still significantly below our maximum budget, giving us leverage.
* **Sense of Urgency:** As we progress through the rounds, reminding Alice of our alternative option (John's offer) can encourage her to accept a price closer to our target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $10,250, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is my final concession. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is signaling this is her final concession, and the price is now getting close to the point where buying from John makes more sense.  While we might be able to squeeze out a few hundred dollars more, it's getting riskier. Accepting at $10,250 secures a reasonable deal and avoids the risk of the negotiation failing."
