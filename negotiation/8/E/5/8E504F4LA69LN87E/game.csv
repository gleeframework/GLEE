"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to offer $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. It seems we're both serious about making a deal.  I could go up to $750,000.  That's a strong offer, and I think it's fair considering the market value.",750000.0,Bob,6,
