"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a better deal than Alice's initial value of $15,000, it's still above your maximum budget of $10,000.  You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  There's a good chance Alice will be willing to drop her price to secure a sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a low counteroffer of $9,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's offer of $12,000, but still higher than my maximum budget of $10,000. This allows some room for negotiation and hopefully pushes Alice towards a price I'm willing to pay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $11,000 is still above my maximum budget of $10,000. However, it's closer to my preferred price range. I'll reject the offer and make another counteroffer to try and get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $10,500. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate but still maintains some distance from my absolute maximum of $10,000.  It's a reasonable price point that might entice Alice to accept, considering she's already lowered her offer from $12,000 to $11,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is closer to my ideal price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my absolute maximum budget of $10,000.  At this point, the negotiation has gone back and forth a few times, and it seems like Alice might be unwilling to drop below $11,000.  To avoid the risk of further negotiations, I'll choose to buy the product from John for $10,000, which is within my budget and ensures I get the product."
