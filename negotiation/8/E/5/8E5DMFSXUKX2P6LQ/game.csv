"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value considering the product's worth to me is no less than $10000. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
