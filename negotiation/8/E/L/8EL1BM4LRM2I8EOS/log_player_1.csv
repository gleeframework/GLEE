Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this presents a fair and mutually beneficial opportunity."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close as possible to Bob's valuation ($1,500,000) while ensuring you're above your minimum ($1,200,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with a slightly lower offer than Bob's maximum valuation leaves room for him to counter-offer, potentially leading to an even higher sale price. 
* **Strong Alternative:**  You have a strong backup offer from John at $1,200,000, giving you leverage in the negotiation. Bob knows you have other options.

By offering the product at $1,400,000, you strike a balance between maximizing your potential profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
