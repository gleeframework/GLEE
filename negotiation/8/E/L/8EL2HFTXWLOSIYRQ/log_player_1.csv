"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire this unique product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,200,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) sets a strong anchor. This might encourage Bob to negotiate towards a higher price than he initially anticipated. 
* **Justification:** Providing a vague but positive reason for the price (""value and potential"") avoids revealing specific details while implying the price is justified.
* **Open for Negotiation:**  The tone is open for discussion and invites Bob's perspective, making it more likely he'll counter instead of walking away.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while leaving room for negotiation over the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need a price that makes sense for my budget. I'm willing to offer $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum and his own stated value. Rejecting outright is necessary to signal that his initial offer is unacceptable. You will aim to negotiate him closer to a million while remaining aware of your alternative option (selling to John)."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects the product's inherent worth while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Gradual Concession:**  Coming down by $300,000 demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to negotiate, but the decrease is not so drastic as to undermine your position.
* **Reiteration of Value:**  Re-emphasizing the product's ""true potential"" subtly reminds Bob of the value he'd be getting.
* **Strategic Positioning:** The counteroffer is still significantly above both your minimum and Bob's offer, leaving room for further negotiation while applying pressure for him to move upwards."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a big gap for me.  To be frank, I can get a similar product elsewhere for closer to a million.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000, but that's a firm limit for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below your minimum acceptable price.  More importantly, his statement about a ""firm limit"" and alternative options could be a negotiating tactic. You'll reject to test his resolve while moving closer to your own bottom line."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints.  However, getting a comparable product at that price point is unlikely given the unique value proposition this offers. I'm willing to consider a significant compromise at $1,600,000.  This is a substantial reduction on my part and reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging but Challenging:**  You directly address Bob's budget claim and alternative option, implying they might not be entirely accurate without directly contradicting him.
* **Significant Concession:** Dropping to $1,600,000 is a large step, signaling a willingness to make a deal but also setting a firm boundary close to your minimum. 
* **Framing:**  You emphasize this as a ""compromise"" and ""substantial reduction,"" highlighting the effort you're making to encourage Bob to reciprocate.

This counteroffer aims to:

1. **Test Bob's ""firm limit""**:  His response will reveal if he's truly unwilling to go higher or if there's room for further negotiation.
2. **Maintain Profitability:** While a significant drop, this price still ensures a substantial profit above your minimum.
3. **Keep John as Leverage:**  You're getting closer to your fallback option, so Bob needs to make a compelling move soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product is unique and valuable, but we're still quite far apart. I'm willing to stretch my budget to $1,100,000, but that's absolutely my limit. If that doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options, even though I'd prefer to work with you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are getting closer, but $1,100,000 is still  $400,000 below your minimum.  Bob is increasing his offer, indicating willingness to negotiate, but his language about ""absolute limit"" and ""exploring other options"" could be bluffing.  You'll reject to signal the seriousness of your position while proposing a counteroffer closer to your desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you stretching your budget and aligning it closer to the value of this product. To bridge the remaining gap and demonstrate my commitment to this deal, I'm willing to accept $1,400,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth while acknowledging your position."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** By stating this is your final offer, you create a sense of urgency and emphasize the need for Bob to make a decision.
* **Justified Concession:**  Coming down to $1,400,000 is a significant concession but still keeps you above your absolute minimum.
* **Balance of Power:** You acknowledge Bob's efforts but reiterate the value proposition. This keeps the negotiation from being solely about price and reminds him of what's at stake.

This approach aims to:

* **Elicit a Clear Response:** Bob must now decide if he's willing to meet your price or risk losing the deal entirely.
* **Maintain Profitability:** This price still yields a healthy profit.
* **Control the Negotiation:** You are now dictating the terms, putting pressure on Bob to make the next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we're getting closer.  I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a bit too rich for me. I can go up to $1,200,000.  I think that's a very fair offer, and it avoids me having to go with another seller.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting very close to your minimum price, but you still have two rounds left and a guaranteed offer from John. Bob is still using language that suggests he might walk away, but his consistent increases indicate he's very interested. You are only $200,000 apart, and by rejecting, you maintain a strong position to negotiate for a higher price, potentially reaching a point closer to your $1,400,000 offer in the previous round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're almost there. I appreciate you recognizing the value this product brings. To close this deal today, I'm willing to accept $1,300,000. This is my absolute final offer and reflects the significant concessions I've made to partner with you."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency and Finality:** By reiterating that this is your ""absolute final offer"" and emphasizing ""closing the deal today,"" you increase the pressure on Bob to accept. 
* **Meeting Halfway:** This offer splits the difference between your last offer ($1,400,000) and his last offer ($1,200,000), demonstrating fairness and a willingness to compromise while still securing a profit above your minimum.
* **Justification:** You subtly remind Bob of the concessions you've already made, implying that this offer is the best he'll get.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Secure a Favorable Agreement:** You're aiming for a price that is profitable while still palatable to Bob.
* **Avoid Stalemate:** With only one round remaining after this, you want to avoid pushing Bob too hard and risk him walking away. 
* **Maintain John as Leverage:**  While you're making a final push with Bob, you still have the option to fall back on John's offer if necessary."
