Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. My counteroffer is $1,137,500. I believe this price is a fair compromise and will allow us to finalize the deal.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum price.  I've made several counteroffers and shown a willingness to negotiate, but it seems she's not willing to drop to a price I'm comfortable with. To avoid further negotiation and potentially losing out on time, I'm going to purchase the product from John for $1,000,000. This ensures I get the product within my budget and avoids any further risk of not closing the deal."
