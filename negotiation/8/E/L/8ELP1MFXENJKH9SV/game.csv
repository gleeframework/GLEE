"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $1,200,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This price reflects the value I place on it, and I believe it's a fair starting point for further discussion.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. My counteroffer is $1,175,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product.",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm open to finding a middle ground, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too high. Let's try $1,100,000.  This price is a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. My counteroffer is $1,137,500. I believe this price is a fair compromise and will allow us to finalize the deal.",1137500.0,Alice,5,
