# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to buy your product, but $950,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time.  I'm ready to offer $700,000 for it.  This price is fair considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can make this work.
