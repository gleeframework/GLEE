"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to buy your product, but $950,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time.  I'm ready to offer $700,000 for it.  This price is fair considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can make this work.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I believe it's a good compromise.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",825000.0,Alice,5,
