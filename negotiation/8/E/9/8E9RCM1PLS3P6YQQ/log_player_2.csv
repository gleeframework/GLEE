"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still too high for Bob. While it's lower than John's price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  It's worth trying to get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to buy your product, but $950,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time.  I'm ready to offer $700,000 for it.  This price is fair considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 700000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I believe it's a good compromise.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but $850,000 is still too high. Bob can likely squeeze out a bit more by making another counteroffer.  It's worth trying to get closer to $700,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $825,000, which is within Bob's budget and a significant savings compared to John's price of $1,500,000. While Bob might be able to squeeze out a few more thousand dollars, the risk of Alice walking away or the negotiation going on for too long is not worth it. It's a good deal for Bob, and he should accept the offer."
