"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This would still be a good deal for you considering the value of the product, and it's a fair price for me. Let's find a middle ground to make this work.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $950,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm happy to find a solution, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to make a final compromise and offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is a price that reflects both the value of the product and our need to find a mutually agreeable solution.  I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
