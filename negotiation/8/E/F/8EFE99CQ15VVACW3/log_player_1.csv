Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $800,000 is below what I had in mind, I'm willing to negotiate.  How about we meet halfway and settle on $1,400,000?"",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the counter. $1,400,000 is still a little steep for me. I could go up to $1,000,000. That's the absolute highest I can go. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob has made it clear that $1,000,000 is his absolute highest offer. Accepting this would mean a $500,000 loss compared to John's offer.  While further negotiation is possible, it's unlikely Bob will significantly increase his offer. Selling to John guarantees the best possible outcome in this situation."
