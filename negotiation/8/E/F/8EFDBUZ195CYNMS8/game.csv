"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $20,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  How about we meet somewhere in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $17,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  Could we do $12,000? That's my maximum budget.",12000.0,Bob,4,
