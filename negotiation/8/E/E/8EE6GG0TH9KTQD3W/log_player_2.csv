Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I'm willing to work with you.  But $8,700 is just a little too low for me.  How about $9,000? It's a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer.  Let's split the difference again and go with $8,900.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice has indicated this is her final offer. While we could push for a slightly lower price, there's a good chance she'll refuse, and we'd end up paying John's $12,000 price. Accepting $8,900 secures a reasonable deal and avoids the risk of overpaying."
