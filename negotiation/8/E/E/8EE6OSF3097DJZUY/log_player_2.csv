"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product, which I believe is worth a significant investment.  Given its potential value to you, I'm proposing a price of $1400000.  Let's start our discussion there. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $1,400,000 is too high. You can potentially get the product for a lower price. There are 9 more rounds to negotiate and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. Considering the value I place on this product, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1200000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to stay above $1300000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's compromise at $1350000. This is a fair price that acknowledges your needs while ensuring I can achieve my goals. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is becoming more flexible, $1,350,000 is still too high. We're in the early rounds and there's room for further negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows us to continue to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit out of my range.  Given our previous discussions, I believe $1,250,000 is a fair price that reflects the value of this product for both of us. I'm hoping we can find a way to close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. Let's split the difference and agree on $1300000. This price is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product. It's my final offer before I consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still higher than I'm comfortable paying, but I don't want to buy from John yet. There are still several rounds left.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can get a lower price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your persistence, $1,300,000 is still too high for me. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial solution.  I'm willing to go up to $1,275,000.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1275000}
