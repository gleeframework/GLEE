"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product, which I believe is worth a significant investment.  Given its potential value to you, I'm proposing a price of $1400000.  Let's start our discussion there.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1400000 is still higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. Considering the value I place on this product, I'm willing to offer $1200000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1200000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to stay above $1300000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's compromise at $1350000. This is a fair price that acknowledges your needs while ensuring I can achieve my goals.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1350000 is still a bit out of my range.  Given our previous discussions, I believe $1250000 is a fair price that reflects the value of this product for both of us. I'm hoping we can find a way to close the deal at this price.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
