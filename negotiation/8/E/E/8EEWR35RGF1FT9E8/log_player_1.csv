"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $12,000 is significantly higher than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  $12,000 is less than Bob's perceived value of $15,000, so he has room to negotiate if he's interested. 

This strategy aims to start the negotiation at a good point, giving you room to adjust your price in subsequent rounds if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is above your minimum, it's still significantly lower than the $12,000 you initially offered. You have 8 more rounds to potentially get closer to your desired price, and rejecting this offer allows you to counter with a higher amount and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is tempting, I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This would still give you a great deal, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9800? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:** Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, but the price is still significantly below your initial offer and not far enough above your minimum. You have 6 rounds left, so there's room to push for a higher price.
* **Selling to John is a safety net:** If you fail to reach a better agreement with Bob, you can always sell to John for $8,000, so there's no immediate pressure to accept a low offer. 
* **Counteroffer strategy:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your initial $10,500, potentially leading to a quicker deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about $10,000? It's closer to your offer, and still allows me to make a decent profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9500? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to a deal:** While $9,500 is tempting, you're only 3 rounds away from selling to John for $8,000.  This means that you have a strong safety net, allowing you to be more aggressive in your negotiations.
* **Potential for a better offer:** Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, and you have 4 rounds left to try and push for a higher price closer to your desired range.
* **Negotiation strategy:** Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the pressure on him and shows that you're serious about getting a better deal. 

By rejecting this offer, you can potentially secure a better price in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing your commitment to this deal, and I'm willing to go a little lower. How about we settle on $9,700? That's a fair compromise, and we can finalize this sale."", ""product_price"": 9700}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Almost at a deal:** You're nearing the end of negotiations and have a safety net of $8,000 with John. This allows you to be more flexible with your pricing.
* **Meeting halfway:**  $9,700 is a midpoint between Bob's last offer and your previous one, demonstrating a willingness to compromise and potentially pushing Bob closer to your desired range.
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning finalizing the sale creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to accept your offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to go a little lower, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9200? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited time:** You only have two rounds left, and Bob has consistently offered prices below your desired range. It's unlikely that you'll be able to reach a better deal in the remaining time.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees you a profit of $8,000, which is still a significant amount and above your minimum. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing negotiations with Bob carries the risk of further rejection and ultimately losing out on a guaranteed sale with John.  

While it would be ideal to get closer to your initial goal, selling to John is the most sensible decision at this point, ensuring a safe and profitable outcome."
