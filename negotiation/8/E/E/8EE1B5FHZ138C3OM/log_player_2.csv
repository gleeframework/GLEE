Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $80 is your limit, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $80, which would be $85. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go lower than $85.  Since you can get the product for $80 from John, it makes more sense to take the sure thing and buy from John."
