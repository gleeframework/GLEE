"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $110 is within Bob's budget, it's not the best deal.  By rejecting, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to be reasonable while still saving money.  Offering $105 is a significant discount from Alice's original offer, but it's still within Bob's budget and leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your perspective, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price. How about we meet in the middle at 107.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much as possible.  While $107.50 is closer to his ideal price, he can likely get a better deal with continued negotiation.  He's also aware that buying from John is always an option if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $107.50 is still a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $106.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 106} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to be assertive in his negotiation, but also demonstrating flexibility. He's offering a price that's only a slight increase from his previous offer, making it clear that he's willing to compromise but still seeking a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob! However, I'm still not quite there. How about we try 108? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to get the product for as close to $105 as possible.  While $108 is closer than Alice's previous offer, it's still not ideal.  He'll keep negotiating to see if he can get a better price.  The option to buy from John for $120 remains a safety net, but Bob wants to see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, let's find a middle ground. How about $107? It's closer to your price and still within my budget."", ""product_price"": 107}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is demonstrating flexibility by offering a price in the middle of his previous offer ($106) and Alice's latest offer ($108). He emphasizes the mutual benefit of reaching a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close, Bob! But I'm still not willing to give up too much. How about we try 109? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, and he's only got a few rounds left. While $109 is still a bit higher than his ideal price, it's a better deal than buying from John for $120.  Bob decides to accept the offer and avoid the risk of losing the deal entirely."
