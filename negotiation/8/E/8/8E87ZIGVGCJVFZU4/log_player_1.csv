{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119.  I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible without going below my minimum ($120). 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $119 creates the perception of a deal while still ensuring I make a profit.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed sale at $120 from John gives me leverage to aim slightly higher with Bob."
