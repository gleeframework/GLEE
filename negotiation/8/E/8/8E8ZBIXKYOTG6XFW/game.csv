"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only able to go up to $1,250,000 at this time. This is still a great deal for you, as it's significantly above my maximum budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which still gives you a significant discount while allowing me to make a reasonable profit. Let's try to find a middle ground here.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a deal we can both be happy with. ",1300000.0,Bob,4,
