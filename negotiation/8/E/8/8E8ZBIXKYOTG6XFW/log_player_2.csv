"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further. While $1,400,000 is a good deal for Bob, it's still more than he wants to pay. A counteroffer could potentially get the price lower."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which still gives you a significant discount while allowing me to make a reasonable profit. Let's try to find a middle ground here.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $1,350,000 is closer to his ideal price, it's still more than he wants to pay. He can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
