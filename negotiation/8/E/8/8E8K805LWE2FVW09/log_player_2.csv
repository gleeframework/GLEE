Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really trying to get a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000 one more time, but that's as low as I can go. If you're willing to meet me at $9,000, I think we can make a deal.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice has firmly stated this is her final offer. It's unlikely she'll go lower, and continuing to negotiate risks missing out on the deal altogether. Accepting at $9,000 saves you a significant amount compared to John's offer."
