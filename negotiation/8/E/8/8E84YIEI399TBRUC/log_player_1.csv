"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'd love! I'm willing to let it go for $10,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than nothing, I still have 9 rounds to negotiate with Bob. I can likely get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is a good offer, but I'm hoping to get closer to my asking price.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,500?  That would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $9,500 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $9,200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,200 is getting close to my desired price, I still have 6 rounds to negotiate with Bob and can potentially get closer to $10,000.  Selling to John at this point would be a waste of those opportunities."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we settle on $9,300?  That's just a little bit closer to my original offer and would ensure a smooth transaction for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9300}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm sticking with my original counteroffer from round 2, which was $9,000. I'm willing to meet you at that price, but I don't think I can go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is sticking to his offer, I have 4 more rounds to negotiate. There's still a chance I can convince him to go higher, and $9,000 is still significantly more than my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you sticking to your offer, but $9,000 just doesn't quite work for me.  How about we try $9,100?  It's a small increase, but it would be a good compromise and would avoid us going back and forth any further."", ""product_price"": 9100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to get a good price, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $9,000. I'd like to reiterate that I'm willing to meet you at that price, but I think it's a fair and reasonable offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's getting late in the negotiation and Bob is stubbornly sticking to his price. I've only got 2 rounds left. While I could try to counter him again, it's not guaranteed he will budge, and I'm likely to lose out on getting a better price. Selling to John at $12,000 is the safest option to maximize my earnings at this point."
