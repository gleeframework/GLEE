"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'd love! I'm willing to let it go for $10,000.  What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is a good offer, but I'm hoping to get closer to my asking price.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,500?  That would be a fair compromise for both of us.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $9,500 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $9,200?",9200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we settle on $9,300?  That's just a little bit closer to my original offer and would ensure a smooth transaction for both of us.",9300.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm sticking with my original counteroffer from round 2, which was $9,000. I'm willing to meet you at that price, but I don't think I can go any higher.",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you sticking to your offer, but $9,000 just doesn't quite work for me.  How about we try $9,100?  It's a small increase, but it would be a good compromise and would avoid us going back and forth any further.",9100.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good price, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $9,000. I'd like to reiterate that I'm willing to meet you at that price, but I think it's a fair and reasonable offer.",9000.0,Bob,8,
