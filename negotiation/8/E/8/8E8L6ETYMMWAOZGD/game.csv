"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to negotiate the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1200000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and the initial offer I made. I believe this is a reasonable compromise.
