"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering me. While the product looks promising, I'm not comfortable with the price.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is still a very competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better deal elsewhere.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $750,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident that we can reach an agreement. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're willing to compromise, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $750,000. I'm willing to meet you at $825,000, which is still a good compromise considering the value of the product. I'm confident that this is a fair price, and I'm willing to wait for the right buyer.
