"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the product's high value and your interest, I am prepared to consider a price closer to my initial proposal. Therefore, I would like to counteroffer at $900,000 for the product. This still reflects the premium nature of the item while allowing for a more reasonable compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,
