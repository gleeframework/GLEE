"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $50,000 less from Alice than from John. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is willing to sell for $950,000, so a counteroffer of $900,000 is a reasonable starting point. It's a significant discount but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $920,000, which is only $20,000 more than your counteroffer. It's likely that further negotiation won't get you a significantly lower price, and you're already saving $80,000 compared to buying from John.  It's a good deal to accept."
