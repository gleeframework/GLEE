# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer

While $14,000 is less than your maximum budget, Alice is clearly trying to push the price higher than she values the product (she values it at $12,000). There's a good chance you could get a better price by rejecting this offer and seeing if she's willing to come down further."
