Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to save some money on this deal. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

I want to try and get a higher price, so I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,500,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $1,625,000? This still leaves room for both of us to benefit from the transaction."", ""product_price"": 1625000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still looking to save some more. I'm willing to pay $1,550,000 for the product. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is still a good deal for me. It's above my minimum threshold, and with the limited rounds, I don't want to risk losing him as a buyer and having to settle for John's $1,500,000 offer."
