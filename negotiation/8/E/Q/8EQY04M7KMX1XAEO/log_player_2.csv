Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

Alice is coming down in price.  At $825,000, this is a good deal for you.  You're getting a product worth $1,200,000 to you for less than $1 million.  Accepting her offer saves you a lot of money compared to buying from John."
