"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value, but not too far away. This allows room for negotiation while also signaling that I'm serious about getting a good price.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message positive and friendly to build rapport and encourage Bob to negotiate.
* **Reasoning:** Providing a reason for the price helps justify the offer and encourages Bob to consider it. 

**Important Note:** I'm keeping the option to sell to John open at all times. If the negotiations with Bob stall or become unreasonable, I'll switch to John for the guaranteed $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $9,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.**  While it's closer to my desired outcome, I need to get at least $12,000 to make this worthwhile. 
* **I want to see if I can push Bob higher.** I'm confident that I can convince him to increase his offer, especially since I have the option to sell to John for a significantly higher price. 

I'll proceed to the next round and counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $9,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This would still be a good deal for you, considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm demonstrating willingness to compromise by lowering my price, but still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Appeal to Logic:** I'm using logical reasoning by offering a middle ground and emphasizing the product's value to Bob.
* **Maintaining Optimism:**  I'm keeping the message positive and encouraging Bob to consider my offer. 

**Important Note:** I'm still aware of the option to sell to John. If Bob continues to be unreasonable, I'll switch to John to guarantee my desired profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand your position, but I would like to propose a price of $10,000 for your product. I hope this meets somewhere in between our expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my target:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below the $10,500 I proposed in the previous round.
* **Continuing negotiation:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can push Bob to increase his offer a bit more.
* **Minimizing risk:**  I'm avoiding the risk of accepting a price that's still below my desired minimum. 

I'll continue negotiating with Bob, but I'll keep John in mind as a backup option if negotiations stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  I'm still feeling a bit off on $10,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? That way we both get a bit closer to what we're looking for."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Compromise:** I'm making a very small compromise by lowering my offer slightly from $10,500. This shows flexibility and willingness to meet halfway.
* **Maintaining the Middle Ground:** I'm keeping the focus on finding a middle ground between our desired prices, making it seem like a fair and logical solution.
* **Encouraging a Quick Deal:**  I'm aiming for a quick resolution, hoping Bob will accept this offer and avoid further negotiations.

**Important Note:** I'm still prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob continues to be unreasonable. I'm getting closer to my desired price, but I'm not willing to compromise too much further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a fair price. I would like to propose a price of $10,000 for your product. I hope this helps move us closer to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob has not budged from his $10,000 offer despite my efforts to reach a compromise.
* **Time is Running Out:** We're nearing the halfway point of the negotiations, and I'm getting increasingly concerned about wasting valuable time.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my desired $15,000 profit.

I've been patient and tried to find a mutually agreeable price with Bob, but it's clear we're at an impasse.  It's time to take the guaranteed option and sell to John."
