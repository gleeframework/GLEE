"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $9,500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your offer, $7,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a very competitive price for a product you'll gain so much from.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, I'm afraid $9,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I could do $7,500.  That's a fair offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $8,500? This is my final offer.",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting close. I understand this is your final offer, but it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  I could meet you at $8,200.  That's the best I can do.",8200.0,Bob,6,
