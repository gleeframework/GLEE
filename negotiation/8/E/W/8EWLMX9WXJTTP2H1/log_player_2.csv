"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high.  It's much closer to my maximum than hers. I should try to negotiate it down significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?"", 
""product_price"": 7000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your offer, $7,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a very competitive price for a product you'll gain so much from. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice came down $500, but that's still not enough of a concession. I need to show her I'm willing to walk away if necessary to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, I'm afraid $9,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I could do $7,500.  That's a fair offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $8,500? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is a tough one. Alice is saying this is her final offer, and $8,500 is getting close to a price I might accept.  However, I still think there's a chance I can get it lower, even if it means risking the deal.  I'll try one more time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're right, we're getting close. I understand this is your final offer, but it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  I could meet you at $8,200.  That's the best I can do."",
""product_price"": 8200
}
