Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close.  $14,000 is almost there, but I need to make a little more than that to make it worthwhile.  How about $14,250? This is my final offer, I can't go any lower.

Alice has signaled this is her final offer, and while it's slightly above your target price, it's a reasonable deal compared to John's price. Accepting now avoids the risk of the deal falling through."
