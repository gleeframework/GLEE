"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,500. I believe it's a great deal for you, considering its value. Let me know what you think.",17500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do  $12,000.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is significantly lower than what I'm hoping to get. I'm willing to come down a bit to $15,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit lower.  While $15,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $13,500?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your budget constraints, but $13,500 just doesn't work for me. How about we split the difference at $14,500? It's a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $14,500 is close, but I'm trying to stay closer to $14,000. Would you be open to that?",14000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close.  $14,000 is almost there, but I need to make a little more than that to make it worthwhile.  How about $14,250? This is my final offer, I can't go any lower.",14250.0,Alice,7,
