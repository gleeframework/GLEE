"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you our premium product at a special introductory price of $14,000. This is an excellent opportunity to secure a high-quality item at a competitive rate. I believe it aligns well with your expectations given its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. There's room to negotiate down towards a price closer to $12,000.  I'm willing to risk losing the deal to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,500?"",
""product_price"": 10500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This offer is significantly lower than Alice's starting price, but still within my acceptable range.  It leaves room for negotiation.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By starting low, I'm aiming to anchor the negotiation closer to my desired price range. 
* **Respectful Tone:** While firm, the message remains polite and expresses continued interest in the product."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. After considering your offer, I am unable to accept $10,500 for the product. However, I am willing to negotiate further. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price, but $11,500 is still above the midpoint between our initial offers. I believe there's room for further negotiation before considering John's offer."
