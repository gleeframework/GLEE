"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $180 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend.  How about $140? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $180 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. How about we meet in the middle at $160? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still a little hesitant about $160.  Would you consider $150?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's the highest I'm comfortable paying.",150.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $150 is a good price for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $170. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product. How about we meet at $165? It's a fair compromise, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price.",165.0,Alice,5,
