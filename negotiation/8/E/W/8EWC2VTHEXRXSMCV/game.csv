"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you thinking of me, but $18,000 is well above my budget. I'm happy to pay $12,000 for the product, as it's worth that much to me. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? This is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15,000 is still too much for me. I'm sticking to my offer of $12,000. I understand this is a valuable product, but it's important for me to stay within my budget.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on this deal. How about we meet at $14,000? This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your concerns, and I'm happy to meet you halfway. $13,000 is my final offer.  It's still within my budget, and it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",13000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $13,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about what's fair for me. Let's meet at $14,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",14500.0,Alice,7,
