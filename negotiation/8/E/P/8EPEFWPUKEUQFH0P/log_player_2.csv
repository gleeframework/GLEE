"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you a great deal on this fantastic product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer of $150 is significantly higher than both your maximum budget of $100 and John's offer of $100. Buying from John is the most financially sensible option in this scenario."
