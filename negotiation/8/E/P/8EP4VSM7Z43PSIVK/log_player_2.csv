"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is better than $10,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. However, I'm only able to go as high as $9,000 right now. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is still a little lower than what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:**  Bob values the product at $10,000. 
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice is now offering the product for $9,250.
* **John's Offer:** John is offering the product for $10,000.

At this point, accepting Alice's offer is the best choice:

* It's cheaper than John's offer.
* It's a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $10,000.

While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject his counteroffer and he might end up paying John's higher price.  It's more advantageous to accept Alice's current offer."
