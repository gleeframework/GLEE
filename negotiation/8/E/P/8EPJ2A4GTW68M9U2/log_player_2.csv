"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be interested in. It's worth at least $80 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for a little less.  Would you be interested in purchasing it for $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I'll reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $80 to Alice, so she should be willing to sell it for $80 or less. Buying it from her for $85 would be a bad deal for me. I'll reject her offer and buy it from John for $80 instead.
