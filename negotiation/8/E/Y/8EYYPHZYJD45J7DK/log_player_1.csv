"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,200,000. This is a bold move, but I'm confident that the product is worth this much to Bob. I'm hoping to secure a good profit in the first round. If Bob rejects, I'll have to reassess and see how far I'm willing to go down in price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is still a good amount, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet. I believe I can get a better deal. I'll counteroffer Bob to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm counteroffering Bob at $1,050,000. This is a compromise, but I'm still aiming for a profit.  I believe this price is fair, considering the product's worth to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'm going to counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000,000. This is my bottom line, as this is the amount John is willing to pay. If Bob rejects, I'll sell to John and secure a guaranteed profit."
