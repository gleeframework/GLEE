"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I understand your position and I'm glad we're able to continue this discussion. Based on our previous negotiations, I am willing to offer the product at $880,000. This price reflects a reasonable compromise that maximizes the value for both parties.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, her offer of $880,000 is still above your maximum budget of $800,000. It's tempting to keep negotiating, but at this point, it's likely that the price will not go lower. It's a better choice to secure the product from John at $800,000, ensuring you stay within your budget and get the best possible deal."
