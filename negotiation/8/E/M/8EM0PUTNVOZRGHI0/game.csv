"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $8,000. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your budget constraints, $8,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000? I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16,000 is still out of my price range. I'm really serious about buying this product, but I can't go above $10,000.  It's the absolute maximum I can afford. Let's see if we can make this work.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but the value of this product is substantial. Let's settle at $13,000. This is my final offer, as I do have other potential buyers.",13000.0,Alice,5,
