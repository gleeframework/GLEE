"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible. However, I'm really looking to stay within my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,500?  I believe that's a fair price that would make this a win-win for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  Would you consider meeting halfway at $11,000? It's a competitive price for a product of this value.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still trying to find a way to make this work within my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal without further delays.",10750.0,Bob,4,
