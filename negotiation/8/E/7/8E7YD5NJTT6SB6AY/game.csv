"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $1,200,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and potential. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,600,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our prices, so I'm offering $1,400,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession to reach a deal. How about $1,450,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the time we've invested in negotiating. Let me know if you're interested.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
