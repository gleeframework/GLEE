"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1100000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to get a better deal.  You can counteroffer at a lower price, potentially saving even more than $100,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $950,000. This price is still within your desired range and would be a great deal for me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $950000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $1000000. This price still represents a great value for you and allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Alice's offer is now the same as John's price, so there's no further advantage to negotiating. Accepting Alice's offer is the best choice, as it saves the hassle of further negotiation."
