"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exclusive product, which I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000, a price that I think is a fair compromise considering the benefits it will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is lower than the $15,000 you would pay John.  Therefore, accepting Alice's offer saves you $3,000."
