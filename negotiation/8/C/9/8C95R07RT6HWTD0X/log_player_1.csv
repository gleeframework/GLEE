Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $14,000 is higher than your minimum of $12,000, ensuring you make a profit. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  The offer is below Bob's maximum value of $15,000, giving him room to counter and potentially reach a price that works for both of you. 
* **It shows confidence:**  You're not starting too low, which signals that you believe your product is worth the asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,000 is above your absolute minimum, it's still a significant drop from your initial offer and below what you're likely hoping for.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to counter with a higher price and potentially get closer to your desired selling point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $13,000? That's still a good deal for you considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to find a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 is your minimum price and ensures you make a profit.  While you could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely that Bob will go higher, and you risk losing the sale entirely.  Accepting his offer ensures you close the deal and get your minimum price."
