Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a higher price.  I'm willing to go lower than my initial offer, but I want to see if I can get closer to my desired value."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $11000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I respect that.  However, $11,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, and I'm offering $13,000.  This is a fair price, and I believe it's a great deal for you.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 13000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable here, but $11,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $12,250?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and it's still well within the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12250}

Round 8

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This time, I'm going to sell to John.  We're only two rounds away from the end, and Bob is still too low on his offer.  While I would prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not comfortable risking another round and potentially ending up with a lower price. Selling to John for $12,000 is a safer and more secure option at this point."
