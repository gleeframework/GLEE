"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $12000 is a fair price, I'm hoping for something a little closer to $14000.  This product really is a great value, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $11000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I respect that.  However, $11000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, and I'm offering $13000.  This is a fair price, and I believe it's a great deal for you.  Let's see if we can make this work.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $13000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $11500. Can you meet me at this price?",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable here, but $11500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $12250?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and it's still well within the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",12250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $12250. I'm willing to pay $11750. Can you meet me at this price?",11750.0,Bob,8,
