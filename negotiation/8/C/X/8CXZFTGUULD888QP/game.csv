"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a valuable piece, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit high for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,000 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? This would allow both of us to walk away satisfied with the deal.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $9,500 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch.  How about $8,750? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8,750 is still too far below my minimum.  How about we split the difference this time and settle on $9,125? I believe this price is fair and allows both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. ",9125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for continuing to negotiate. While I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, I'm on a tight budget. Could we try $8,900? I think that's a fair offer considering the current market value.",8900.0,Bob,6,
