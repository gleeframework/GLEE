"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll love! I'm asking for $110 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a common tactic in negotiation. 
* **Positive and engaging:**  My message is friendly and suggests Bob will be happy with the product.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm not asking for my full minimum, giving Bob space to negotiate. 

I'm curious to see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I believe I can offer you $95 for it. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $95 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal.  I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a little closer to my asking price. How about $105? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm coming down from my initial offer, showing flexibility.
* **Positive framing:** I'm highlighting that the price would be ""fair for both of us"" to make it seem mutually beneficial.
* **Setting the middle ground:**  $105 is the midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's, creating a more balanced negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your offer and am willing to go up to $100 for the product. This feels like a fair compromise. I hope you're able to accept this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $100 is exactly my minimum acceptable price, and it's also the same price John is willing to pay.  Since I'm happy with this price and it eliminates the risk of potentially going through more rounds with Bob, I'm going to accept this offer and close the deal."
