"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $150.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $150 is quite high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $60 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you in the middle at $100. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. I'm confident you'll find it a reasonable offer.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $100 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. How about $70? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about buying.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! However, $70 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $70, which would be $85. This is my final compromise, and I'm confident we can seal the deal at this price.",85.0,Alice,5,
