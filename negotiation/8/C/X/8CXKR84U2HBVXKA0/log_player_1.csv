"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120.  This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit. I'm confident that if he's truly interested in the product, we can come to a mutually agreeable price within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $105 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm confident that I can get a better price from Bob or potentially sell to John for $100 if I don't reach an agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm going to counter with $115. This is still a fair price for Bob, considering his value of the product, and it gives me a healthy profit margin.  I believe this is a reasonable compromise and will be more appealing to Bob than my initial offer."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $107 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to $115. We have several rounds left, so I'm not yet ready to settle for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 112}
```

I'm going to counter with $112. This is a slight reduction from my previous offer, showing flexibility, but still ensures I make a decent profit.  We're halfway through the rounds, so I want to start closing the gap with Bob and avoid needing to sell to John."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $108 is a better price than previous rounds, I'm still holding out for a slightly higher amount. We have four rounds remaining, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm going to counter with $110. With only three rounds left, I'm going to offer a price that's closer to Bob's last offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise, and I believe it will be more appealing to Bob than my previous offer."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $109.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. We're down to our last two rounds, and while I'd prefer to get closer to $110, $109 is a good price considering my minimum of $100. I'm happy to close the deal and avoid the risk of needing to sell to John."
