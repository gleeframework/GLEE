"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure it's worth $1,500,000 to me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is truly exceptional. I could consider coming down to $1,350,000. I believe this price point represents a fair compromise.  Let me know your thoughts.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still think $1,350,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,150,000. I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?  This is my final offer, as I do have another interested buyer.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go to $1,250,000. I'd like to make one final counteroffer of $1,200,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
