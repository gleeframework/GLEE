Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure it's worth $1,500,000 to me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Although Bob's offer is a significant amount, it's still considerably less than my ideal price. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a compromise."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still think $1,350,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,150,000. I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

While $1,150,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a better price. I'll counteroffer again, but I'm getting closer to John's offer being the more appealing option."

Bob is holding firm, and while I'd prefer a higher price, $1,200,000 is a substantial amount and significantly more than my guaranteed offer from John. It's time to close the deal."
