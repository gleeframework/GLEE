"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That starting price is a bit high for me, though. I'm thinking something closer to $800,000 would be more reasonable.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway – how about $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While that price is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit steep for me. How about we settle at $950,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. $1,050,000 is my final offer – it's a compromise, but it ensures I'm getting a fair deal. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
