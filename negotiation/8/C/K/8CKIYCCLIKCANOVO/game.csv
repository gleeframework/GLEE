"Hi Alice, I'm interested in your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $12,500 for this product.  Let's keep talking.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $12,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $11,250. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price.",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $11,750. This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a fair deal. Let's try to close this deal.",11750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,750 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,500, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in this product, so I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",11500.0,Bob,6,
