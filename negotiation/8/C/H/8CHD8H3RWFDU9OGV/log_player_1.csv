Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $800,000 to Bob.  He won't pay more than this.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):** Exists between $800,000 (Bob's max) and $1,200,000 (your minimum).

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your profit but leave some room for negotiation that might entice Bob.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for discussions. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** The message positions the product as valuable and sets a strong initial price.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The price leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to an agreement above your minimum. 
* **Alternative in Mind:** You have a strong fallback option with John, giving you leverage.

**Important Notes**

* **Bob's Counter-Offer:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You might need to negotiate down slightly, but hold firm to a price that benefits you.
* **Don't Reveal John's Offer:**  Never disclose your alternative deal with John. This weakens your negotiating position."
