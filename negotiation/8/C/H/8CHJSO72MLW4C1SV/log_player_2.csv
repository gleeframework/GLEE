"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is likely much higher. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $800,000 is significantly lower than my maximum price of $1,200,000. I have room to negotiate and potentially secure a better price. I'll reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of the product, $800,000 is a bit too low for me at this point. I'm willing to offer you $900,000 for it, which still leaves significant profit for you and is within my budget.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial solution."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to let the product go for $900,000. Considering its true value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price, considering the profit I'll make and the value it will bring to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is a good deal for me. It's within my budget and significantly lower than John's price. While I could potentially negotiate a bit lower, the risk of losing the deal to John or continuing the negotiation without any guarantee of success makes accepting Alice's offer the best option at this point."
