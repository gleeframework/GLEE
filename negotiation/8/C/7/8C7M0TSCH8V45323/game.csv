"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product has potential, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,000,000. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $1,000,000 simply doesn't reflect the product's true value. Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,200,000, which is still a fair deal considering the product's potential. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
