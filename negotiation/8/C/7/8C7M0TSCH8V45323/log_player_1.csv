{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire this product, which I believe is a valuable asset for your business. My initial offer is $1,300,000, reflecting its high value and potential for your success. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's discuss!"", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product has potential, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,000,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low. While I'm open to negotiation, I won't accept a price that significantly undervalues the product. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $1,000,000 simply doesn't reflect the product's true value. Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,200,000, which is still a fair deal considering the product's potential. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
