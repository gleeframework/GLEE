Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to part with it for $12,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more firm in your valuation. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's benefits to Bob, you're attempting to justify the higher price, even if it's above his perceived value.
* **Time Pressure:**  Hinting at other buyers (""listing it publicly"") creates a sense of urgency and potential loss for Bob if he doesn't act quickly.

**Important Note:** While John guarantees $10,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob if the negotiation is successful."
