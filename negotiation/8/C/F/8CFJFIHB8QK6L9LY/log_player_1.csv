{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer starts high, but still leaves some room for negotiation. It also sets a clear price point for Bob to consider. This is a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $9,000 is more than what the product is worth to Bob, it is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. It's better to try and negotiate with Bob further to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good price.  While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $10,500?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll find it's still a great value."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $10,250 is still lower than my ideal selling price, it's close enough to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 and significantly better than Bob's previous offer. Accepting this offer allows me to secure a sale quickly and avoid further negotiation."
