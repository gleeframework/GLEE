"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $900,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its true worth. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value of the product to me, I'm willing to offer $750000. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $750,000 is a significant amount, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit. I'm offering $850,000.  This price is still a great value for you, considering the product's worth. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $800000, which is a fair price for both of us. This is my final offer, let's close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price. It's in my best interest to accept this offer and secure the deal.  Further negotiation could potentially lead to a higher price, but there's also a risk that Bob could walk away, and I'd be left with only the option of selling to John for the same price."
