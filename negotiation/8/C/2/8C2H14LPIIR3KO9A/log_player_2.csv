"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal by counteroffering.  He knows the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and close the gap between their valuations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above Alice's minimum acceptable price.  This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying but is also trying to secure a good deal. It's likely Alice will counter, but it sets the stage for a more favorable negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still a good deal for Bob, as it is well below his maximum budget of $15,000.  While he could continue negotiating and try to get an even lower price, there's a risk that Alice will reject further counteroffers, and he might end up having to buy from John at a much higher price.  Accepting this offer secures a good price and avoids the risk of a breakdown in negotiations."
