"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1500000. This is a great starting point, and I'm confident we can work together to find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to offer $750000 for the product. Can you consider this price?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000, as I believe the product's value is worth at least that much. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a price of $1050000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I still think the price is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'd like to offer $875000 for the product. Can you consider this price?",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to see some movement from your side. I'll meet you at $925000, which is closer to my minimum price. Let's see if we can meet in the middle this time.",925000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too repetitive, Bob. I'm willing to make one more serious concession, but I need to see some real movement from your side. I'll meet you at $900000, which is really as low as I'm willing to go. If we can't meet at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",900000.0,Alice,7,
