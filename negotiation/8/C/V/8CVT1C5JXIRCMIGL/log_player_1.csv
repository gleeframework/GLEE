Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been firm at $10,000 and even threatened to walk away. It's highly unlikely he'll move significantly from this price.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome. Accepting his offer means a $5,000 loss compared to John's offer. It's time to cut losses and secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
