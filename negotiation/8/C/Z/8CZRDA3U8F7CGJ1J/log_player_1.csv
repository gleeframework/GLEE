{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. We're getting very close to my desired price, and it's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob.  I'm not sure I can get a significantly better offer from him in the remaining rounds, and selling to John would be a big step backward in terms of earning."
