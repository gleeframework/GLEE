"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This sets a strong initial position and leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $600,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $800,000, and I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate. While selling to John for $800,000 is tempting, I'm hoping to secure a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a significant step down from my initial offer, but still above my minimum value. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob and reach a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is close to my minimum, I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating.  I believe I can still get a slightly higher price by continuing to counter. Selling to John for $800,000 is tempting, but I'm hoping to secure a little more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is a compromise, coming closer to Bob's last offer but still above my minimum. I'm hoping to find a sweet spot and close the deal before running out of rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Bob will reject my counteroffers or the deal will fall apart.  Accepting his offer ensures I get my minimum value and avoids further risk."
