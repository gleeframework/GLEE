"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above Bob's budget. It makes more sense to try negotiating with Alice first.  Bob can offer a lower price and see if Alice is willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount.  Starting at $600,000 is a bold move, but it signals to Alice that Bob is serious about negotiating and willing to pay a fair price, but not the full asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his limit.  Bob should continue to negotiate, as he may be able to get a better price.  There are still several rounds left to make a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his budget, but still trying to get a good deal.  $750,000 is a compromise, and may be attractive to Alice if she's willing to meet halfway. It shows that Bob is serious about buying the product, but is also firm on his price limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is close to Bob's budget, he's only $50,000 away from getting the product from John.  It makes sense to keep negotiating with Alice, hoping she'll lower her price just a bit more to make the deal worthwhile.  There are still several rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now at his budget limit, but he's also confident that he can get the product for $800,000.  If Alice rejects this offer, Bob can simply buy from John. This is Bob's final offer before resorting to John's offer."
