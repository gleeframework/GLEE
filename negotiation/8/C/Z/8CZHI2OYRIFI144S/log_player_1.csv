Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,100,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives room for negotiation while still leaving a healthy profit margin.
* **Reasoning:**  I'm framing the offer as fair and based on Bob's potential gain, which can make him more receptive.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message invites Bob to respond, making him feel like he has some control in the process. 

**Note:** This is just a starting point.  I'll need to adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses and the time constraints of negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $950000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  Selling to John guarantees me that amount, making it a safer option at this point.  

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum, aiming to find a compromise. I'll also need to consider the time constraints and the potential for Bob to walk away from the deal entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and it reflects my desire to work with you. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price from $1,100,000 to $1,050,000. This shows flexibility while still maintaining a good profit margin.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value he sees in the product and emphasizing my willingness to work with him.
* **""Meet Me Halfway"":** This phrase encourages Bob to see the offer as a fair middle ground. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely monitor Bob's reaction to this counteroffer. If he rejects it, I'll need to consider my options carefully, including raising the price slightly or potentially selling to John if the negotiation is not fruitful."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $975000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While it's closer than before, the difference is still significant enough to justify rejecting his offer.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer with a price slightly lower than my previous one, aiming to find a middle ground.  However, I will also keep in mind that I can always sell to John for $1,200,000, which provides a safety net and bargaining power."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This is a small adjustment from my previous offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find a compromise here."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Small Adjustment:** I'm only lowering the price by $25,000, demonstrating my commitment to finding a solution while still maintaining a reasonable profit.
* **Fairness Emphasis:** I'm reiterating the idea of a fair price for both of us, encouraging Bob to see the value in the offer.
* **Compromise:** I'm explicitly mentioning the need for a compromise, implying that this offer is my final attempt to reach an agreement. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely monitor Bob's response. If he rejects this offer, I'm prepared to sell to John for $1,200,000. The risk of Bob walking away becomes increasingly high with each rejected offer, so I need to be decisive and strategic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to pay $990000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Despite Bob's increased offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  We've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and there's a high chance that Bob won't budge further.  To guarantee my minimum profit and avoid further potential delays, I will sell the product to John."
