"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. I believe this product has the potential to significantly benefit your business. While I can't disclose the exact details just yet, I can assure you its worth is no less than $1500000 to me. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. This is a price that reflects the true value of the product, but also allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Please consider this offer carefully, as I'm confident you won't regret it. Let me know if you're interested in learning more. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I'm not interested in paying $2,000,000 for the product, especially since Alice thinks it's worth no less than $1,500,000 to her. That's a pretty big markup. I'll reject the offer and buy the product from John for $800,000 instead.
