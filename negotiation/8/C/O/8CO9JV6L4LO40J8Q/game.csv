"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000, which is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,500,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, I'm looking to acquire it for a price closer to my maximum budget. I'd be willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price that still allows you to make a profit, while providing me with a significant savings.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I have to make a profit too. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is a compromise that should work for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,050,000. This price point allows you to make a profit while giving me a significant savings. I'm confident this is a fair and mutually beneficial deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still a bit hesitant, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I believe this price is fair and reasonable considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $1,100,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go a little higher, but I'm firm on $1,075,000. This is a good compromise and gets us closer to a deal. Let's make it happen.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'll give you a slight concession, but I need to get at least $1,080,000. This is my last offer, and I'm counting on you to make a decision.",1080000.0,Alice,7,
