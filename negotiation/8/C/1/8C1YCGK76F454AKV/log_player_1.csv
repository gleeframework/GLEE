Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm setting the price at $20,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Starting with a higher offer allows you to potentially maximize your profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Even if Bob doesn't accept the initial offer, it opens the door for negotiation. He might counter with a lower price, and you can still potentially settle on a price higher than $15,000.
* **Backup Option:** You have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 from John, so there's limited risk in aiming higher with Bob.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have some flexibility in your pricing and are comfortable with the possibility of negotiation."
