Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum. This gives him room to negotiate without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message is friendly and open to negotiation.  I'm signaling that I'm willing to discuss the price further.
* **Alternative Buyer:** The presence of John, willing to pay my minimum, gives me leverage and makes Bob more likely to negotiate seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $950000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum but still below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm going to reject it and counteroffer with a price closer to my ideal outcome. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I have a chance to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm hoping to get closer to $1,000,000 for the product.  How about we split the difference and settle on $975,000?  This would give us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 975000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm counteroffering with a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Reiterate Value:**  I remind Bob that the product is valuable and that a price of $975,000 is fair.
* **Focus on Win-Win:** I emphasize that the price would provide a good deal for both of us, making it more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground, Alice. While I understand your position, I must stick to my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $960000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $960,000 is very close to my desired price. While I'd prefer $975,000, it's not worth risking the deal by continuing to negotiate. The risk of Bob walking away or me needing to sell to John for a lower profit outweighs the potential gain of a few thousand dollars. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a good profit."
