# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this valuable product to you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000.

# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you place on the product and the original price I had in mind.

While Alice's offer of $850,000 is lower than her initial offer, it's still above your budget. You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You can offer a counteroffer closer to $750,000 or even slightly higher to see if you can reach a compromise."
