"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This gives us both a good deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet at $9,800?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While I'm happy to negotiate,  $9,800 is still a bit too far from where I need to be.  Let's split the difference again - how about $10,150? That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.",10150.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear your concern about finding common ground.  While I value your interest, $9,500 is still too low for me.  Let's bridge the gap one more time. I'm willing to go down to $10,000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, and shows my commitment to working with you. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,200 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9200.0,Bob,8,
