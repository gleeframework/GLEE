"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $15000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $14000 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably spend. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $12000. It's a fair price for a product that I'm genuinely interested in.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $13500. It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $13000. It's a fair price considering we're both close to our desired price. What do you say?",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $13000, but I'd like to add a bit more to the price. How about $13500? It's a small increase, but it's still a good deal for you.",13500.0,Alice,7,
