"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its features and benefits, I'm asking for $22,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's important to signal that you're looking for a much lower price.  We'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way beyond my budget for this product. I'm interested, but only if we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider something closer to $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Price Drop:**  We need to make it clear that Alice's initial offer is unrealistic. Our counteroffer of $10,000 is a substantial decrease, signaling that we're serious buyers but not willing to be taken advantage of.
* **Room to Negotiate:**  Starting at $10,000 leaves us room to negotiate up while still staying well below our $8,000 maximum and John's alternative offer.
* **Polite and Professional:**  Maintaining a positive tone encourages Alice to continue negotiating.  We want to find a deal, not scare her off."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $22,000 reflects the true value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $18,000. This is a significant price reduction and I believe it's a fair offer considering the value you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:**  While Alice's offer has come down, $18,000 is still significantly more than our $8,000 limit and John's offer.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, which is a good sign. We need to demonstrate that we're also willing to be flexible but won't settle for a price that doesn't work for us.
* **Time Consideration:** We have plenty of rounds left, so there's no need to rush. We'll continue to counteroffer strategically."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $18,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  Could we meet somewhere around $13,000? I believe that would be a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 13000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual Approach:**  We're making another significant jump down in price, but not as drastic as our initial counteroffer.  This shows Alice we're serious but also willing to negotiate.
* **Middle Ground:** $13,000 puts us closer to the middle ground between her previous offer and our ideal price range. This leaves room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Deadline Awareness:** While we have time, it's good to start edging closer to a reasonable price point. This counteroffer encourages Alice to make more substantial moves if she wants to close the deal."
