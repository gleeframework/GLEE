"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its features and benefits, I'm asking for $22,000. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way beyond my budget for this product. I'm interested, but only if we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider something closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $22,000 reflects the true value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $18,000. This is a significant price reduction and I believe it's a fair offer considering the value you'll gain.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $18,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  Could we meet somewhere around $13,000? I believe that would be a fair compromise.",13000.0,Bob,4,
