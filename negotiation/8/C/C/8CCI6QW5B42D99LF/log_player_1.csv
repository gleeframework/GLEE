"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts high but leaves room for negotiation, potentially leading to a win-win situation. It's important to be friendly and open to negotiation in this first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the discount, but I would like to propose a price of $13,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,000 is a good price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll reject this offer and counter with a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down on your price. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $13,500.  This is still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to making a deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
