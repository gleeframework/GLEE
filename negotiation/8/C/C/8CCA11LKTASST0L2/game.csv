"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $950,000 is a bit outside my budget at this time.  I'm interested in purchasing, but I'd like to start with an offer of $700,000.  This reflects the value I see in the product and allows us to move forward with a deal.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $825,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $825,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit too high.  To finalize this deal, I'd like to offer $775,000.  This is a fair compromise that gives us both a good outcome.  What do you think?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $775,000 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value and the effort we've put into the negotiation so far, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'll meet you at $800,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a good outcome for both of us.",800000.0,Alice,5,
