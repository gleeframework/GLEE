Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only go up to $8,500.  Let's see if we can find common ground.

I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $8,500 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $10,500.
