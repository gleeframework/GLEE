"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $120. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you.",120.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $100, which is $110. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you.",110.0,Alice,5,
