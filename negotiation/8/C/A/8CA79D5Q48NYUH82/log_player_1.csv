"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. I think it's a great deal for you, as it's worth a lot more to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value but still below my minimum. This allows for room for negotiation.
* **Highlight Value:** Emphasizing the product's value to me subtly suggests its worth to Bob.
* **Openness:** Ending with a question encourages Bob to respond and keeps the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150 and doesn't even come close to my initial offer.
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob is interested, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and hopefully find a more favorable price.
* **Not a desperate seller:** Selling to John for $150 is a secure option, but I'm not desperate. I'm willing to continue the negotiation with Bob and potentially get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $100 is simply too low.  Let's meet in the middle -  $125. I'm confident you'll find this product very valuable."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not desperate to sell at a loss.
* **Reiterate Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value. This might influence his decision to come closer to my price.
* **Clear and Concise:**  I'm keeping the message short and direct, focusing on the price and leaving room for Bob to counter if he wants to."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle ground. How about $110? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, $110 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Continued Negotiation:** There's still room for negotiation. I'm not willing to sell at a loss, but I'm also not desperate. 
* **Opportunity for Higher Price:**  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open, giving me the chance to counter and potentially get a higher price.
* **John's Offer:**  While selling to John for $150 is a safe option, I'm not ready to give up on getting a better deal with Bob.  I have several rounds left, so I can afford to be patient."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  However, $110 is still a bit low for me.  How about $115? That's a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increase:** I'm increasing the price slightly, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but still not willing to sell for too low a price.
* **Compromise Language:**  I'm emphasizing the ""fair compromise"" aspect to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm highlighting the benefits of the deal for both of us. This encourages Bob to feel good about accepting.
* **Continuing Negotiation:** I'm keeping the negotiation open, as I believe there's still room to reach a mutually acceptable price."
