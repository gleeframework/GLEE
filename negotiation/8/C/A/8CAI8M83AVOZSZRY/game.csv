"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering my budget and the value I see in your product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my minimum. I'm offering you the product for $875,000. This price reflects the value of the product and is still a great deal for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",875000.0,Alice,3,
