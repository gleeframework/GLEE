I'm starting with my highest possible price, as that gives me the best chance of maximizing my profit. If Bob rejects, I can always negotiate down or sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to try and negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it's still higher than Bob's offer and closer to my minimum acceptable price. This should hopefully encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to try and negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to $1,050,000. This is a compromise, but it's still a reasonable price considering the value of the product to me. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I would prefer to get closer to my desired price, I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely and having to settle for John's offer. It's better to accept Bob's offer and secure the deal."
