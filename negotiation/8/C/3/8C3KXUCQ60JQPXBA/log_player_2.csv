{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price.  $75 is a good starting point, but you might be able to get it lower."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 50}
``` 

I'm going to start by offering Alice $50. This is a significant discount from her initial price, and I'm hoping she'll be willing to negotiate. If she rejects this offer, I'll adjust my counteroffer in the next round based on her reaction."

Alice is coming down in price, but it's still higher than I'd like to pay. I'll counteroffer again and see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm going to offer $60. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer.  I'm hoping this will be close enough to her desired price to reach a deal."

Alice is still a bit high, but it seems we're getting closer. I'll counter again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 63}

I'm going to offer $63.  This is a slight increase from my previous offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise. Hopefully, it's close enough to Alice's price that we can finalize the deal."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $67.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to my target.  While I'd love to get it lower,  I'm worried that continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether. It's a good price and worth accepting to avoid the risk of buying from John at a much higher price."
