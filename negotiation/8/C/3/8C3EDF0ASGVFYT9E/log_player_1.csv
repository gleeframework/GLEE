Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $175, which is higher than Bob's minimum, but not outrageously so.  I want to see if I can get a good deal, but I'm also aware that I have a backup buyer in John, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob isn't willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I want to sell the product, I'm not willing to take a loss. I'm going to counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, but still above what Bob is willing to pay. I want to see if we can come to a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 165} 
```

I'm offering $165, which is a compromise between my original offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I won't settle for a price that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk him walking away completely.  Plus, John is also offering the same price, so I'm not losing anything by accepting Bob's offer."
