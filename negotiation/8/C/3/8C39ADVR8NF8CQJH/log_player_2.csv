You can do better than $130. It's worth rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $115. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $125. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125

You can still do better than $125. Reject and make another counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $125 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $120? That way, we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 120}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I think $127 is the lowest I can go. It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $127. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $127
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, it's better to accept Alice's offer.  You're only saving $3 compared to buying from John, and there's no guarantee that you'll be able to negotiate further down. It's better to lock in the deal and secure the product."
