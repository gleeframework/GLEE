"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $115. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $125. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $125 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $120? That way, we both get a fair deal.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I think $127 is the lowest I can go. It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",127.0,Alice,5,
