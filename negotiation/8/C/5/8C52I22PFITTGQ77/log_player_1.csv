Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Backup:** You have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,200,000.

**Strategy**

The key is to find a price that benefits both of you while maximizing your profit. Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you have leverage.  You should aim for a price closer to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it would be a significant asset to you. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:** Keeps things professional and highlights the product's value.
* **The Price:** $1,400,000 leaves a substantial profit margin for you while still saving Bob $100,000 compared to his valuation.

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You have room to negotiate down slightly, but always stay above your $1,200,000 minimum.
* **Confidence:**  Project confidence in your offer. You have a valuable product and a backup plan.
