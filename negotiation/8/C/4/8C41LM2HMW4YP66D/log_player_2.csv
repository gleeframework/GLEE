"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth a lot to me, but I believe it could be even more valuable in the right hands. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. This is a fair starting point, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's not even close to a mutually beneficial agreement. I need to negotiate further and see if Alice is willing to come down in price."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1000000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial offer. How about $1250000?  This is a compromise that still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and I believe it's fair considering the potential benefits you'll gain from this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than my maximum budget.  I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target price."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close. I'm willing to make one final concession. Let's meet in the middle at $1100000. This is a fair price for both of us. If you're truly interested in this product, I believe this is the best we can do. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.
