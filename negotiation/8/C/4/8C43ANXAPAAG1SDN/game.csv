"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for some room for negotiation.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a compromise of $1,050,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you've placed on the product, while also ensuring I get a good return on my investment.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to acquiring the product. I believe it's a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to increase your offer. However, $950,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
