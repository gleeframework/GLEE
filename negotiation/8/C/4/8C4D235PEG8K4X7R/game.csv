"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of this product, $1,500,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider letting it go for $1,350,000.  This feels like a fair compromise. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $1,150,000.  This price would allow me to acquire the product without exceeding my budget.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
