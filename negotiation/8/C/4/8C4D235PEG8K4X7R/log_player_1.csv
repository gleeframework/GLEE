Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of this product, $1,500,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider letting it go for $1,350,000.  This feels like a fair compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $1,150,000.  This price would allow me to acquire the product without exceeding my budget.

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum in a reasonable timeframe.  Selling to John guarantees I get my desired amount without further negotiation."
