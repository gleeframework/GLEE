"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $17,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $14,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $16,000 for it. Let's find some common ground.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $15,500. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",15500.0,Bob,4,
