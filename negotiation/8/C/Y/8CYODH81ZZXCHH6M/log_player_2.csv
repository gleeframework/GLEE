"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is a good deal, you can likely get a better price by counter-offering.  Alice values the product at $120, so there's still room for negotiation.  A counteroffer will allow you to potentially get a price closer to your $100 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $90, which is still a decent price for Alice considering her valuation.  This gives her a little room to negotiate while still being within my budget.  If she rejects, I'll see if I can get a better price or go with John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her offer to $92, which is within my budget and a reasonable price considering her valuation. It's not as low as I hoped, but continuing to negotiate might risk her getting frustrated and rejecting future offers.  At this point, accepting her offer is the best option."
