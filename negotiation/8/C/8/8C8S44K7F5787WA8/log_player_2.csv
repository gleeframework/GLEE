"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! Given its value, I think a starting price of $14,500 feels fair.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $14,500 is above Bob's ideal price point.
* **Alternative:** John is offering the product for $15,000, which is only slightly higher than Alice's initial offer. 
* **Strategy:**  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price. This is a better strategy than buying from John immediately, as there's potential to save money by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you starting the conversation. I'm interested in the product, but I'm looking to pay closer to $13,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save money.
* **Alice's initial offer:** Too high.
* **Counteroffer:** $13,000 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. It's still above Alice's value for the product, but significantly lower than her initial offer.
* **Strategy:** This counteroffer shows Bob's willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a strong position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

* **Alternative:** John is offering the product for $15,000, which is only slightly higher than Alice's offer.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my target price.  How about we settle on $13,500?  I'm really interested in the product, and I think this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save money.
* **Alice's offer:**  While closer to Bob's desired price, $13,750 is still a bit high.
* **Counteroffer:** $13,500 is a compromise. It's a small increment closer to Alice's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate while remaining within Bob's budget.
* **Strategy:**  This approach demonstrates Bob's commitment to finding a mutually agreeable price, while staying true to his goal of saving money."
