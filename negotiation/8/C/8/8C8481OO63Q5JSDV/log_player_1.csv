Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115.  It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a starting point that balances the need to maximize profit with the desire to secure a deal.  Here's the rationale:

* **$115 is above Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still leaving you a profit.
* **It's below your minimum:**  You're willing to go lower, but not below your minimum, ensuring you don't lose money.
* **The message is friendly and encouraging:**  This sets a positive tone for the negotiation. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for a loss.  

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, trying to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $100 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $110? It's still a great deal for you, and I can make it work on my end."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Rationale:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows willingness to meet Bob halfway,  demonstrating flexibility.
* **Still profitable:**  $110 is still above my minimum threshold, ensuring a profit.
* **Positive tone:**  I reiterate my willingness to work with Bob, keeping the negotiation amicable.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground, hopefully leading to a mutually acceptable agreement."
