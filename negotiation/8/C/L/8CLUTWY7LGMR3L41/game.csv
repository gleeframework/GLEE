"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. While I acknowledge its uniqueness, $1200000 is at the upper limit of my budget. I'd be happy to purchase it for $1000000.  This would allow for a mutually beneficial agreement.  What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1100000.
