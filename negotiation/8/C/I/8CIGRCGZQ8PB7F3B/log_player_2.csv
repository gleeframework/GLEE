"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

``` 
 
The product is worth $80 to you, so accepting Alice's offer would mean paying more than it's worth. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to take it off your hands for $90. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $100? It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is closer to your ideal price, it's still above your maximum value of $80. It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $100 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $95?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $95 yet. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $98? It's still a bit above your original offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $98
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $98 is still above your maximum value of $80.  Since you have a guaranteed option to buy from John for $80, it's best to stop negotiating and take advantage of that deal."
