"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to take it off your hands for $90. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $100? It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $100 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $95?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $95 yet. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $98? It's still a bit above your original offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",98.0,Alice,5,
