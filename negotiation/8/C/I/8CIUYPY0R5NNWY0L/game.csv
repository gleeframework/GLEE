"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm hoping to get a better price.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  This is still a good deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what I'm willing to pay and closer to what you're willing to sell for. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
