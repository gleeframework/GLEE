"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what you're willing to pay and more than what I'm willing to sell it for. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation to potentially save more money. It's worth trying to get a lower price from Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm hoping to get a better price.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  This is still a good deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what I'm willing to pay and closer to what you're willing to sell for. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm looking for a bit more.  How about $1,350,000?  This would still be a great deal for both of us, and we can close the deal quickly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,350,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's still lower than what Bob is willing to pay and closer to Bob's target price.  Continuing to negotiate might save a bit more, but the risk of Alice rejecting further offers and forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price is too high."
