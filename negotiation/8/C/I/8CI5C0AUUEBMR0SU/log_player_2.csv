"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It's always beneficial to try to negotiate a better price.  Even if the negotiation fails, you have the option to buy from John at a price you're comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a bold counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This shows my intent to negotiate aggressively and hopefully pushes her to consider a more reasonable price. It's unlikely she'll accept this immediately, but it sets the stage for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her first one, it's still above my maximum budget.  I'm going to reject and continue negotiating in hopes of getting closer to my target price.  Even if the negotiation fails, buying from John is still a viable option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer, but still keeping it below my maximum budget. This shows that I'm willing to compromise but also highlights that I'm serious about getting a good deal. It's a middle ground between my last offer and Alice's latest offer, hopefully encouraging her to meet me halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $1,200,000.  While it's closer to what I'm willing to pay, I believe I can still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. I'm confident that I can push Alice further down, and if I fail, I can always fall back on buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final offer.  I'm going for my maximum budget, hoping Alice will finally accept.  It's a fair price for both of us, as she's willing to sell for this amount and it's the maximum I'm willing to pay. If she rejects this, I will buy from John."
