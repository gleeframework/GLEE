Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  while I appreciate your offer,  $1,600,000 is far above my budget.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still outside of my comfort zone. I'm confident that $950,000 is a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While Bob is increasing his offer, he's still significantly below my minimum. John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is a better outcome than continuing to negotiate with Bob and risking a lower final price."
