Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $950000 for the product.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price.  I'll see what Bob's next counteroffer is before considering selling to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints. While I believe this product is worth more, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $975,000? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 975000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. Considering the value I place on the product, I'd like to propose a price of $960000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher price, $960,000 is a good deal and I'm not sure I can get much more from Bob.  I'm also concerned about the time limit and the risk of losing the deal altogether.  It's time to secure the sale."
