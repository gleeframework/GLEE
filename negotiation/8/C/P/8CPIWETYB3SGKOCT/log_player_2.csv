"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you.  I'm asking for $2,000,000 to start negotiations.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far too high ($2,000,000) compared to my maximum budget ($1,000,000). It's not even worth considering.  I will start negotiating with Alice by rejecting her initial offer and making a counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm  prepared to offer $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value to me, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the value of this product is truly significant.  I could come down to $1,750,000.  I'm confident this is a price that reflects its worth and potential.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my maximum budget.  I'm not comfortable paying more than $1,000,000. I'll reject this offer and see if I can get Alice to come down further."

This demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring the product, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
