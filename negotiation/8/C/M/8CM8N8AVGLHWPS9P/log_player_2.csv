"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this amazing product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $60."", ""product_price"": 60}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($60) than my maximum budget ($80). This leaves room for negotiation and signals that Alice's initial price was far off the mark.
* **Leaving Room:**  Even if Alice completely rejects this offer, I have plenty of room to increase my bid in subsequent rounds.
* **Alternative Option:** I'm keeping in mind that I can always buy the product from John for $80. This gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. However, I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. Let's try $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we try to split the difference again?  I'm willing to go up to $75."", ""product_price"": 75} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** I'm gradually increasing my offer to show Alice I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not jumping drastically. 
* **Staying Below Max:** I'm still aiming to pay less than my maximum budget, giving me some bargaining power. 
* **Time Consideration:** We're getting closer to my walk-away point ($80 from John), and I want to see if Alice is willing to move further before I consider that option seriously."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're willing to compromise, Bob! However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time, I'll go a bit higher than the middle point. Let's try $92.50. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to anchor the price above my maximum budget. Even though she's making concessions, her latest offer of $92.50 is still significantly higher than my $80 walk-away point. It's unlikely she'll come down enough to make it worthwhile to continue.  I'd rather secure the product from John at a price I know is fair."
