"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000.  I believe it's a great value considering its worth to you.  Let me know what you think!",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer!  While I appreciate the product,  $18,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is still a great deal for you.  Let's try to find a middle ground. ",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $15,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering I'm willing to pay more than John's offer. Let's see if we can close this deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $13,000 still doesn't quite meet my minimum.  I'm willing to compromise and accept $14,000 for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to finalize this deal. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking to my offer of $13,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal.  I'm confident we can find a middle ground.",13000.0,Bob,6,
