Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit. While Bob values the product at $800,000, he might be willing to pay more if he sees its potential value.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle the price down. 
* **Create Urgency:** Mentioning other interested parties (""limited-time offer"") could incentivize Bob to act quickly.

This approach aims to strike a balance between getting the best price from Bob while ensuring you don't lose the sale entirely and have to settle for John's offer."
