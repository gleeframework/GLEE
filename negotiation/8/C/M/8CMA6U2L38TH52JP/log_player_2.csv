"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is better than John's price, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much as possible. Offering $13,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer and a good starting point for further negotiation. This price is still within Bob's budget and leaves room for Alice to make a counteroffer that could still be profitable for her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than Bob's ideal price, but it's closer to the acceptable range.  Rejecting this offer again allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially push for a lower price. It also keeps the pressure on Alice to find a mutually agreeable price before Bob decides to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, demonstrating his willingness to compromise while still seeking a price lower than Alice's latest offer. This middle ground strategy keeps negotiations moving without pushing Alice away completely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now the same as John's. While continuing negotiations might potentially lead to a better price, it's risky. There's no guarantee Alice will budge further, and the time constraint adds pressure. Buying from John ensures Bob gets the product within his budget without further negotiation."
