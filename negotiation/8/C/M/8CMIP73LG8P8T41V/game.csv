"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking of something more in the range of $1,000,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product considering its value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 to reflect the value we both see in this product. This price still gives you a significant margin for profit while ensuring I meet my minimum target. Let's continue this conversation and see if we can reach a deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Would you be open to discussing a price of $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, and it's clear we're getting closer to an agreement. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than where I need to be. Let's split the difference between our last offers. I'm willing to go down to $1,075,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a good profit for both of us.  What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
