"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product.  Given its value, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $2,300,000 is far above my budget of $800,000.  It's best to reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is quite high. I'm interested in this product, but my budget is significantly lower. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price given its value and my potential gains."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

My counteroffer of $1,000,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial price. This is a more realistic starting point for negotiation while still leaving room for compromise. It's important to be upfront about my budget limitations to establish a more reasonable negotiation range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it falls significantly short of what I consider fair value. I'm open to negotiation but need to see a more realistic proposal.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,900,000 is still too high for my budget. While it's a significant decrease from her initial offer, it's still out of reach.  I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000. This represents a significant commitment on my part, and I believe it's a fair starting point for us to continue our negotiation."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $1,200,000, showing flexibility and a willingness to compromise.  This is still within my budget, but it's a significant move towards Alice's desired price. I'm framing it as a ""fair starting point"" to encourage further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a workable figure. To keep this moving, I'm willing to consider $1,700,000. This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,700,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a price closer to my target.  I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,700,000 is still outside my comfortable range. I'm prepared to offer $1,400,000. This is a substantial increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again to $1,400,000, showing continued progress towards Alice's desired price while staying within my budget.  I'm emphasizing the ""substantial increase"" and ""mutual benefit"" to highlight my commitment to finding a solution and encourage Alice to accept my offer."
