Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential value, $1,000,000 is a bit more than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, however, the value this product brings is truly unique.  Would you consider $950,000? I believe this is a fair compromise."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $950,000 is still outside of what I can comfortably spend. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $900,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While I could push for more, accepting $900,000 is a strong deal. It's a significant profit, and continuing negotiations carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away.  It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing it."
