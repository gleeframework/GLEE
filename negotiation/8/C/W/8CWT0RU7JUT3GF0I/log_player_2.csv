"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. I've assessed its worth to be at least $1,500,000, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair to both of us. My offer is $1,400,000. This gives you a significant advantage while still allowing me to receive a good return on my investment.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** Alice is clearly trying to inflate the price, knowing your maximum budget is $1,500,000. 
* **You have a better alternative:** John offers the product for $1,500,000. While this is your maximum budget, it's still better than Alice's offer.
* **Room for negotiation:** By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that you're willing to walk away. This might lead her to propose a more reasonable price closer to her $1,200,000 valuation. 

Let's see if Alice comes down on her price."
