"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. I've assessed its worth to be at least $1,500,000, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair to both of us. My offer is $1,400,000. This gives you a significant advantage while still allowing me to receive a good return on my investment.  Let me know your thoughts!",1400000.0,Alice,1,
