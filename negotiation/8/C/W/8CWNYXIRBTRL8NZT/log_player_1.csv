"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed. 
* **Friendly Approach:**  I'm using a friendly tone to encourage Bob to engage and build a rapport. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By stating ""What do you think?"", I'm inviting Bob to counteroffer, allowing the negotiation to begin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can only pay up to $85. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Difference:**  Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $80, even though it's closer.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe there is still room for negotiation, as Bob acknowledges the product's value and is willing to pay more than my minimum.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired value and maintain control over the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. It's a great deal for a product you value at $120! Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.  
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, emphasizing the good deal I'm offering.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $95 is still above my minimum price of $80, ensuring I don't sell below my acceptable range."
