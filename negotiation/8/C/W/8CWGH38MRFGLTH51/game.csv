"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  I'm confident it can be a huge asset to you. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,900,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts.",1900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,900,000 is a bit steep for me.  Considering the value I place on the product, I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product. While $1,200,000 is a significant jump, I'm aiming for a price point closer to $1,700,000. This reflects the true worth and potential this product holds. Are you open to finding a middle ground in that range?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,700,000 is still outside my budget. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to go to $1,400,000. This feels like a fair compromise considering the value we both see in this deal.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
