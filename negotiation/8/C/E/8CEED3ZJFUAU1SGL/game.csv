"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to save as much as I can. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $11,000?  That's still a great deal for you considering its value to you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $11,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'd like to stay within my budget. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,4,
