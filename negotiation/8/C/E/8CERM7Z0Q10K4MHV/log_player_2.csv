"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob's budget.  While the product may be worth $1,200,000 to Alice, Bob is only willing to pay up to $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $850,000 is a bit low for me, but I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $950,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair compromise.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still above Bob's budget.  While it's a compromise, Bob is still saving $50,000 by rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer.  It's likely that Alice is willing to negotiate further, especially since Bob has already shown interest in the product."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $900,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell the product to you for $925,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise given the value I know the product has to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $925,000 is still too high for Bob.  While it's a compromise, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Instead of continuing to negotiate, Bob can secure the product from John for a guaranteed $800,000. This ensures a lower price and a certain deal."
