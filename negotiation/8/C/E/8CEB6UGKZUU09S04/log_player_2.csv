Round 7
Alice's offer:

**Reasoning:** At this point, Alice is very unlikely to go below John's price of $1,200,000. She's consistently meeting in the middle, and the difference is getting smaller. It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially ending up with a worse deal.  Buying from John guarantees the $1,200,000 price."
