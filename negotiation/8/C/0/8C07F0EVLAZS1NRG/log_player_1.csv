"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $18,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $15,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

It's better to accept the $13,000 offer from Bob. Here's why:

* **Profitable:** $13,000 is still a $3,000 profit over your minimum acceptable price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate risks Bob walking away. John's offer is a guaranteed $10,000, but Bob's offer provides a potential for higher profit.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now means you have the money sooner, which always has value."
