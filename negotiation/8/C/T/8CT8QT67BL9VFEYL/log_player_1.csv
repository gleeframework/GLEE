Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $2,300,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget of $1,000,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. Can we meet in the middle and discuss further?
