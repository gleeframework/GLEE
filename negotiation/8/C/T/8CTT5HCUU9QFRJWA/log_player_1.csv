{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum because I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I can always lower the price in a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value, but my budget allows me to pay no more than $90 for it. Would you consider adjusting your price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to sell it to you for $95.  That's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, based on my budget, I am only able to offer $90 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob has been insistent on $90, which is below my minimum.  While I could continue to counteroffer,  it's likely this will just go back and forth.  I'm happy to sell to John for $100, which meets my minimum requirement."
