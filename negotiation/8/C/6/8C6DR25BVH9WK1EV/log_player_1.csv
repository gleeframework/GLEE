"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $12,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm hoping to get closer to my initial price. I'll counter his offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $12,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to come down to $15,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't be disappointed with the product."", ""product_price"": 15000}
