Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $12,000.  I believe it holds significant value, and this offer reflects that. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price later. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest and potential budget.  His response will guide your next move. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $8,000 with John, so there's little risk in aiming higher with Bob."
