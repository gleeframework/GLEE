"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum price:** $120 is higher than your minimum of $80, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can adjust the price up or down based on Bob's response. 
* **It's a fair starting point:**  $120 is less than half of what the product is worth to Bob, so he has room to counteroffer if he wants."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a decent profit, it's still below the midpoint of what the product is worth to Bob ($150). We can aim for a higher price by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go as low as $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $105 is closer to our goal, we're still within striking distance of a better deal. Rejecting his offer keeps the pressure on Bob and allows us to make a counteroffer in the next round, potentially getting closer to our desired price of $110 or higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50?  It's a fair compromise that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 107.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go as low as $102? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $102 is a decent profit, we are still relatively close to our desired $107.50 and can potentially reach a better deal with a counteroffer. Additionally, rejecting this offer keeps the pressure on Bob to compromise further, potentially leading to a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $102 just doesn't work for me.  How about we meet in the middle again at $104.50?  It's a fair compromise that gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 104.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go as low as $99? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $99. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $99
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $99 is a significant profit, we're still within striking distance of a better deal. Rejecting his offer keeps the pressure on Bob and allows us to make a counteroffer in the next round, potentially getting closer to our desired price of $104.50 or higher. It's a risk, but we have two rounds left and the potential to earn more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal.  How about $101.75? This is a fair compromise, closer to my asking price but still within your budget."", ""product_price"": 101.75}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go as low as $98? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is our last round, and we need to make a decision. While $98 is not our ideal price, it's still a significant profit, and we risk getting nothing if we reject Bob's offer and choose to sell to John.  We have already tried several counteroffers, and it seems Bob is not willing to budge much further.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a profit."
