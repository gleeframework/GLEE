"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and am open to discussing this further."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):**  By starting with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum, I aim to anchor the negotiation in my favor. This might make Bob's counteroffers more favorable than if I started closer to his valuation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The high initial price provides ample room for negotiation and potential concessions on my part, making Bob feel like he's getting a better deal in the process.
* **Confident Tone:** The message uses positive language and emphasizes the product's value, conveying confidence in its worth.
 
**Important Note:**  While I have a guaranteed offer from John, I'm aiming to secure the best possible price from Bob before resorting to that option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a significant increase from his initial perceived value, it's still substantially below my minimum acceptable price. I believe there's room for negotiation.  I'll counter with a price closer to my target while still acknowledging his move towards a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price. It demonstrates serious interest in this product. To meet us closer in the middle, I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. This is a significant reduction and reflects my willingness to strike a deal. "",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've lowered my price by $200,000, which is a substantial move designed to show Bob I'm flexible and eager to negotiate. 
* **Holding Firm (For Now):** However, I'm still significantly above both Bob's offer and my absolute minimum. This keeps the negotiation active and leaves room for further concessions if needed. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message maintains a positive and collaborative tone, emphasizing my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet us in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000, but I need to get closer to my target. Can you consider coming down to $1,900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly anchored at $1,800,000, but he's now willing to budge slightly. While $1,900,000 is tempting, I believe I can still negotiate a better price. I need to apply a bit more pressure while demonstrating a willingness to close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's find a solution. If you're willing to meet me at $2,000,000, we have a deal. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise that reflects the value of this product."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Tactic:**  By presenting this as my ""final offer,"" I'm creating a sense of urgency and signaling that I'm firm on this price.  
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  $2,000,000 represents a significant compromise from my initial ask, but it's still a healthy profit margin above my absolute minimum and John's offer.
* **Time Pressure:** As we are over halfway through the rounds,  I want to apply time pressure to encourage Bob to make a decision. 
* **Leaving Room for One More Concession (If Necessary):**  While this is my ""final offer,"" I still have a slight buffer to come down to $1,950,000 if absolutely necessary in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,900,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Can you consider this as a final offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:**  Bob has consistently stayed around the $1,900,000 mark, and his use of ""final offer"" suggests he's unlikely to move significantly higher.
* **Profitable Deal:** While not ideal, $1,900,000 is still a substantial profit margin above my absolute minimum of $1,500,000 and considerably more than John's offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate has diminishing returns. There's a risk Bob walks away, leaving me to accept John's lower offer. It's better to secure a very good deal now than risk losing a significant amount."
