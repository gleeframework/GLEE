It's not worth buying from Alice at $15,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try to negotiate a lower price."

I'm offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground.  This is a bold move, but it's a strategy to potentially get a good deal."

Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I will reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

I'm increasing my offer, but still staying below Alice's price. This shows a willingness to compromise while trying to get closer to my target price."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still higher than what John is selling for, but it's getting closer to my maximum.  At this point, it's likely worth accepting to avoid further negotiation and the risk of Alice walking away."
