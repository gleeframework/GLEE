"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my incredible product, something truly unique. I believe its value is significant, and I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire something truly special.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering such an intriguing product, Alice. I appreciate the uniqueness of the item. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I am willing to spend. How about $1400000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is a good price, I'm aiming for more. I have 10 rounds and can always sell to John for $1,000,000. I believe I can push Bob further and potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives you a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1450000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm glad we're getting closer to finding a mutually agreeable price. Given my budget, I'd like to propose $1425000 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,425,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has moved closer to my desired price, and with only 6 rounds remaining, it's getting risky to continue negotiating.  $1,425,000 is a good price, considering I can always fall back on selling to John for $1,000,000.  I'm taking the offer to secure the deal."
