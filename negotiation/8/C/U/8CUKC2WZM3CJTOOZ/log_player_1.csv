Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with an offer of $1,700,000. This is a strong starting point, above the minimum I'm willing to accept, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters.  I'm confident that I can get a good price, but I'm also aware that John is willing to pay my minimum, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is closer to my target price, but I'm still confident I can get more. I'll reject his offer and see if I can push him further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1650000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,650,000. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my ideal.  It's a good middle ground, and I'm hoping Bob will see the value in finalizing the deal at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,625,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial target price, Bob's latest offer of $1,625,000 is a good compromise.  It's a significant increase over John's offer, and I'm confident that I won't get a better deal in future rounds.  It's time to close the deal and secure a good profit."
