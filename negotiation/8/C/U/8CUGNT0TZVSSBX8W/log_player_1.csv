Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $101. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's as high as I can go. I'm starting to think about buying from John at $120, though. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:

Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer.  It's better to take the guaranteed $100 from John than to risk getting stuck with a lower offer from Bob or running out of rounds."
