"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to make a deal at that price, but I'm not sure I can go any higher.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $90 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $105? It's a great deal for a product you already value at $120.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not sure $105 is the best deal for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $97.50?",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's make this happen - I'm willing to come down to $101. This is my final offer.",101.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $101. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's as high as I can go. I'm starting to think about buying from John at $120, though.",95.0,Bob,6,
