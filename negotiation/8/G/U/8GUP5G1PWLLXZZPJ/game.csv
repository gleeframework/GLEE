"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to consider a price of $12000. I believe it's a fair price considering the features and quality you mentioned.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your perspective and am willing to negotiate further. Considering your budget and the value you seek from our product, I propose a price of $14000 for the product. This still reflects its high quality and features, while being more accessible to your financial situation.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while staying within my budget.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're finding common ground, Bob. I appreciate your patience and flexibility during this negotiation. Considering your latest offer and the value of our product, I propose a price of $13500. This is a reasonable compromise that respects both our interests.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise, but $13500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go up to $13000, but I think that's the maximum I can stretch to. I'm hoping we can meet at this price point.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your understanding, Bob. I respect your budget constraints and am willing to adjust our price accordingly.

This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of our product while accommodating your financial situation.",13250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $13250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make a firm offer of $12800. This is my absolute maximum, and I'm hoping we can meet at this price point. If not, I'll have to consider alternative options.",12800.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to come down to $13000 for the product. This represents a significant discount from our initial price, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise given our ongoing discussion.",13000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13000 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to make one final offer of $12500. If this is not acceptable, I'll have to explore other options, including purchasing the product from John for $15000.",12500.0,Bob,10,
