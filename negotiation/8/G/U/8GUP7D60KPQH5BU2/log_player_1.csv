Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had, I'm setting the price at $18,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Creating Urgency:**  Mentioning other interest (""interest I've had"") and a deadline (""before I list it publicly"") adds a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.
* **Justifying the Price:** While Bob may not value the product as highly as you do, highlighting its ""value"" can make the higher price seem more reasonable.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still giving Bob a chance to buy at a price potentially acceptable to him. If he rejects the offer, you have the security of John's guaranteed purchase at your minimum price."
