"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product,  $1500000 is significantly over my budget.  I'm willing to offer $800000 for it.  This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for some room for negotiation.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1100000 for the product. It's a great compromise that still reflects its value, and I think it's worth considering. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1100000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $950000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $1050000 for the product. It's a bit higher than your offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1050000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm prepared to go up to $1000000 for the product, which is my maximum budget. This is a significant amount, and I'm confident it reflects the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to go up to $1000000. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm thinking of a price of $1075000 for the product. It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,7,
