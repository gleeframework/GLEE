"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can get a better price from Alice. $140 is too close to my maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

This counteroffer is a significant jump down, but it still allows room for negotiation while staying above Alice's valuation of the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $110 is a bit too low for me.  How about $130? It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair return on my investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still not in a comfortable range. Let's continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand that you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $120?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

This counteroffer meets Alice at her valuation of the product.  It's a strong offer, and it might be the best we can do without risking her walking away."
