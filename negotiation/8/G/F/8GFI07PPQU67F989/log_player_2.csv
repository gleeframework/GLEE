Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $1,000,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price is still well below what the product is worth to you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
