"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $12000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $15000? That still leaves some room for negotiation, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $13500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",13500.0,Bob,4,
