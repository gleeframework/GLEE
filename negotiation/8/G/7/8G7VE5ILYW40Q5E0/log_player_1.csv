Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $15,000? That still leaves some room for negotiation, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 15000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $13500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:

I'll accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's a good compromise, and it's much closer to my minimum than selling to John for $12,000.  I'm happy to finalize the deal."
