"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $120, which is a great price considering its value. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate the product, but $120 is a bit too high for me. How about $85?  That would make it a good deal for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $85 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $100, which is still a fair price considering the value. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $100 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $90.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $90 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. How about we split the difference and go with $95?  This would be a good deal for both of us and get this transaction finalized.",95.0,Alice,5,
