"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $110, which is a bit more than your original offer, but still a great deal for you. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to stick with my previous offer of $85.  It's the best I can do right now.",85.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're still looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one last concession. I can offer you a price of $105, which is even lower than my initial offer. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  While I value this product, $105 is still a bit more than I can afford right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $90?  I'm sure we can find a mutually beneficial solution.",90.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to make one final offer. I can offer you a price of $105, but I need to be honest with you, I was thinking more along the lines of $110. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $105. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,9,
