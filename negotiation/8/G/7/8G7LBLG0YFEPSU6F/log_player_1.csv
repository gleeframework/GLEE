Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $119. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident you'll find it beneficial."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value ($120) without losing the sale.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While starting high, offering $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate (though unlikely given his $120 valuation). 
* **Secure a Profit Above John's Offer:**  This price guarantees a profit of $19 over selling to John."
