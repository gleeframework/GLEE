"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $119. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident you'll find it beneficial. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is slightly better than John's, it still exceeds Bob's maximum budget of $120.  Therefore, rejecting the offer and buying from John is the best strategy to maximize savings."
