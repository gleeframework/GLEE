Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing the walk-away point:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, so you absolutely shouldn't go below that.
* **Aiming high, but reasonably:** Bob values the product at $800,000. Offering it slightly above that ($900,000) might seem tempting, but it leaves a lot of money on the table. Aiming high at $1,300,000 gives room for negotiation while staying significantly above both Bob's valuation and your guaranteed price.
* **Framing the offer:** The message emphasizes ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value"" to justify the high price. It also invites Bob to counter-offer, leaving room for negotiation. 

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob accepts:** You get a great deal at $1,300,000.
* **Bob negotiates:** You have room to go down slightly and still make a profit over John's offer.
* **Bob rejects:** You sell to John at your guaranteed price of $1,500,000.

This strategy maximizes your potential profit while minimizing risk."
