Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I'm asking for $20,000 to start. I think you'll find it's a very fair price considering its value."", ""product_price"": 20000}
```
Here's why I started with this offer:

* **Ambitious but not outrageous:**  It's significantly higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** The message focuses on fairness and value, setting a positive tone.

The goal is to gauge Bob's willingness to pay and leave space for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value than mine, but it's still a decent profit.  I'll try to negotiate a bit higher.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?"", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** This counteroffer aims to find a compromise. It shows flexibility while still pushing for a higher price. 
* **Maintaining a strong position:** I'm not willing to go below $15,000 (my guaranteed sale price to John), but there's room to negotiate above that if Bob is willing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $16,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering our previous negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","This is a tempting offer from Bob. It's a solid profit above his perceived value, and significantly closer to my target. 

```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong profit:** $14,000 is a $6,000 profit, which is excellent.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could push for more, there's a chance Bob might walk away. Accepting guarantees a good deal now. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal sooner means I have the money to use for other opportunities."
