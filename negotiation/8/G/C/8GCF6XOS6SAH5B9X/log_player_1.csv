Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and the demand I'm seeing, I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects its true worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate up if he's really interested, while still ensuring you make a significant profit. 
* **Create Urgency:**  By mentioning ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""demand,"" you subtly encourage Bob to act quickly.

This strategy balances maximizing potential profit from Bob with the security of a guaranteed sale to John."
