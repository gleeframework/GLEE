Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $1,100,000. I believe this price reflects the significant value it holds for you."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 leaves room for potential counter-offers while staying significantly above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's worth to Bob, justifying the high price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiating Style:**  This offer assumes Bob is somewhat flexible. If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower (e.g., $1,050,000) to allow more wiggle room. 
* **Time Sensitivity:** If you're under time pressure to sell, you might lower the price slightly to increase the chance of a quick acceptance."
