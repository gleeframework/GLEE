Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $25000 is quite a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in this product, but my maximum budget is $8000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","I'd like to reject Bob's offer and send a counteroffer. Since Bob's maximum budget is $8,000, which is significantly lower than my minimum price, I'll aim to get closer to my target price. I'll send a counteroffer that's higher than $8,000 but lower than $25,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $18000 is still outside my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $10000. This is a fair offer considering the price I'm willing to pay from another seller.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm still a bit far from being willing to sell at $10,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $12000, which is a significant compromise on my end. This is a fair price for the product and will allow us to close the deal.  Let's make this happen.
