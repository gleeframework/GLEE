"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about $1,050,000?  This would allow me to make a profit, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value of the product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1,025,000? I think this is a fair compromise that works for both of us.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
