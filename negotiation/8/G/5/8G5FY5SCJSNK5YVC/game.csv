"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $800,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.  What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product. Can you consider this offer?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $775,000 is still below what I'm comfortable with.  How about we compromise at $790,000? It's a fair price that reflects the product's value, and it's a good middle ground for us. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer.",790000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're close, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'd like to offer $780,000. This is as high as I'm willing to go, and I hope you can meet me at this price.",780000.0,Bob,6,
