"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer! I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $110. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $100? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",100.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your latest offer. I'm still a bit short on budget, but I'm really interested in the product. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $98? I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer.",98.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to think you're not serious about buying the product. I'm willing to give you one last chance to meet me at a reasonable price. I'll sell it to you for $110, but that's as low as I'll go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",110.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I'm really close to walking away. I'm willing to meet you at $102, but that's the absolute maximum I can pay. If you're not willing to sell it to me for that price, I'll have to consider buying it from John for $120.",102.0,Bob,8,

"Hi Bob, I see you're trying to play hardball, but I'm not going to give in that easily. I'll meet you at $108, but that's as close to $102 as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider selling to John for $80, which would be a huge loss for me. I'm trying to make a fair deal here.",108.0,Alice,9,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to make a fair deal, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $105, but that's the absolute maximum I can pay. If you're not willing to sell it to me for that price, I'll have to walk away and buy it from John for $120.",105.0,Bob,10,
