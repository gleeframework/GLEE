{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a good balance between maximizing my profit and being reasonable to get Bob interested. It's also a price that leaves room for negotiation if he counters.  If Bob rejects, I'll see how much he's willing to pay and assess if I want to keep negotiating or sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  I believe there's room for a mutually beneficial agreement, and I'm not willing to settle for a price that doesn't reflect the value of my product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $120?  That way we both get something we're happy with."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'll consider it, but I still prefer to stay within my budget of $80 if possible. Could we possibly come to an agreement at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $80 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Even though I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell the product for such a low price.  It's clear that Bob is not willing to pay a fair price, so I'm going to sell the product to John for $150."
