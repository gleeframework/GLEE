"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that holds immense value, potentially exceeding $1500000. I understand you may not know the full extent of its worth, so I'm willing to negotiate. I'm asking for $2000000, a price I believe reflects its potential.  Consider it a strategic investment with the potential for significant returns. Let me know your thoughts.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
