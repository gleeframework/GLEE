Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're making a profit of $2,000, which is a good starting point.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  Bob is still willing to pay more for the product, giving him room to negotiate. 
* **It sets a strong starting position:** You're demonstrating confidence in your product and leaving room for counteroffers without immediately dropping to your minimum.

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit, but also be aware of Bob's willingness to negotiate and your alternative buyer, John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $13,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, it's still below your desired profit margin.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your initial offer, which still leaves room for negotiation but ensures you earn closer to your desired profit."
