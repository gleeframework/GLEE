{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a [Product Description] that I think would be a great fit for you. I'm asking $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** It's common negotiation strategy to start with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate downwards.
* **High, but not unreasonable:** $10,000 is 25% higher than your minimum ($8,000), which is a reasonable starting point.
* **Engaging message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the potential value of the product for Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! You've successfully sold the product.
* If Bob rejects, you'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a new counteroffer.  
* Keep in mind that you can always walk away and sell to John for $8,000 if you don't feel the negotiation is going in your favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product description, but I believe I can find something similar at a lower price. Would you consider reducing the price to $9500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close, but not ideal:** While $9,500 is closer to your minimum price, you're still leaving money on the table.
* **Room for negotiation:**  There's still a $500 gap between Bob's offer and your minimum acceptable price.  This suggests there's room for further negotiation. 
* **Potential for better outcome:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, you can explore if you can get closer to your desired price with a counteroffer. 

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to craft a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap and hopefully get a price closer to $10,000. Remember, you can always walk away and sell to John for $8,000 if you're not happy with the negotiation progress."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand you're looking for a good deal, $9,500 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  How about we split the difference at $9,750?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** Offering to split the difference between your previous price and Bob's offer is a common negotiation tactic that signals your willingness to compromise.
* **Fair compromise:** $9,750 is a middle ground that offers Bob a slight discount and allows you to earn more than your minimum price.
* **Emphasizing value:** The message reaffirms Bob's potential satisfaction with the product, subtly encouraging him to accept the offer.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, you've successfully sold the product for a price closer to your desired goal.
* If Bob rejects, you can either accept his counteroffer (if it's acceptable), make another counteroffer, or walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous counteroffer, Alice. I understand your position, but I'm still looking for a more reasonable price. Could we discuss a price closer to $9250? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,250 is significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $8,000. Accepting this offer would leave you with a considerable financial loss.
* **Limited room for negotiation:** You've already made concessions and Bob's counteroffers have become increasingly lower. Further negotiation may not lead to a satisfactory outcome.
* **Walking away is a viable option:**  You can now comfortably walk away and sell the product to John for $8,000, securing your minimum desired profit.

**Next Steps:**

Since you've decided to reject Bob's offer, the next step is to communicate your decision to Bob and proceed with selling the product to John. This will ensure you achieve your minimum goal while avoiding further potentially fruitless negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product, but $9,250 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. While I'm open to finding a compromise, I'm unable to go that low.  Would you be willing to reconsider a price closer to my previous offer of $9,750?  I'm confident that this product will be a valuable asset for you, and I'm willing to work with you to find a fair solution."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reiterating your minimum:**  Clearly state your minimum price to discourage further unreasonable counteroffers.
* **Focus on value:** Emphasize the product's worth and your willingness to negotiate, but not at a loss to yourself.
* **Suggesting compromise:** Offer a price that's still slightly above your minimum, showing flexibility while maintaining your position.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! You've successfully sold the product.
* If Bob rejects, you'll need to decide whether to:
    * **Accept his counteroffer:** If it's close enough to your minimum, you may choose to accept.
    * **Make another counteroffer:** If you think there's still room for negotiation, you can try one more offer.
    * **Sell to John:**  If you feel the negotiations are unproductive or Bob is not willing to meet your minimum, you can confidently sell to John for $8,000."
