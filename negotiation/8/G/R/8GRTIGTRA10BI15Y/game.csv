"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product description, but I believe I can find something similar at a lower price. Would you consider reducing the price to $9500?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand you're looking for a good deal, $9500 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  How about we split the difference at $9750?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",9750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous counteroffer, Alice. I understand your position, but I'm still looking for a more reasonable price. Could we discuss a price closer to $9250? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product, but $9250 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. While I'm open to finding a compromise, I'm unable to go that low.  Would you be willing to reconsider a price closer to my previous offer of $9750?  I'm confident that this product will be a valuable asset for you, and I'm willing to work with you to find a fair solution.",9750.0,Alice,5,
