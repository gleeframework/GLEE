Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $149. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 149}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if Bob will pay even more. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but slightly below your guaranteed price leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring you make more than your minimum.
* **Strategic Messaging:**  The message is framed positively, highlighting your belief in Bob's potential interest and inviting a response."
