"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to pay $12,500. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get the price down quickly. This shows Alice he's serious about buying but also willing to negotiate. $12,500 is a reasonable starting point, leaving room for both parties to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. That's a significant discount from my original offer, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for you. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for further negotiation.  Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing to counteroffer.  He's confident he can get the price down further, considering his willingness to buy from John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $13,500 is closer, but I'm still aiming for $13,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to push for a lower price, but he's also showing flexibility by moving closer to Alice's offer. This suggests he's genuinely interested in reaching an agreement and avoids a complete stalemate. By offering $13,000, Bob leaves room for Alice to counter with a final price that would be mutually beneficial."
