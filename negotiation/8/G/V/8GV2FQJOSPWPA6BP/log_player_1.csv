Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives you some wiggle room in case he wants to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  This leaves you some profit margin.
* **It's a friendly opening:** You're framing it as a good deal for Bob, not just an attempt to squeeze the most out of him. 

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to keep my spending within $80. Would you consider selling it for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than Bob's initial offer of $80, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $120. It's also below the $100 you initially offered. Since you have a guaranteed buyer in John, it's worth taking a chance to see if you can get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $90 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'd like to stay within my budget. Could you possibly lower the price to $88? That would allow me to make a purchase without exceeding my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $88 is closer to your minimum than Bob's previous offer, it's still not worth it. Since John is offering your minimum price, it's more beneficial to secure the sale with John and avoid further negotiation. You're guaranteed a profit and don't need to risk further price cuts with Bob."
