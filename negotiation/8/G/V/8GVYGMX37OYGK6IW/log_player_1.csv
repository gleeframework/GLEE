Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob before resorting to John's guaranteed $150 offer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with a price slightly below John's offer ($149) allows room for potential counter-offers from Bob while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Create Urgency:**  The phrase ""limited time"" might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer. 

This strategy aims to balance maximizing profit from Bob with the security of John's offer."
