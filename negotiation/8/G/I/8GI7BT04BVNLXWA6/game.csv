"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe I can't exceed $10,000 for it. Would you be willing to consider this price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low.  I understand your position, but I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and it's a fair compromise for me.  What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I still believe $10,000 is the most I can afford. I would like to stick to that price point if possible. What do you think about meeting halfway at $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still not quite there at $10,500. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to go down to $11,000. This is a fair compromise, and it's a price I can realistically accept. Let's make this deal happen!",11000.0,Alice,5,
