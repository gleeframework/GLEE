``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's lower than my minimum value but higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This should encourage Bob to counteroffer, allowing for further negotiation. It also leaves room for me to potentially make concessions if needed. However, I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John for $15,000 if the negotiation doesn't lead to a satisfactory outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe I can't exceed $10,000 for it. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far below my minimum value of $15,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, his offer is too low to consider. I will counteroffer to keep the negotiation going, hoping to reach a mutually agreeable price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low.  I understand your position, but I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and it's a fair compromise for me.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I still believe $10,000 is the most I can afford. I would like to stick to that price point if possible. What do you think about meeting halfway at $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,500 is closer to my minimum value, it's still not a price I'm comfortable accepting.  I'll counteroffer again, hoping to find a middle ground. I'm confident that I can get a better price, and I'm not afraid to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
