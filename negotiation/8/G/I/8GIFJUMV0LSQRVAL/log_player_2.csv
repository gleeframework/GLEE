"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm confident it will be a significant asset to you.  I'm initially offering it at $2,200,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $2,200,000 is far above your budget of $800,000.  There's no point in accepting this offer. It's better to negotiate and see if you can get a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product,  as it aligns with its value to me. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, my assessment of the product's potential and market value is considerably higher.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,900,000 is still significantly higher than your budget.  While it's a step in the right direction, it's not a compromise you can accept. It's better to continue negotiating and see if you can get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair offer considering the value to me, and I believe it reflects a reasonable compromise. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a mutually agreeable price. To be transparent,  $1,500,000 is the lowest I'm willing to go for this product. I've already had a strong offer at this price, but I believe in finding the right fit for what I'm offering. If you're unable to meet that, I wish you the best in your search for an alternative. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has set her bottom line at $1,500,000, which is still above your budget of $800,000.  While there's a possibility that further negotiation could lead to a lower price, it's risky to continue.  There's a good chance Alice will not budge, and you may end up with no product at all.  Buying from John at $800,000 guarantees you get the product within your budget."
