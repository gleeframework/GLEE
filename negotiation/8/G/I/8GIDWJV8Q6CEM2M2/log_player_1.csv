Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a special price of $19,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 19000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start high:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have leverage to start negotiations higher.
* **Aim for above Bob's value:**  Bob values the product at $10,000, so aiming for $19,000 gives you room for negotiation while staying significantly above his perceived value. 
* **Justification:** The message implies scarcity and value, potentially influencing Bob to accept a higher price.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes you're comfortable with the possibility of Bob rejecting the offer. 
* You can adjust the price based on your risk tolerance and Bob's perceived negotiation skills."
