"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $8,000. I'm hoping to create a negotiation space where we can find a price that works for both of us.  If he rejects this, I'll be prepared to come down a bit, but I'm not willing to go below my minimum price of $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum price. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired amount. There's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm coming down to $9,500, which is still above my minimum price of $10,000.  This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate but also that I won't give the product away. I'm hoping he'll see the value in this price and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still not willing to sell below my minimum of $10,000.  While $8,500 is a bit closer, it's not enough. I'll reject his offer and counter again to see if we can find a compromise.  We have several rounds left, so there's still time to work this out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm dropping the price to $9,000. This shows I'm flexible but still maintaining a price that's closer to what I want. I'm hoping this will be enough to entice Bob to accept.  I'm also becoming more aware that we're reaching the midway point in our negotiations, so I need to be more strategic to secure a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a price closer to $10,000.  $8,750 is getting closer, but I'm not ready to settle yet. I'm going to counter again and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price before I have to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

I'm sticking with $9,000. It's a fair price for both of us. I believe I've shown flexibility, and it's time for Bob to meet me halfway.  I'm concerned about losing a few rounds and potentially having to sell to John for less than my ideal price, so I need to find a solution soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer one more time. While $8,750 is tempting, I'm not willing to compromise my bottom line just yet. I'm hoping that by rejecting his offer, he'll realize that I'm serious about getting closer to my desired price.  I only have two more rounds before I have to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8900}
```

I'm making a final compromise. This is my last offer before I have to consider selling to John.  I'm dropping the price to $8,900, which is just a little over Bob's last offer.  I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him to accept.  If he rejects, I'll have no choice but to sell to John, even though it's not my preferred outcome."
