"Round 1

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above my budget of $8,000. There's no point in accepting it. It's better to try and negotiate with Alice or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $8,000. This is a bold move, but it sets the baseline and forces Alice to consider my serious intent."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to get a lower price. It's worth exploring another round of counteroffers to see if I can squeeze out a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $8,500. This shows that I'm willing to compromise but still pushing for a price within my budget.  It's a good middle ground and hopefully, Alice will find it more appealing than my previous offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is getting closer to my budget, I'm still holding out hope for a better price. It's risky to keep negotiating, but with 5 rounds left, I'm willing to push for a bit more. If I can get Alice down to $8,500, it's a good deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to try a slightly higher counteroffer than before, $8,750. This demonstrates I'm willing to budge a little more but still within my budget. With fewer rounds remaining, I need to find a price point that both Alice and I can agree on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is tempting and closer to my budget, I'm still holding out for a better price. We've been circling around the $8,500 mark, and with only 3 rounds left, I want to see if I can get Alice to budge. If she rejects this round, I'll likely settle for John's price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,750.  Alice has been stubborn, but I'm hoping with only 2 rounds left, she'll see this as a good compromise. I'm still within my budget, and if she rejects, I'll go with John's offer in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's down to the wire, and while Alice's offer of $8,900 is closer than before, it's still outside my comfort zone.  With only one round left, it's not worth risking another counteroffer and potentially missing out on a deal with John.  Going with John's offer guarantees me the product at my maximum budget, saving me $900 compared to Alice's offer."
