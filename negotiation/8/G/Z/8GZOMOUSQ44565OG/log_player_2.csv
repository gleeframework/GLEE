# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the product for $13,500. It's a great deal for you, as you've mentioned you're willing to pay up to $15,000 for it, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer

While $13,500 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Alice is likely willing to come down further, especially knowing you have an alternative option."
