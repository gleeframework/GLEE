Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to offer it at the discounted price of $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting at $10,000 aims to get a higher price than John's offer while still being attractive to Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, Alice is still likely to get a better price than $12,000.
* **Time Value of Money:** Selling quickly to Bob might be preferable to waiting for John, even if it means a slightly lower profit.

**Important Note:** This assumes Alice doesn't know for sure if Bob would accept a higher price. If Alice had more information about Bob's willingness to pay, she could adjust her strategy accordingly."
