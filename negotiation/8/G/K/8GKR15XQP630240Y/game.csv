"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,500.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you consider a lower price?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $9,500 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,800. This is a great compromise that still allows me to earn a good profit while giving you a better deal than your original offer.",8800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $8,800 is still a bit beyond what I'm comfortable spending.  Could we settle somewhere closer to $8,000?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $8,800 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $7,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise.",8200.0,Alice,5,
