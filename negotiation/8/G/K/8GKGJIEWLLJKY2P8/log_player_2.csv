"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product, which holds immense value for you at $1,200,000. I am willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a special offer considering its worth and the benefits it will bring to you. Let's make this opportunity yours. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice. This means there's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to meet the product's value. In light of this, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,075,000 for the product. This reflects a compromise between our positions and aims to ensure mutual satisfaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,075,000 is still within Bob's budget of $1,200,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will walk away or counter with a higher price. Accepting the offer secures the product for a price that's significantly lower than John's and closer to the product's actual worth to Alice."
