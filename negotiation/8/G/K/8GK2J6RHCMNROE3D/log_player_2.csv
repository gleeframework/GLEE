"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll love it. What do you say?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 feels a bit high for me. Could you do it for $110?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $120? That's still a great price for a product worth $150 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Alice is meeting me halfway, and $120 is a reasonable price. It's not worth risking a worse outcome by pushing further."
