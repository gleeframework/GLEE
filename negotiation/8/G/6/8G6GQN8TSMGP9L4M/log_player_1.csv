Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $900,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit. It's important to remember that I can always fall back on selling to John for $800,000 if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, but I still believe I can get a better deal.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $875,000. This is a compromise, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher profit than Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now the same as his previous offer.  While I'd prefer more, it's a good price.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation will lead to a higher offer, and I risk losing the sale to John altogether.  It's time to secure the deal and accept Bob's offer."
