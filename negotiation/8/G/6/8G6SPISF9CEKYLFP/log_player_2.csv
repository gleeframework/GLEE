"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's a rare gem that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to start with a price of $900,000, which I believe is a fair and competitive offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still above your desired price range. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a better deal. You have 10 rounds, so there's time to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product,  $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it, which is still a fair price for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 750000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a good starting point, as it's lower than Alice's minimum but higher than your ideal price.  We'll see if Alice is willing to accept this offer, or if we need to continue negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $750,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $850,000, which is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a step closer to your desired price, it's still above your ideal range. You have several rounds left and Alice has already shown flexibility, so there's still room for negotiation.  Let's see if you can get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a good deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise, showing that you're willing to meet Alice halfway.  It's close to her minimum price point, and therefore increases the likelihood of her accepting it. It's also a good price for you, allowing you to save some money.  It's time to see if she'll bite."
