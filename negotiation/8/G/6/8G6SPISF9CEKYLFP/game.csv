"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product,  $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it, which is still a fair price for both of us. ",750000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $750,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $850,000, which is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a good deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
