"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product might be high to you, but I'm looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would you be willing to consider a lower price, perhaps around $8500?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we discuss a price of $10500? This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,
