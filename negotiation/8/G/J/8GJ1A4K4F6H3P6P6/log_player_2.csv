(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob knows his maximum budget is $8,000. He should start by offering his maximum amount, hoping Alice might be willing to accept a quick deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his desired price.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and allows Bob to potentially get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has already tried his maximum price. This time, he's increasing his offer slightly, showing he's willing to compromise but still trying to stay below his budget. This could encourage Alice to consider a deal closer to Bob's preferred price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his desired price. Since there are still rounds left, rejecting the offer gives Bob more opportunity to negotiate a better price. He can try to get closer to his target price of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to inch closer to his target price of $8,000. By offering $9,500, he shows Alice that he's serious about making a deal but also highlights his willingness to negotiate. This could be a sweet spot where Alice might be willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is getting close to Bob's budget, it's still above his desired price. He has a few more rounds, and he's already made significant progress in negotiation. By rejecting, Bob can keep pushing for a price closer to his target, or he can potentially reach a point where Alice will be more willing to accept a lower offer to finalize the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now getting very close to his budget. This counteroffer shows Alice that Bob is serious about making a deal and is willing to pay a price just slightly above his target. This might be enough to sway Alice to accept the offer, especially as the rounds are dwindling."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision, as it's still a bit above Bob's target price. However, there's only one round left, and Bob has already shown his willingness to negotiate.  Accepting Alice's offer at $9,900 means:

* Bob secures the product, avoiding the risk of having to buy from John at a higher price if the negotiation fails.
* Bob still gets a relatively good deal, saving $5,100 compared to Alice's initial offer.

There's a chance Bob could negotiate a lower price in the final round, but the risk of losing the product to John or having Alice walk away altogether is too high.  Accepting at this price is the most strategic move, considering the remaining time and the potential outcomes."
