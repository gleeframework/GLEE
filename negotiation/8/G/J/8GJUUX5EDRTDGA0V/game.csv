"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that said, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great value at this price.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about we start the conversation at $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $600,000 to you. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $900,000. This is a fair price, considering its value to you and the market demand. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below this price.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $900,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. I believe this is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while respecting my budget.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is still a bit below your target price, but I'm willing to compromise further. Considering your increased offer, I'm willing to meet you at $850,000. This is a fair price that balances your budget concerns with the product's value. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below this price.",850000.0,Alice,5,
