"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to me is at least $12000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your budget. While she claims the product is worth more, you have no way of verifying that. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you highlighting the product's value, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12500. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above your budget. While it's a move in the right direction, it's still not a price you're comfortable with.  You can still try to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably pay. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're getting close. However, I'm not willing to go down to $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll sell the product to you for $12250. This is my final offer, as I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $12,250 is still above your budget. While you've come closer, it's not worth risking further negotiation.  At this point, it's more advantageous to buy from John at a guaranteed $10,000."
