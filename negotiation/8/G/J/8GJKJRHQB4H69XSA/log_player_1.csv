"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is a good starting point given the product's value to Bob ($120) and my minimum price ($80). This gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing me to earn a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I would like to propose a price of $90 for the product. I hope this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is still above my minimum price of $80 and it's a decent profit for me.  It's also likely that if I reject his offer, we might get stuck in a long negotiation process, potentially leading to no deal or me having to sell to John for a lower price.  Accepting his offer ensures a quick and profitable sale."
