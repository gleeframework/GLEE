# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I understand it's worth $800,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from what I could get elsewhere, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.
