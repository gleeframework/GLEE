"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is far above my budget. Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to offer $750,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $750,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $900,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is my absolute limit.  If this is acceptable to you, I'm ready to finalize the deal.  Let's make this happen.",800000.0,Bob,4,
