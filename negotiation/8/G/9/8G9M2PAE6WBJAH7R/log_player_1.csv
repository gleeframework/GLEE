Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your trust in its value. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,200,000 asking price. Would you consider lowering the price to $950,000? I believe this would still reflect the product's worth while allowing us to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
