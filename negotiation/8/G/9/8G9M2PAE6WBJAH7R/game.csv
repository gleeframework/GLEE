"Bob, I have a very valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I understand it's worth the same to you. I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value and potential benefits. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your trust in its value. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,200,000 asking price. Would you consider lowering the price to $950,000? I believe this would still reflect the product's worth while allowing us to reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,050,000 is the absolute minimum I can accept. This still leaves some room for negotiation, but I'm not willing to go lower than that.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. While I respect the value you place on the product, I must stick to my budget. I am prepared to offer $1,025,000. This is the highest amount I can realistically afford without compromising other financial commitments. I hope we can find a way to meet in the middle.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
