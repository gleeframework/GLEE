"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $8000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $12000.  This would still allow me to make a profit and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10500? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to make a reasonable profit while still making the product accessible to you. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,5,
