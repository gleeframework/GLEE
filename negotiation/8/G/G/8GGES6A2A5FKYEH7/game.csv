"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe this price is more in line with what I'm willing to pay for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, how about $1,075,000?  This is a significant price reduction and I believe it reflects the value you'll get from the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,075,000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,062,500. I believe this is a fair price for the product and I'd be happy to move forward with the purchase at this price.",1062500.0,Bob,4,
