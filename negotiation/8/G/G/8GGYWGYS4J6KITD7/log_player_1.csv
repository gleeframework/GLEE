Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $60 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Bob's offer:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but $110 is still a bit too high. How about we meet at $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is very unlikely to go much higher than his current offer of $95. It's clear his budget ceiling is significantly lower than our $150 minimum. Continuing the negotiation will likely be a waste of time and result in a less favorable outcome than selling to John immediately."
