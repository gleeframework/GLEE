"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the deal, but I'm looking to spend a little less.  Would you be willing to go down to $10,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal quickly.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $10,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and the original price I had in mind. Let me know if this works for you.",11500.0,Alice,3,
