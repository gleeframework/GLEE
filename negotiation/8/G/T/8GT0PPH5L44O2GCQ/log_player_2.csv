"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

This is a good starting point. While $12,000 is a decent price, Bob can likely get a better deal by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the deal, but I'm looking to spend a little less.  Would you be willing to go down to $10,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $10,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and the original price I had in mind. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

Alice has come down to $11,500, which is still a good deal for Bob.  It's a better price than John's offer, and it's close to Bob's desired price point.  It's time to accept the deal and move on."
