"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $100 by you. I am proposing to sell it to you for $95, capturing the essence of a great deal while ensuring a profitable transaction for me. Thank you for considering this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, you can still do better.  You value the product at $100 and are willing to pay up to that. Since you know Alice values the product at $80, you can likely negotiate a lower price.  By rejecting the offer, you can potentially get a better deal from Alice or even find an alternative seller."
