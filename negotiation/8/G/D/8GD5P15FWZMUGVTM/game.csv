"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $140 for the product. What do you think?",140.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $180 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $160 for the product. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it!",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $160 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $155? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",155.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $165. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $162. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it!",162.0,Alice,5,
