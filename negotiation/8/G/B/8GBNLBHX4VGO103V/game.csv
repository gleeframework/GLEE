"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $7,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $7,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $6,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's a great compromise. What do you think?",6500.0,Alice,3,
