"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 feels reasonable. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of the product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, which is still a substantial profit for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer and for recognizing the value of this product.  While $1,000,000 is a tempting offer, I believe its worth is significantly higher. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? This price reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a great deal.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,150,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product.  Let's aim for a final deal here.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.  Let's settle this at $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the significant value this product offers.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a good compromise that we can both agree on.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
