"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's in excellent condition and worth every penny.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a decent price, Bob can potentially do better.  There are still 9 rounds to negotiate, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is a good strategy to see if Alice is willing to lower her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $12,500?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** This counteroffer is a good starting point because it is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still higher than her minimum acceptable price.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer allows Bob to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate further. If she rejects, he can adjust his counteroffers in subsequent rounds.
* **Goal-Oriented:** Bob's goal is to buy the product for as little as possible. By offering a lower price, he is working towards achieving that goal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $12,500 is a bit too low for me right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progressing Negotiation:** Alice has lowered her price, which shows she is willing to negotiate. However, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. 
* **More Room to Negotiate:** There are still several rounds left. Rejecting the offer gives Bob more opportunity to see if he can get a lower price. 
* **Strategic Counteroffer:**  The next round allows Bob to counter with a price closer to his desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,250 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference - how about $13,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product and allows us both to make a reasonable deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer is exactly in between Bob's previous offer and Alice's latest offer. It shows Bob is willing to compromise.
* **Realistic Price:** $13,000 is a price that still gives Bob a good deal, but also allows Alice to make a profit.
* **Continuing Negotiation:**  By proposing a specific price, Bob keeps the negotiation moving forward and prevents it from stalling."
