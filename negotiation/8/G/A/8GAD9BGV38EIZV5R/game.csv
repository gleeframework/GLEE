"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $12,500 is a bit too low for me right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",13250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,250 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference - how about $13,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product and allows us both to make a reasonable deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,
