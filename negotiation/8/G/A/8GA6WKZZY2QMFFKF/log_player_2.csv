Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can still potentially get a better price.  While $1,100,000 is closer to his target, it's still not the best deal he can get."

Bob should buy from John. While Alice has come down in price, she's still asking for more than Bob is willing to pay.  At this point, it's clear Alice isn't going to come down further, and it's better for Bob to take the guaranteed deal from John at $1,000,000."
