"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $12,000, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay that price for the product, but I'm not sure if it's worth more than that to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This price reflects the product's value and allows for some room for both of us.  What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $10,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. $9,800 is closer, but still a bit lower than I can realistically accept.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $10,150.  That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident this product will be worth the investment for you. What do you think?",10150.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, but $10,150 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $9,900, but that's my final offer. I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I'm not sure I can go any higher.",9900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9,900 is still a bit too low.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value while also allowing you to stay within your budget. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time. I'll go up to $9,500. That's my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,8,
