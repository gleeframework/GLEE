"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $12,000, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that is higher than Bob's estimated value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the price as ""fair"" to encourage Bob to consider it.
* **Open Communication:** I'm inviting Bob to respond and start a dialogue. 

This approach aims to:

* **Maximize my potential profit:**  A $12,000 sale is closer to my minimum desired value of $15,000.
* **Set the tone for negotiation:** Starting high allows me to gradually lower the price if necessary.
* **Encourage a deal:**  By presenting a fair and reasonable offer, I hope to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay that price for the product, but I'm not sure if it's worth more than that to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired value of $15,000. I have 10 rounds and the option to sell to John for a much higher price.  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps me in the negotiation and allows me to try and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This price reflects the product's value and allows for some room for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's offer:**  I'm showing respect for his counteroffer by acknowledging it.
* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm not going down to $9,000 but am offering a lower price than my initial offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Highlight the value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  The $10,500 price leaves some room for further discussion.

This approach aims to:

* **Maintain a favorable position:**  The counteroffer is still closer to my desired price than Bob's offer.
* **Encourage further negotiation:**  It keeps the conversation going and allows me to assess Bob's true willingness to pay.
* **Show flexibility:**  The compromise demonstrates my openness to finding a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $10,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,800 is closer to my minimum desired value, it's still a significant difference from the $15,000 I can get from John.  I have 6 more rounds to negotiate with Bob and I am confident that I can secure a better price.  I'm not ready to settle for a deal that's still substantially less than my preferred outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. $9,800 is closer, but still a bit lower than I can realistically accept.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $10,150.  That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident this product will be worth the investment for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10150}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's offer:** Again, I show respect by acknowledging Bob's counteroffer.
* **Counter with a smaller compromise:** This time, I'm only coming down by $350, a smaller increment than before. This shows I'm firming up my position, but still open to negotiation.
* **Reiterate value and fairness:** I remind Bob of the product's worth and frame my offer as a fair compromise to encourage acceptance.
* **Maintain pressure:** By staying above $10,000, I'm maintaining pressure and signaling that I'm not ready to settle for a significantly lower price. 

This approach aims to:

* **Get closer to my desired price:**  I'm inching closer to my desired range without sacrificing too much.
* **Show determination:**  The smaller compromise signals my resolve to get a better deal.
* **Keep the negotiation moving:**  This counteroffer encourages Bob to respond and potentially reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to your price, but $10,150 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $9,900, but that's my final offer. I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I'm not sure I can go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Bob's offer of $9,900 is a little higher than his previous offer, it's still significantly lower than my desired value of $15,000 and my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I have 4 rounds left and I'm confident that I can get a better price.  

I'm rejecting Bob's offer to continue negotiating and hopefully secure a deal closer to my desired value."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9,900 is still a bit too low.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value while also allowing you to stay within your budget. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's constraints:** I show empathy by recognizing his budget limitations.
* **Counter with a final compromise:** I'm now offering a price that's only $100 higher than Bob's latest offer. This shows flexibility but also signals that I'm not willing to go much lower.
* **Reiterate fairness and value:** I emphasize the product's value and frame the offer as a fair compromise.
* **Create urgency:** By saying this is a fair price that allows Bob to stay within his budget, I subtly suggest that this might be the last chance for him to get a deal.

This approach aims to:

* **Maximize my profit:** The $10,000 price is closer to my desired range, especially considering the diminishing rounds.
* **Increase the pressure:** By suggesting it's a final compromise, I create urgency and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Show flexibility:**  The small compromise demonstrates a willingness to meet halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time. I'll go up to $9,500. That's my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only two rounds remaining, Bob's offer of $9,500 is still significantly lower than my minimum desired value of $12,000.  I've already come down from my initial asking price and it's clear that Bob is not willing to meet my needs.  

Rather than risk further negotiation and potentially ending up with a price I'm not happy with, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $15,000.  This guarantees me my desired profit and avoids the risk of a suboptimal outcome with Bob."
