"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $18,000.  I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. However, $12,000 is significantly below its true worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $15,000. This reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your budget.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $15,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,500, but that's as high as I can go. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my financial constraints.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $14,250?  This is my final offer.",14250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $14,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time.",13000.0,Bob,6,
