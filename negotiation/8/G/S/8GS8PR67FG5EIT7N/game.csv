"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $130. Let me know what you think!",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Can you meet me there?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $110 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $115?  That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $115 is still a bit high for me. How about $105? I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous discussion.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $105 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $112.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it keeps the deal moving forward.  Let's make it happen!",112.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $112 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $108? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",108.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we might not be able to reach an agreement. While I appreciate your offer, $108 is simply too low for me.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to go down to $110.  This is my final offer, and if you're not interested, I'll have to move on.",110.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one last offer: $107. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $120.",107.0,Bob,8,
