"Alice, thank you for the offer.  It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $750,000 for this product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me and the market.  What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and the market. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my initial counteroffer of $750,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the market.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. However, I'm not willing to go below $800,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my initial asking price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal.

"Alice, I understand your position, but $800,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $775,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to walk away with a good deal. What do you think?",775000.0,Bob,6,
