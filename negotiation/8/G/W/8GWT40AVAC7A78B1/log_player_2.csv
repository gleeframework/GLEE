"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we're just starting the conversation, I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but it's still too high.  As Bob, I want to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $750,000 for this product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me and the market.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, about $150,000 lower than Alice's initial price. This shows I'm serious about negotiating and aiming for a lower price. However, it's not an unreasonable number, leaving room for potential compromise and keeping the negotiations open."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and the market. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm aiming for a price closer to $750,000, and I'm confident that with further negotiation, I can reach a more agreeable price.  Rejecting this offer allows me to make another counteroffer and continue working towards a mutually beneficial deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my initial counteroffer of $750,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the market.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm reiterating my previous counteroffer.  This shows that I'm determined to get a price closer to my target and that I'm not willing to budge much.  By sticking to my position, I'm hoping to push Alice closer to my desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. However, I'm not willing to go below $800,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my initial asking price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $800,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $775,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to walk away with a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 775000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price that's halfway between Alice's last offer ($800,000) and my target price ($750,000). This shows that I'm willing to be flexible and meet her halfway. It's a fair compromise that could lead to a successful deal."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. However, I'm not willing to go below $785,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I'm not willing to give away the farm. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $785,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $785,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $785,000 is very close to my target price of $750,000. While I would prefer a lower price, accepting this offer ensures I get the product and save a significant amount of money compared to buying from John.  With only three rounds remaining, it's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing the deal."
