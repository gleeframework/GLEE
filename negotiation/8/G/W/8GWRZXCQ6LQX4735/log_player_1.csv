Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a competitive price of $200. I believe it's a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling the product for $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, I have another buyer (John) willing to pay my minimum acceptable price.  There's no guarantee Bob will go higher, and I risk losing a guaranteed sale if I continue negotiating."
