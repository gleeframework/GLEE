Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $8,000 to him, I'll aim to get as close to that price as possible while still making a profit.

My offer to Bob is:

{""product_price"": $7,500}

I'm willing to sell the product to Bob for $7,500, which is $500 below the market value. This should be a competitive offer that Bob might consider accepting, while still allowing me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's made a counteroffer of $7,000. Since this is still below the market value of $8,000, I'll need to decide whether to accept or reject his offer.

After considering the options, I've decided to:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $7,000 and choosing to send him a counteroffer instead. This will give me a chance to negotiate further and potentially get a better price for the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $7,000, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than that. I'll aim to get closer to the market value of $8,000 while still leaving some room for negotiation.

My counteroffer to Bob is:

{""product_price"": $7,400}

I'm willing to sell the product to Bob for $7,400, which is $600 above his initial offer and $600 below the market value. This should be a competitive offer that Bob might consider accepting, while still allowing me to make a decent profit."
