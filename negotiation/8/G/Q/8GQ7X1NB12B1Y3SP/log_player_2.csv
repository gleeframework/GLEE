"Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob can get the product for $8,000 from John.  Alice's offer of $7,500 is a good deal, but Bob can potentially get a better price by counter-offering.  He has nothing to lose by trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $7,400 is only $100 more than Bob's last counteroffer.  It's a good deal compared to John's price, and it's unlikely Bob can negotiate a much lower price.  There is a high risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer and Bob would have to pay John $8,000.  It's better to accept this offer and secure the product."
