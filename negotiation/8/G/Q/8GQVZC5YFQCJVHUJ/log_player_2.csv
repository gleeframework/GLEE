"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. I believe it has the potential to bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a fair price considering its worth to me, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is at your maximum budget. There's potential to negotiate a lower price, so it's worth exploring that option.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the counteroffer process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,500,000 is a bit higher than my current budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it, reflecting its potential value to me.  This offer is still within a reasonable range, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.  I'm open to further discussion."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
