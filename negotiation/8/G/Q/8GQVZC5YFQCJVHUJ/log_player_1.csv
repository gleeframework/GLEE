Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1500000 is a bit higher than my current budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it, reflecting its potential value to me.  This offer is still within a reasonable range, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.  I'm open to further discussion. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Bob's offer is exactly at the minimum price I'm willing to accept, I'll choose to sell the product to Bob.
