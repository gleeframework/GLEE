Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering it slightly below Bob's maximum valuation ($1,400,000) allows for potential counter-offers while still securing a significant profit above your minimum ($1,200,000).
* **Alternative Option:**  If Bob rejects the offer, you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 to John, ensuring you don't lose out entirely."
