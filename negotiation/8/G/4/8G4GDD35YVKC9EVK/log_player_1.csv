Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and the potential to exceed your minimum.
* **Understanding Value:** Bob values the product at $800,000. Offering it significantly higher creates a sense of value and potential for a good deal for Bob. 
* **Time Pressure:**  The ""limited-time offer"" adds a subtle sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to decide quickly rather than overthinking or trying to negotiate further.

This strategy aims to strike a balance: enticing Bob with a price that's beneficial for him while still securing a substantial profit for you."
