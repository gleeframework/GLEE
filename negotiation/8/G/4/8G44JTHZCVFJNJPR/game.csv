"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I think that's a fair price for a product like this.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
