"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product but $900,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $775,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it.",775000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price.  $775,000 is still a bit high for me. Could we settle at $700,000? This would be a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $700,000 is still a bit above your target, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm counteroffering at $725,000. This is the lowest I can go while still ensuring I get a fair return on my investment.",725000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $712,500. I'm counteroffering at $720,000. This is the lowest I can go while still ensuring I get a fair return on my investment.",720000.0,Alice,7,
