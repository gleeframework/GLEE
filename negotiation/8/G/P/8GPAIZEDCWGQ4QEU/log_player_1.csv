Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while still exceeding your minimum ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 allows for a potential counter-offer from Bob while still ensuring you make a profit if he accepts outright.
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $120 provides a safety net. You don't have to desperately lowball Bob."
