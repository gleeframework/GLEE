Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to $10,000 as possible, but still entice Bob to buy.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows for potential negotiation if Bob counter-offers. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Alice has a safety net with John, ensuring she won't go below her minimum price.

By starting at $9,500, Alice aims to capture a significant portion of the value difference between her minimum and Bob's perceived value."
