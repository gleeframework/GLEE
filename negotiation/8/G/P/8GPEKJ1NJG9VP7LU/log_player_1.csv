"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that you've expressed interest in. I'm thinking of a price of $110, but I'm open to negotiation.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum, giving myself room to negotiate. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm signaling flexibility to encourage Bob to counteroffer, which could lead to a deal.
* **Positive tone:**  Keeping the message friendly and open increases the chance of a successful negotiation. 

**Important Notes:**

* This is just the first round. I'll need to analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy for the next rounds.
* The goal is to maximize profit, but I also need to be mindful of the risk of losing the deal entirely and having to sell to John for a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $95 is a better price than John's offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe I can still get a better price from Bob, especially since he's shown interest in the product.
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting his offer shows I'm not desperate and allows me to control the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll counteroffer with a price that's closer to my minimum but still leaves room for compromise. I'll keep in mind that I have limited rounds and need to strike a balance between securing a good price and avoiding a stalemate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we split the difference and go with $102.50? That's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 102.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This counteroffer is a compromise, demonstrating willingness to negotiate. It splits the difference between my previous offer ($110) and Bob's offer ($95).
* **Still above minimum:**  $102.50 is still above my minimum price of $100, ensuring I don't lose money on the deal.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** Keeping the message friendly and inviting encourages Bob to continue negotiating.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to find a middle ground where Bob feels like he's getting a good deal while I still make a profit. I'm also aware of the limited rounds and need to find a price that's likely to be accepted by Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with $97.50. This price aligns better with my budget while still allowing you to receive a fair value for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $97.50 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  We're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds. If I reject this offer, I risk Bob walking away or me having to sell to John for a lower price.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While this is slightly lower than I hoped, it still allows for a small profit and opens the possibility of future negotiations or repeat business with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll accept Bob's offer, acknowledging that it's a good deal for both of us. 
* I'll build a positive relationship with Bob for potential future transactions."
