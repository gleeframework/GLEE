Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at a steal - only $140. I know you'll love it, so let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we could sell the product to John for $150, there's a chance to make even more profit by selling to Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $140 is slightly above Bob's perceived value ($120) but still a good deal for him. 
* **Urgency:** The ""limited time"" phrase adds a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly. 
 
This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit from Bob and ensuring the sale doesn't fall through, leading to a guaranteed $150 from John."
