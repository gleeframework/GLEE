Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to other buyers. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We know John will buy the product for $1,500,000. Offering it to Bob first allows us to potentially get even more.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  A price of $1,400,000 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but still offers him a substantial discount compared to what John is willing to pay. 
* **Time Pressure:** By mentioning a ""limited-time offer,"" we create a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly.

**Why this approach is better than simply asking for $1,500,000:**

* Bob might reject the offer outright if he knows he can get it for cheaper elsewhere (from John, in this case).  
* By offering a price slightly below John's offer, we increase the chances of Bob accepting and us getting a better deal than our guaranteed minimum."
