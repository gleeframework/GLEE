"Hi Alice, $95 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product, considering its value to me. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $92. This would be a great deal for you and still allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you say?",92.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $92. However, I'm still hoping to get a slightly better deal. How about $91? That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to an agreement.",91.0,Bob,4,
