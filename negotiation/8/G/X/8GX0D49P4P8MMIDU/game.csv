"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for your product.  Let's see if we can work something out.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to accept $105. It's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this happen!",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $105 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $95. Let's see if we can find a middle ground here.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $95 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little further.  Let's meet in the middle at $100. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't regret it.",100.0,Alice,5,
