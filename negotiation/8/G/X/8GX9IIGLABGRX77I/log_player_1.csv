Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a price above my minimum and leaving room for negotiation.  Bob knows the product is worth $8,000 to him, so this price is definitely a starting point for bargaining.  I'm prepared to counter-offer or walk away if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll counter-offer to see if I can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still aiming for a price that's closer to my desired value.  I believe this counteroffer shows flexibility while still leaving room for a possible final agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still below my ideal price.  Given the potential to sell to John for a higher price, I'm choosing to go with the guaranteed $10,000 deal."
