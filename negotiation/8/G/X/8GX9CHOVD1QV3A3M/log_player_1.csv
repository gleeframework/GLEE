Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget, and I appreciate that. However, $15,500 is still a bit too low for me.

What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 16000}

While I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price, Bob has consistently lowered his offer and it seems unlikely he'll go higher. Accepting his offer will secure me a profit and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
