"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I can't go down to $14,000, I'm willing to come down a little to $16,500.  This still represents a great value for you and gives us a good starting point to close the deal. Let's see if we can make this work.",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $15,500 for the product. Can you meet me halfway?",15500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget, and I appreciate that. However, $15,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers and offer the product for $16,000.  This feels like a fair price for both of us, and I hope you'll consider it.  What do you say?",16000.0,Alice,5,
