# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high quality and unique features, we believe it's worth more than $80. Considering your appreciation for the product, which we estimate to be around $150, I'd like to propose a fair deal. Would you be interested in purchasing the product for $120? This offer reflects the value both of us place on the item while ensuring a reasonable profit for me. Looking forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120.

Alice's offer of $120 is less than your $150 maximum and a significant savings compared to John's $150 price."
