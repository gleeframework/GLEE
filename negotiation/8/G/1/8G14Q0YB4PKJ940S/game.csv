"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this fantastic product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $15000 is way above my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $8000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, but $8000 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. Can you consider this compromise?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $9000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. I'll meet you at $11000, and that's as low as I can go. Can you consider this final offer?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $10000, which is a fair compromise. If you're not willing to go lower, I'll have to consider other options.",10000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm starting to think we're getting close to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'll meet you at $11500, and that's as low as I can go. Can you consider this final offer?",11500.0,Alice,7,
