"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this fantastic product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $15000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your budget. It's best to reject the offer and see if you can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $15,000 is way above my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $8,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, but $8000 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above what you're willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $9,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. I'll meet you at $11000, and that's as low as I can go. Can you consider this final offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,000 is tempting, it's still over your budget. You can likely negotiate further with Alice or buy from John, who is offering a much better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $10,000, which is a fair compromise. If you're not willing to go lower, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm starting to think we're getting close to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'll meet you at $11500, and that's as low as I can go. Can you consider this final offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $11,500 is still above your budget.  It's time to cut your losses and buy the product from John for $8,000. You've already spent several rounds negotiating and haven't been able to get Alice to your price point.  It's better to move on and get the product at a price you're comfortable with."
