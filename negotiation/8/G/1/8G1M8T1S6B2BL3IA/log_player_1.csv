"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob ($8,000) to leave room for negotiation. This allows for a potential win-win scenario and keeps the negotiation open for further rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $9,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $6,000? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject it and counteroffer in the next round to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $6,000 is too low. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. How about $7,500? This still leaves room for you to get a good value, and it's closer to what I'm looking for. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $7,500 is closer, but still a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $6,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price.  I'm going to reject it and try to get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $6,750 is still a bit low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let's try $7,125. It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 7125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, you're tough! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference again and settle at $6,937.50?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,937.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,937.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While the negotiation is getting closer, it's taking a lot of rounds. I'm concerned that continuing will push me into later rounds where I might end up with a price lower than my minimum.  Selling to John for $8,000 guarantees a good deal and avoids the risk of further negotiations."
