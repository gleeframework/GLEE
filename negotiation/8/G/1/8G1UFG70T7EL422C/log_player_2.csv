"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a fantastic deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it's well worth the investment. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $1,400,000.  He has a ceiling of $1,500,000 and Alice's minimum is $1,200,000.  There's room to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This still leaves a good margin for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price for the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,350,000, which is within Bob's budget and a significant improvement from her initial offer.  While there might be a slight chance to get a lower price, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation. Accepting this offer secures the product for a good price and avoids the uncertainty of potentially reaching a stalemate or having to buy from John at a higher price."
