Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  The product's value to both Alice and Bob ($1,000,000) sets a high baseline.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Alice has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, eliminating the risk of getting nothing.
* **Potential for More:**  There's room to negotiate above $1,000,000. Offering it at $1,500,000 creates a starting point for negotiation. 
* **Bob's Perspective:** Bob might be willing to pay a premium to secure the product, especially if it's valuable to his business or goals.

**Important Note:**  Alice's offer is ambitious. Bob might counter-offer, and Alice needs to be prepared to negotiate or potentially accept her guaranteed sale to John."
