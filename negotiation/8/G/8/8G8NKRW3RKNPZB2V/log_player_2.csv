Round 3

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer to a deal.  I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $793,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $800,000, which is my absolute minimum.  This ensures a fair deal for both of us.  Let's seal this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

Alice has reached her minimum price, and it's a good deal for you. There's no guarantee you can negotiate further, and continuing the negotiation risks losing the deal."
