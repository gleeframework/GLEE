"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, but still leaving room for negotiation. This shows confidence in my product's value while leaving space for Bob to counter without feeling like he's getting a raw deal.  I'm also reminding him of the value to him, hoping to nudge him towards acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price that would benefit both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. While I would like to close the deal, I'm not willing to settle for such a low price right now. I'll counter his offer and try to get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which still leaves you with a good profit margin. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still finding it hard to justify that price. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? That seems like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my target. I'm going to reject his offer and try to squeeze out a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $775,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $812,500. This is a fair price that gives you a significant value and allows me to reach my target. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 812500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $812,500 is closer, I think to make this work for me it needs to be a bit lower. How about $793,750?  This keeps us moving towards a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $793,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $793,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum, but I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter once more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer to a deal.  I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $793,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $800,000, which is my absolute minimum.  This ensures a fair deal for both of us.  Let's seal this deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
