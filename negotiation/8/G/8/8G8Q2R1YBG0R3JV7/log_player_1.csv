"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  It's valued at over $1.5 million to you, and I'm confident it will be a game-changer.  My initial offer is $1,200,000.  Let's start the conversation!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows for a comfortable margin and avoids immediately appearing desperate.
* **Focus on value:** I highlight the product's value to Bob to make it clear that this is a good deal for him.
* **Positive tone:** I use a positive and friendly tone to encourage a collaborative negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1200000 is a bit too high for me at this point.  I'm willing to pay $950000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $950,000 is above my minimum, it's significantly lower than my desired price. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate a price closer to my initial offer.
* **Exploring better options:**  I want to see if I can get a higher price from Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me.  The product is worth significantly more than that, and I believe we can find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value you'll gain from owning the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by coming down from my initial offer, but still staying well above Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also value the product.
* **Highlighting the value again:**  I emphasize the value of the product to Bob to remind him of the potential benefits.
* **Encouraging a response:**  I use a question to encourage Bob to respond and continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1100000 is still higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $1000000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value we both bring to the table.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:** Bob's offer is getting closer, but I believe there's still room for improvement, especially considering his earlier statement that the product is worth over $1.5 million to him.
* **Seeking a better price:** I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,100,000, which I think is a fair compromise. 
* **Avoiding a hasty decision:** Selling to John now would leave me with significantly less profit. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to see we're making progress.  While $1,000,000 is getting closer, I'm still not quite there yet.  Let's try $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges your budget constraints while still reflecting the immense value this product brings.  I believe this is a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to compromise.
* **Emphasizing mutual benefit:** I highlight that this price benefits both of us, ensuring a successful outcome for the deal.
* **Positive tone:** I maintain a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation moving forward."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from your offer.  I'm willing to go up to $1025000.  This is a fair price that shows my genuine interest in the product, while still fitting within my budget.  Let's make this deal happen.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the deal:** Bob's offer is very close to my desired price point, and I believe it's in my best interest to accept it. 
* **Time is a factor:** We've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it's getting closer to the end. Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether.
* **Maximizing profit:** Accepting this offer allows me to earn a significant profit while avoiding the lower price from John."
