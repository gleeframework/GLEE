"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  It's valued at over $1.5 million to you, and I'm confident it will be a game-changer.  My initial offer is $1200000.  Let's start the conversation!",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1200000 is a bit too high for me at this point.  I'm willing to pay $950000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950000 is a bit too low for me.  The product is worth significantly more than that, and I believe we can find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1100000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value you'll gain from owning the product.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1100000 is still higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $1000000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value we both bring to the table.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to see we're making progress.  While $1000000 is getting closer, I'm still not quite there yet.  Let's try $1050000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges your budget constraints while still reflecting the immense value this product brings.  I believe this is a win-win for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from your offer.  I'm willing to go up to $1025000.  This is a fair price that shows my genuine interest in the product, while still fitting within my budget.  Let's make this deal happen.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
