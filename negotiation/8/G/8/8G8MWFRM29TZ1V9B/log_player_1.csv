Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to own a truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** You're aware that the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, giving you significant leverage.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  You want to go beyond your safety net of $800,000 (John's offer). 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $925,000 allows you to capture a significant portion of the value difference ($200,000) while still leaving Bob with a compelling reason to buy ($75,000 profit potential).
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" introduces a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly."
