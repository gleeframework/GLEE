"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $80 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $140 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90.",90.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $90 is still a bit low for me.  Could you do $120?  I think that's a fair compromise.",120.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm trying to be fair here.  $95 is really pushing it.  I can do $110, but that's my final offer.",110.0,Alice,7,
