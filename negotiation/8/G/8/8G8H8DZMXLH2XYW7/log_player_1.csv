Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. That's my final offer.

**Reasoning:**  Bob has made it clear he won't go above $100.  While I could continue negotiating, it's unlikely he'll budge, and I risk getting a worse offer. Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price of $150."
