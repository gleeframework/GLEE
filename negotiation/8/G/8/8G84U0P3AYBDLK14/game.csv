"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but only if it's a price that makes sense for both of us. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $8,500, which is a significant discount from the original price, but still reflects the value of the product.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $7,750? It's a fair price that brings us closer to a deal.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your target, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer you a price of $8,200, which is a compromise that I'm willing to make to get the deal done.",8200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close. I can tell you're motivated to sell, and I'm definitely interested. What if we split the difference and settle at $8,000 even?",8000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're getting close, Bob, but I still need to get as much as I can for this product. I can offer you a price of $8,200, but I'm willing to meet you at $8,100 if it means getting the deal done. This is my final offer.",8100.0,Alice,7,
