"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  However, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm offering you the product for $925,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and it allows us both to benefit from the deal. What do you say?",925000.0,Alice,3,
