"Thanks for starting the negotiations, Alice. I understand the product's value, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit high. How about we start at a more reasonable price point? I'd be willing to offer $900,000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I must inform you that $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to the product's true value. Let's try $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. While I see the value in the product, I need to stay within a certain budget. Could we consider $975,000? This demonstrates my serious interest while acknowledging the need for a fair deal.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see you're serious about acquiring the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I still need to get closer to the product's true value. Let's try $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you, and it's a compromise that should be acceptable to both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand we're both trying to find a mutually beneficial price.  To be frank, my absolute limit is $1,000,000.  If that's agreeable, I'm ready to close the deal today. Otherwise, I might have to explore other options.",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you have a limit of $1,000,000, Bob. However, I still believe the product's value to you is higher than that. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to the value I have in mind. Let's try $1,075,000. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you, and it's a compromise that should be acceptable to both of us.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
