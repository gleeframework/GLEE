{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you've shown interest in. I'm willing to let it go for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to leave room for negotiation.  This also shows Bob that I'm serious about selling but open to discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $150. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $140?  It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to make a concession."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $140 is still a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I'll need to make one final counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $130 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $135 as a final offer. This is a great price for a product you're really interested in. Let me know if you're willing to take it."", ""product_price"": 135}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $135 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125

While I'm not thrilled about selling to John for $150, it's a better option than accepting Bob's offer of $125.  I've already made multiple concessions, and at this point,  I don't see Bob being willing to go any higher.  It's time to move on to a more agreeable buyer."
