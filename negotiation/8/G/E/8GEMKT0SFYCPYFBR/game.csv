"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial $2000000.  How about we split the difference and go with $1900000?  I believe this is still a great deal for you, and it gives us both a good starting point.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1700000 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with.  Let's compromise at $1800000.  This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product and gives us both a solid outcome.",1800000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm understanding your need for a good price, but $1600000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1650000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value, and I truly believe this is a fantastic opportunity for you.  Let's make this deal happen!",1650000.0,Alice,7,
