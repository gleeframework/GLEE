Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go down to $11,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,250 and $11,000. I'll sell it to you for $11,125. This is my final offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is clearly holding firm to a price above $11,000.  She's already met me halfway with this offer, and explicitly stated it's her final offer.  Continuing to negotiate is unlikely to result in a better price, and risks losing the deal altogether."
