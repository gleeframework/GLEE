"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $18,000 is far above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $18,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob, but $12,000 is below my minimum. Let's meet in the middle at $16,000. I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, $16,000 is still above Bob's budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if a more acceptable price can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,500.  That's a fair price considering the value of the product to me."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $13,500 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $16,000 and $13,500, which would be $14,750. Let's see if we can get closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has continued to lower her price, $14,750 is still more than Bob is willing to pay. Bob has already stated his maximum budget and it's important to stick to that. It's better to continue negotiating and see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm really stuck at $13,500.  That's the absolute highest I can go, given my budget.  If you're willing to accept that, we can close the deal.  Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $15,000. That's my minimum price, and I'm starting to think that it's time for us to part ways. However, I'm willing to make one final offer: $14,750. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has clearly stated that $14,750 is her final offer.  Bob has already made his final offer of $13,500, and it seems like the negotiation has reached a stalemate.  Rather than continue to go back and forth with Alice, Bob is better off buying the product from John for $12,000, saving $2,750 compared to Alice's final offer."
