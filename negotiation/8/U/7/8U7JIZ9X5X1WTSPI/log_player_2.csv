"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is below your maximum price ($100), but there's room for negotiation. You can likely get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 65}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $65, which is still above my maximum price, but significantly lower than Alice's original offer.  This shows I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm also willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $80 is within my budget and a better deal than buying from John for $100.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee I'll get a lower price and I risk running out of rounds. Accepting the offer ensures I get the product and save some money."
