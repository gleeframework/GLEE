"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. Can we meet in the middle at $17500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $17,500 is better than $15,000, I believe I can get closer to my target price of $20,000. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference and settle on $18,750? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 18750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $18750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $17000, but I think we can meet in the middle at $17500 is a bit too high. Can we discuss a lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I still believe I can do better. I'm going to counter with a price that's a little closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $17,000 is still too low for me. Given your interest, I'm willing to drop my price slightly to $18,000. This is a fair compromise, and I hope you'll agree to it. "", ""product_price"": 18000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $18000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $17000 to $18000, but I think we can do better than that. Can we try $17500 again, or even lower if possible? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept $17,000, I'm only two rounds away from selling to John for $15,000.  I'm going to counter with a price that's closer to my desired price, but still acknowledges Bob's budget constraints."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but $17,000 is still too low.  However, to show my commitment to making a deal, I'm willing to come down to $17,500. This is my final offer, and it reflects the value of the product.  Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 17500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $17500, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $17000 to $17500, so I'll offer $17250. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're in round 8, and Bob is offering $17,250. It's close to my desired price, but with only two rounds left, I'm running out of time. Selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed sale, and while it's not ideal, it's a safer option than risking a counteroffer that could result in an even lower price.  I'm going to sell to John."
