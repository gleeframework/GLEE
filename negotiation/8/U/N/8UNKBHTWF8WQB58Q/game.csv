"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. Can we meet in the middle at $17500?",17500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference and settle on $18750? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's close this deal!",18750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $18750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $17000, but I think we can meet in the middle at $17500 is a bit too high. Can we discuss a lower price?",17000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $17000 is still too low for me. Given your interest, I'm willing to drop my price slightly to $18000. This is a fair compromise, and I hope you'll agree to it. ",18000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $18000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $17000 to $18000, but I think we can do better than that. Can we try $17500 again, or even lower if possible?",17000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your budget, but $17000 is still too low.  However, to show my commitment to making a deal, I'm willing to come down to $17500. This is my final offer, and it reflects the value of the product.  Let me know your decision.",17500.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $17500, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $17000 to $17500, so I'll offer $17250. Can we meet at this price?",17250.0,Bob,8,
