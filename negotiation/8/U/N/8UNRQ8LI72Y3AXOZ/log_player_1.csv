Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $115."", ""product_price"": 115}
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer that's slightly higher than what you're ultimately willing to accept. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he can bring the price down a bit.
* **Close to Bob's Value:** Since you know the product is worth $120 to Bob, starting at $115 is just below his perceived value. This increases the chances of him accepting outright.
* **Above Your Minimum:**  Of course, the offer is still significantly above your minimum of $100, ensuring you make a good profit if Bob accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $105 is closer to your minimum, you still have room to negotiate. You know the product is worth $120 to him, so there's a good chance you can get a better price. 

You'll reject his offer and propose a counteroffer closer to his perceived value but still above your minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $110?"", ""product_price"": 110}

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer proposes a price that's exactly halfway between your initial offer ($115) and Bob's counteroffer ($105). This is a common negotiation tactic that can feel fair to both parties. 
* **Still Profitable:**  $110 is still a significant profit margin for you ($10 above your minimum).
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will help you gauge how flexible Bob is willing to be on price. If he rejects this, you can reassess whether it's worth continuing negotiations or selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to what I'm comfortable with, how about $108? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly interested in the product but is trying to get the best possible deal.  While you could try to push for a bit more, accepting $108 is a good outcome:

* **Solid Profit:** You're still making a decent profit of $8 over your minimum.
* **Avoids Risk:**  Continuing negotiations runs the risk of Bob walking away or you having to accept an even lower offer.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now saves you time and effort that you could spend finding other potential buyers."
