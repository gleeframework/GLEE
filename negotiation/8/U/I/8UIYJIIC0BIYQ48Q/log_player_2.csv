"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $100 is a good round number for you, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell it for that low. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $105. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:

Alice is unlikely to go any lower, and $105 is a reasonable price for the product. Accepting now avoids the risk of the deal falling through."
