"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, I'm looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would you be open to discussing a lower price? I'm interested in making a fair deal that works for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $12000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your position, I'm still aiming to keep my expenses lower. Could we perhaps aim for $10000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking to reduce the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you a price of $11500. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,
