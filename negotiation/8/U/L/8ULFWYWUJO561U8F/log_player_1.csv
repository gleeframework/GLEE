Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $1,600,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I'm motivated to sell, $1,000,000 is considerably below its true value. How about we meet halfway at $1,300,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand you value the product highly. However,  $1,300,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go to $1,100,000.   Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. Accepting his current offer means a $100,000 loss compared to John's standing offer. It's strategically sound to cut losses and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
