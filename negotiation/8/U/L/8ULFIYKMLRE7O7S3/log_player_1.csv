Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice,  $950000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows for a good profit margin.  Let me know your thoughts.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $900000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $875000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you a decent profit while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a fair deal and secures a sale.  I don't want to risk losing the sale completely by pushing for more."
