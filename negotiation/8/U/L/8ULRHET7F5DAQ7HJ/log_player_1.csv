I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer. I'm hoping he values the product highly enough to be willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to counter, but I also have the option of going with John's offer, which guarantees me my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not going to accept it right away.  I'm going to try to get closer to my initial asking price. There's a chance Bob might be willing to pay more, especially if he values the product as highly as I do. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,250,000. This is a halfway point between my initial offer and his counteroffer.  I'm hoping this will be a reasonable compromise that will lead to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is only $100,000 below my initial asking price of $1,250,000, and it's a significant improvement on his previous offer. I'm going to accept his offer. The risk of further negotiation with Bob might lead to no deal at all, and I'm confident that I can get a better price elsewhere if I choose to sell to John."
