Bob seems stuck on $920,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at a significant loss.  Let's see if he's willing to move closer to my price."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really close to walking away 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000

Bob is clearly not budging from $920,000. It's a significant profit above my minimum, and continuing to negotiate risks losing him entirely. It's time to take the sure win."
