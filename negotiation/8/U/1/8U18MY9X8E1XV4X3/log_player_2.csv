"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $100 is less than John's price, it's still more than the product is worth to Bob.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $90? "", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a relatively small counteroffer. He knows the product is worth $80 to Alice, so he's offering a price that's closer to Alice's value, but still gives him some savings. This is a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about 95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $95 is now only $5 more than Bob's desired price.  While Bob could continue to negotiate, the risk is that Alice might become less willing to negotiate further, potentially leading to a higher price in later rounds or a deadlock. Accepting this offer secures a good price for Bob and prevents him from potentially having to buy from John at a significantly higher price."
