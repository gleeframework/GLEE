Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really appreciate. My asking price is $10,000, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,500 is close to my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can counter with something more favorable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While $8,500 is tempting, I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my original asking price. How about $9,250?  That would be a fair compromise, wouldn't you say?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $8500. How about we meet in the middle at $9000? That would be a good compromise for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping for a bit more, $9,000 is a fair compromise and a significant improvement over my minimum. It's also closer to my initial asking price than Bob's previous offers."
