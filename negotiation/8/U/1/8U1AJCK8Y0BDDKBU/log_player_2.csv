"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
We can definitely get a better price than $100!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We want to anchor the negotiation lower, but still be within a reasonable range of Alice's value ($80). 
* **Polite and Reasonable:** We maintain a positive tone to encourage continued negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  Offering $85 leaves us space to go up if Alice rejects this counteroffer, while still potentially securing a great deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand it's a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell it to you for $92. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $92 is getting closer to an acceptable price, we're still aiming to save as much as possible. We started low, and Alice is clearly willing to negotiate. Let's see if we can push a bit further before accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. How about we settle at $88?  That's a fair compromise, I think."",
""product_price"": 88
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're moving up in smaller increments now ($3 instead of $10) to show we're getting closer to our limit.
* **Fairness Appeal:**  Positioning the offer as a ""fair compromise"" might make Alice more receptive.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer keeps us comfortably below our $120 maximum and leaves room for one final counteroffer from Alice if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go as low as $88, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can sell it to you for $95. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching the Limit:** Alice is signaling this is her final offer. 
* **Acceptable Price:** $95 is a reasonable price, well below our $120 maximum and a decent saving compared to John's offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether, forcing us to buy from John at full price."
