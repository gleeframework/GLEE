"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not willing to go above that.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $11,000 for this product.  Let's keep talking and see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll offer $10,500. Let's see if we can make a deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,500 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile for me.  How about $11,500? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can close this deal.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,750, but I think that's as high as I can go. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",10750.0,Bob,6,
