"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think your price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $900,000 is significantly below my desired price. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000 to reflect your needs and my own. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it still offers excellent value for the product's potential.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to my business.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.  However, $975,000 is still not quite enough for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $1,012,500.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair margin for me.  I believe it's a reasonable offer that keeps our negotiation moving forward.",1012500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your concerns, but $1,012,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $990,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. Can you meet me at $990,000?",990000.0,Bob,6,
