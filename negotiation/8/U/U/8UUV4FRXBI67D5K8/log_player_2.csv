"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to purchase it from me for $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Buying from Alice for $140 is better than buying from John for $150. 
* Even though the product is worth $120 to Alice, that's not relevant to your decision-making process as you're only concerned with your own value and the price."
