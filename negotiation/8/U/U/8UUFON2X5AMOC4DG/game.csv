"I'm interested in the product, but $900000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've described, and I'm willing to negotiate further if needed.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $825000. I believe this price still reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",825000.0,Alice,3,
