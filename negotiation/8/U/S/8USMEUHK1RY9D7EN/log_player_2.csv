"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. I'll try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, aiming to see how much room for negotiation there is. It's a starting point, and I'm prepared to negotiate upwards if needed, but staying well below my $80 maximum and leaving space for a potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $85. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $85 is still above my maximum budget and John's offer. I'll hold out for a slightly better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. However, I'm working with a tight budget. Could we meet in the middle at $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

This counter-offer proposes a price directly in between our last two offers. It shows a willingness to compromise while still leaving room for negotiation and keeping the price below my maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $70 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to come down a bit more. I can offer you the product for $80. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has met my maximum budget. There's no point in negotiating further, as I can't get a lower price from John."
