"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $6500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $6,500 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. How about $5,500? Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 5500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $5500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and sell the product to you for $6000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $6,000.** This is a better deal for Bob than John's price of $8,000.
* **Bob's goal is to save money.**  Accepting Alice's offer saves him $2,000 compared to buying from John. 
* **While further negotiation is possible, there's a risk.**  If Bob rejects and counteroffers, there's a chance Alice will stick to her price or even increase it. This could lead to Bob ending up paying more or having to buy from John. 

It's a good compromise for Bob to secure the product at a lower price than John's without risking a worse deal."
