As we're both aware, this product is worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price, considering the value it brings to your business. What do you think?

# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit above your budget. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,100,000. I believe this price still reflects the value the product brings to your business, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.

You should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a lower price. You have a backup option with John who will sell it for your max price, so you have leverage."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for being willing to negotiate further. While I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to offer $1,050,000. This price reflects the value I place on the product and would allow me to make a worthwhile investment. I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,050,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $1,075,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

You should choose to buy the product from John. Alice has offered $1,075,000, which is still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. While you could continue negotiating, you're unlikely to get a better price than John's offer. It's time to cut your losses and go with the sure thing."
