"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate it. However, $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $105? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $105 is still a bit higher than I'm looking to spend.  How about we split the difference and settle on $100? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find a buyer happy to pay your asking price.",100.0,Bob,4,
