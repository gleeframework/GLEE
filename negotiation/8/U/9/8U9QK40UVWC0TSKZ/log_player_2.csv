"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $1,100,000 is still above Bob's budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,100,000 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations so far. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still higher than Bob's desired price, but it's a significant step closer to his budget.  However, Bob is still committed to getting the best possible deal.  Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, so rejecting the offer and counter-offering again is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,050,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit over budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $950,000? This reflects the value of the product to me while also staying within my financial constraints."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and the negotiations so far. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still too high.  It's only $25,000 away from the price Bob can pay at John's.  Bob is still hopeful of getting a lower price from Alice, and rejecting the offer and counter-offering again is the most strategic move. There is potential to still get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $1,025,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping for a bit more.  $975,000 is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value and my financial limits.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to get a good deal, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,015,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and the negotiations so far. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,015,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,015,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,015,000 is only $15,000 lower than her previous offer.  While it's getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still significantly higher than what Bob can get from John.  At this point, Bob has reached the end of his negotiation patience.  He's already rejected multiple offers, and it seems unlikely that Alice will go much lower.  Therefore, the best option is to go with the guaranteed deal from John."
