"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, hoping he'll be willing to negotiate. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product and expressing confidence in a positive outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't regret it. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $95 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $90. I believe this is a fair price, considering my budget. Let's find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for less than $100. I will reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $90 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $92.50. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to both get a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $92.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $91. This is a very fair price, considering my budget, and I think it's a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $91 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for less than $100. I will reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually acceptable price within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $91 isn't quite working for me.  I'm willing to come down to $91.50 as a final compromise.  It's a small difference, but it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 91.5}
