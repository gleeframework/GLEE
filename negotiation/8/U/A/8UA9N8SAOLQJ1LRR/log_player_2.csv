"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is too high for my budget. Could you do it for $8,000?"",
 ""product_price"": 8000
}
```

I'm starting with a low offer to see how much room there is for negotiation.  It's still a significant profit for Alice if she accepts."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $8,000 is significantly below its value. I could consider $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but it's still too high.  We'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I understand it's a good value, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?"",
 ""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

I'm inching closer to my maximum, but I'm still trying to leave some room for negotiation."
