"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $180. I think you'll find it's a great deal for its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 
 
The product is worth $120 to you, and Alice is asking $180. This is far beyond your budget, so rejecting the offer is the best option. You can then counteroffer with a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob.  How about we meet in the middle at $160?

While $160 is closer to your desired price, it's still above your maximum of $120. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice."
