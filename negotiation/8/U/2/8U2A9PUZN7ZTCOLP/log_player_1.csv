We're still significantly above John's offer. It's time to apply a bit more pressure and see if Bob is willing to budge."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you've made a final offer, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, which is my absolute maximum. If I can get this price, I'm confident that I can make a strong case for the product's value to my organization.

While we could push for more, Bob has met our previous counteroffer and is firm at $1,200,000. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit above John's standing offer.  It's always best to avoid being too greedy and risk losing a good deal."
