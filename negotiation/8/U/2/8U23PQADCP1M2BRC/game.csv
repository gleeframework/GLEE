"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but the price is a little high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $900,000. I can do $1,100,000, and I'm willing to throw in some additional perks to sweeten the deal. Let me know if this is more in line with your budget.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, those perks sound interesting but I'm on a tight budget.  Would you be willing to go down to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I can meet you halfway between $1,000,000 and $1,100,000, which is $1,050,000. I'll also include the perks I mentioned earlier. Is this a more reasonable offer for you?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer. How about we split the difference between your last offer and mine? $1,025,000 and I'll take it.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not quite comfortable with $1,025,000. I can meet you at $1,075,000, and I'll throw in some additional benefits to sweeten the deal. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price point.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
