Round 2
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's trying to stay well below the $1,200,000 mark.  At this point, accepting John's offer is the safest option. It guarantees Alice her minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of Bob not meeting the $1,200,000 threshold in the remaining rounds."
