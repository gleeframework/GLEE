"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great.** You can potentially get a better deal. 
* **There's no harm in seeing if Alice will go lower.** By rejecting, you can explore if a better price is possible. 
* **John's offer is your fallback.** If negotiations with Alice fail, you have a guaranteed option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **A significant drop from Alice's initial offer:** This shows you're serious about buying but are looking for a better price. 
* **$900,000 is still within your budget:** It leaves room for potential compromise.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer gauges Alice's willingness to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your ideal price.** $975,000 is within your budget and represents a significant saving compared to John's offer. 
* **Further negotiation is risky.** Alice has already rejected your counteroffer, suggesting she might be firm on her price. 
* **The risk of losing the deal to John:** If you keep rejecting offers, you might lose out on the deal entirely. 

It's better to secure a good deal at $975,000 than risk losing out and having to pay John's higher price."
