"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1500000.

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can meet your price of $1500000. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1400000, which is a significant concession from my initial offer. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential benefits it could bring to you.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value and the potential benefits it could bring to me. I'm getting close to my maximum budget, and I'd like to see if we can meet at a price that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're getting close to your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm thinking of a price of $1300000. This is a compromise, and I believe it's a price that reflects the product's value while also being reasonable for you.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go to $1300000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1200000 and $1300000, which would be $1250000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'd like to see if we can meet at this price.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
