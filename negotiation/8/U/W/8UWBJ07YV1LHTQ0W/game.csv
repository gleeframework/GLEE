"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to consider $900,000?  I believe this is a fair price for both of us and allows us to close the deal.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this price is still a good deal for you, considering the value the product will bring to your business.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,050,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it would be a good investment for my business.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than you're comfortable with, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,075,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the value the product brings to the table.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
