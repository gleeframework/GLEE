"Alice, while I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for it, as that's the maximum I'm able to spend right now.  Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 is significantly below the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1500000, which is still a fair price considering its potential.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1500000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to go up to $1200000.
