"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm still a bit above your target. How about we meet in the middle at $130? I'm willing to compromise, but I still need to make a decent profit.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $130 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $120. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal.",120.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $125. It's the lowest I can go and still make a decent profit. If you're willing to meet me at $125, I'll consider it.",125.0,Alice,5,
