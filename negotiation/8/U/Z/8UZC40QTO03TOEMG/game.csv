"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $9,500.  What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest, Bob. While I value your offer,  $9,500 is quite a bit lower than I'm looking for. Could we meet in the middle at $10,250?",10250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $10,250 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $9,750.  This feels like a fair compromise, considering the product's value to both of us.",9750.0,Bob,4,
