"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $950,000 is a better price than John's $1,000,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should try to get a lower price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a relatively aggressive counteroffer, aiming for a price that's closer to Alice's minimum value. This is a gamble, but it shows Bob is serious about getting a good deal and is willing to push for a lower price.  If Alice rejects this offer, Bob can still adjust his strategy in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $975,000 is a better price than John's offer, it's still above Bob's ideal price point.  He should continue to negotiate, hoping to get Alice closer to his counteroffer of $850,000.  He has more rounds to work with, so there's no need to rush into accepting this offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, but he is still keeping it below Alice's latest offer. This shows he is willing to compromise but is also trying to close the gap. He's demonstrating that he is serious about buying the product but wants a price that is fair for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $987,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is only slightly better than John's offer, and Bob is still determined to get a better deal. He has several rounds left, so there's no need to rush into accepting. He should keep negotiating, aiming to get Alice closer to his desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is again increasing his offer slightly, showing a willingness to compromise. He's aiming to meet Alice halfway and demonstrate that he is serious about closing the deal. With only a few rounds left, Bob is likely to face pressure from Alice to accept her offer or buy from John.  This counteroffer keeps Bob in the game and allows him to potentially get a better price than John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $993,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $993,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now very close to John's offer, but Bob is still holding out.  He has only a few rounds left, but he's determined to get a better price than John's.  He's hoping that Alice will concede to his price point in the next few rounds to avoid losing the deal completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting close to his limit, but he is still holding out for a better price than John's offer. He is making a significant increase to his counteroffer, demonstrating his willingness to meet Alice halfway. He's hoping that Alice will be willing to compromise and accept this offer to avoid a potential loss.  With only a few rounds left, this counteroffer might be the last chance to get a price that is better than John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $998,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $998,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is only $1,875 cheaper than John's offer, which is not a significant enough difference to justify another round of negotiation. It's extremely unlikely that Alice will significantly lower her price in the final round. Bob has already made significant concessions, and continuing to negotiate might lead to him losing the product entirely.  It's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John at a slightly higher price than risk losing the product completely by rejecting Alice's offer and potentially getting no deal at all."
