Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $1,000,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close this deal.  Let me know your thoughts.

Round 5
Alice's offer:

This would be a good compromise for both of us. Consider it a final offer before I move on to other potential buyers.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,250,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to compromise further and come down to $1,300,000.  This is my final offer before I explore other options. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is very firm on her price and is unlikely to go much lower than $1,300,000.  While you might be able to negotiate her down a bit more, it's unlikely you'll reach a price that's significantly better than John's offer of $800,000.  

At this point, the potential savings from continuing to negotiate with Alice are outweighed by the risk that she'll walk away and you'll miss out on both deals.  Buying from John guarantees you a good price and closes the deal."
