Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so this is your lowest acceptable price.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Negotiation Room:**  There's a potential negotiation space between $1,000,000 and $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

You want to offer a price that's appealing to Bob but also maximizes your potential profit. Here's a strategy:

1. **Start High:** Don't immediately offer your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression the product is highly valued.
2. **Provide Justification:**  A reason for your asking price can make it seem more reasonable to Bob.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique features and market potential, I'm initially valuing it at $1,400,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the value it can bring to your business."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** $1,400,000 is a strong starting point, leaving room for potential negotiation down towards Bob's $1,000,000 valuation.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""unique features"" and ""market potential,"" you provide a reason for the high price without explicitly stating your minimum. 

**Important Note:** This is just the opening offer. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You can then decide whether to negotiate further or accept John's guaranteed offer."
