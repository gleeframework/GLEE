"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I begin with a strong offer slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) to leave room for negotiation while aiming for a significant profit.
* **Leaving Room:** The offer allows for potential counteroffers from Bob while still securing a substantial gain for Alice. 
* **Open Communication:** The message emphasizes a willingness to negotiate, making Bob more receptive to engaging in the process.

This approach balances ambition with flexibility, setting the stage for a potentially lucrative deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. Considering my budget constraints, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is above my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm willing to engage in further rounds to try and secure a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget considerations, however, the value this product brings to the table is truly unique. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $1,100,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding Middle Ground:** By proposing $1,100,000, I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price significantly above my minimum. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  The message reiterates the product's unique value, justifying the higher price point.
* **Direct Proposal:** Suggesting a specific price can encourage Bob to engage more concretely rather than simply going back and forth with offers.

This strategy balances firmness on value with a spirit of compromise, seeking a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've given your proposal careful consideration, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I'm still aiming to stay within my budget. My counteroffer is $1,075,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly interested and negotiating, but his increases are relatively small.  I'm willing to hold out a bit longer to see if I can push him closer to $1,100,000. I'll send another counteroffer, but I need to be mindful of the shrinking number of rounds remaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about we split the difference from our last offers?  I'll come down slightly to $1,087,500. This reflects my desire to close the deal while ensuring a fair value for the product."", 
""product_price"": 1087500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  By proposing the exact midpoint between the last two offers, I'm signaling a strong desire to finalize the deal.
* **Slight Concession:**  Moving down by $12,500 shows flexibility while still keeping the price significantly above my minimum.
* **Justification:** Emphasizing ""fair value"" reminds Bob of the product's worth, potentially making the compromise more palatable.

With time ticking away, this offer aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing a timely agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts to meet in the middle, Alice. Considering my financial situation, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,070,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,070,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd ideally like a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,070,000 is still a substantial profit above my minimum.  Crucially, we're running out of rounds.  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob becoming frustrated and walking away, leaving me to accept John's lower offer. 

It's time to secure a good deal while I still can."
