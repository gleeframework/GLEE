"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. This way, I can hopefully close the deal quickly and avoid having to go through multiple rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me. I can do $105. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $105 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110. This is still a great deal for you, as you'll be getting the product for less than what it's worth to you."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $110 is a bit high for me. I can do $98. That's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$98 is far too low.  I'm not going to risk selling the product for a loss.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $98 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $104.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 104}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short. I can do $102. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $102 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not willing to sell it for that low. I'm going to try to get a bit more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  How about $103? It's just a dollar more than your offer and still gives you a great deal on a product that's worth more to you."", ""product_price"": 103}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my target, but I still need to save a bit more. I can do $101. That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $101. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $101
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only 2 rounds left, I'm running out of time.  I'm not willing to drop below my minimum acceptable price of $120, so I'm going to sell the product to John for $120. It's a better outcome than selling it to Bob for $101."
