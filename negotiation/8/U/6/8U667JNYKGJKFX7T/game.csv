,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, Alice.  While $14,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  Could you possibly do $11,500?  I think that would be a fair deal.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and $11,500, so how about $12,750?",12750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer. I'm willing to go up slightly, how about $12,000 even?  That's a firm offer from me.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so how about $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,7,
