It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice. Even if she rejects the counteroffer, there's a chance she'll come back with a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer! I understand that $130 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of offering you a price of $135. This is a good middle ground, and I think you'll really appreciate the product at this price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:

The product is worth $120 to Alice and we are at $135. It's a good deal and there's no reason to push harder."
