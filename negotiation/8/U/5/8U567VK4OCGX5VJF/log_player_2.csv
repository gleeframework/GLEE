"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a competitive price considering the market value, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $8,800. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than Bob's target price of $8,000. Bob wants to save as much money as possible and believes he can still negotiate a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $8,800 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'm willing to pay $8,600. Let's see if we can find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 8600}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'm now offering the product to you for $8,700. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value the product brings. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Alice's offer of $8,700 is still above the product's worth to Bob ($8,000) but is significantly lower than John's price of $12,000.
* **Negotiation:** Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, and further counteroffers could lead to a stalemate or even a higher price.
* **Time:** Accepting the offer ensures a purchase within the allotted rounds, leaving no room for potential delays or missed opportunities. 

Bob is getting a good deal compared to John's offer, and the risk of further negotiation might not be worth the potential savings."
