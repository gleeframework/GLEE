Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me, and it allows for a good margin for you as well.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
