"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me, and it allows for a good margin for you as well.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering the value the product holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product for $1,325,000. This is a fair price that still allows me to earn a decent profit.",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,325,000 is still a bit higher than I can go. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,275,000. This price is fair and allows us both to make a reasonable deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1275000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,275,000. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm offering the product for $1,300,000. This price is closer to your offer, but still reflects the value I place on the product.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
