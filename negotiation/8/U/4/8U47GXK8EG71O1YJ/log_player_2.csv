"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me, and it allows for a good margin for you as well.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering the value the product holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product for $1,325,000. This is a fair price that still allows me to earn a decent profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is still to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than her previous offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and gives Bob the chance to see if he can get a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,325,000 is still a bit higher than I can go. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,275,000. This price is fair and allows us both to make a reasonable deal. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1275000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,275,000. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm offering the product for $1,300,000. This price is closer to your offer, but still reflects the value I place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's latest offer of $1,300,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Given that Bob has only five rounds left and Alice is unwilling to go lower than $1,300,000, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $1,200,000.  This guarantees a purchase within his budget and saves him further negotiation time and potential losses."
