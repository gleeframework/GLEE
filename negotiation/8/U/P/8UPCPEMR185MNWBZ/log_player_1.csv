Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to let it go for $11,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000,  it's worth trying to get a higher price from Bob first.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $11,000 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate the price down.  
* **Appeal to Value:** The message emphasizes a ""great deal"" to entice Bob even though the price is still significantly higher than his perceived value.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and securing a sale without going through another negotiation with John."
