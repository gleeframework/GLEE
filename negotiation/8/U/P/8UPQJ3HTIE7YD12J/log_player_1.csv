"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, $14,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. While $8,000 is a little low for me to accept, I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us.  Would you be willing to consider $11,500?"", 
""product_price"": 11500

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your flexibility.  $11,500 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go to $9,500.  This is a fair price, given my budget and the value of the product.  I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While Bob is moving closer to my desired price, it's unlikely he'll reach $10,000.  Selling to John ensures I get my minimum acceptable price without further negotiation."
