Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $12,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value."", ""product_price"": 12000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially gain more than if you started low.
* **Testing the Waters:** This first offer helps gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay. His response will give you valuable information for your next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is closer to Bob's perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to negotiate a bit more to see if I can get closer to $10,000.  I'm willing to risk losing the deal to potentially get a better price than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the value.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? I'm confident you won't regret it."", 
""product_price"": 10500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer aims for a compromise. It signals to Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but still value the product above his initial offer.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By suggesting $10,500, I'm aiming slightly above my minimum to allow for potential further negotiation while still securing a profit beyond John's offer.
* **Confident Tone:**  Expressing confidence in the product's value can subtly influence Bob's perception and potentially lead to a more favorable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm still a bit below $10,000. How about we try $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching the Limit:** Bob's offer of $9,750 is still below my $10,000 minimum.  While he's willing to negotiate, it seems unlikely he'll reach my desired price.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John's offer provides a guaranteed $10,000, which meets my minimum requirement.  
* **Minimizing Risk:** Continuing negotiations with Bob carries the risk of him walking away or further lowballing. Selling to John eliminates this risk.

It's time to cut my losses with Bob. While a slightly higher price might be possible, the certainty of John's offer outweighs the potential but uncertain gains from further negotiation."
