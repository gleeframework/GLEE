{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140.  It's in excellent condition and I think you'll really like it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're aiming for a profit and $140 is higher than your minimum of $100.
* **It's below Bob's value:** Bob is willing to pay $150, so there's room for negotiation. 
* **It's a clear offer:** You've stated your price and made a friendly message.

Now, let's see what Bob does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the condition of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer. There's still room to negotiate and get closer to your desired price. You can counter Bob's offer and see if you can find a price that works for both of you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're working with a budget. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $130 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $135?  That way we can both be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Keeps the negotiation going:**  You're not giving up completely and are still trying to reach an agreement. 
* **Shows flexibility:** You've lowered your price, demonstrating willingness to compromise.
* **Offers a middle ground:** $135 is halfway between your previous offer and Bob's.  This can be appealing for a quick resolution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I think $135 is still slightly out of my budget. Would it be possible to come down to $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It seems Bob is firm on $130. While it's a decent price, it's very close to your minimum.  You have a guaranteed buyer in John for $100, which is a safe option to avoid the risk of further negotiations and potential losses. It's important to weigh the potential for a slightly higher price against the certainty and time savings of selling to John."
