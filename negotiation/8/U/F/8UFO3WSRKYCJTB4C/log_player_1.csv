"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 
 
I'm going to start with my highest possible price.  Bob may reject it, but it establishes my starting point.  If he rejects, I'll consider lowering my price, but I'll also be aware that I have the option of selling to John at any time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is a good price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value. I want to see if I can push for a higher price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway by offering $1,150,000. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but it also leaves some room for him to make a counteroffer if he's still not satisfied."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, I'm still not satisfied.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, but I'm also keeping an eye on the possibility of selling to John.  The more rounds we go through, the more likely I am to consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm going to offer $1,100,000.  We're getting closer, but I'm still not willing to go much lower than this.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'm going to start seriously considering John's offer."
