"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I believe a price of $13,500 is fair. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for offering. However, $13,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $6,000 for the product. Would that work for you?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This feels like a fair compromise.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $10,500 is closer,  I'm aiming for something closer to $7,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $7,000 is still quite low for what the product offers.  Would you be willing to meet at $9,000? This is a significant reduction on my end.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand this is a good product but I have a strict budget. I can do $7,500.  This is my final offer.",7500.0,Bob,6,
