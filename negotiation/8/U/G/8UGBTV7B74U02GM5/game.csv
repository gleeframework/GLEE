"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested, $18,000 is a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  I'm willing to offer $10,000 for the product.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 might be a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise. However, $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm comfortable offering $12,000.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to go up to $13,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable.",13500.0,Alice,5,
