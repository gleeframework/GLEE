Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you have leverage to start high with Bob. 
* **50% Markup:**  The offered price of $2,250,000 represents a 50% markup from your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significantly higher profit.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""immense value"" aims to justify the high asking price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While you know Bob values the product at $1,500,000, he doesn't know your minimum price. This offer might make him balk, counter-offer, or walk away.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** Be prepared to negotiate. If Bob rejects this initial offer, you can gradually lower your price, using John as a safety net. Your goal is to maximize profit, but securing a sale is also important."
