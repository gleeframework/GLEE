"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for a price of $2000000. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, my budget is quite limited. Would you consider reducing the price to $1500000? I believe this might be closer to what we can agree upon.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1500000 is my minimum, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we split the difference and settle on $1750000? This would allow both of us to walk away with a fair deal.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. I appreciate the effort to find a middle ground. However, given my current financial situation, I am unable to meet even $1750000. Would you consider dropping the price to $1600000? This would be the highest I could realistically offer.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $1600000. How about we compromise at $1650000? It's a small step from your offer and a fair price considering the product's value. What do you say?",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your efforts to accommodate my budget. However, I must respectfully decline at $1650000. My maximum offer remains at $1600000. If you're willing to meet me halfway, perhaps at $1575000, we could reach an agreement that suits both of us.",1575000.0,Bob,6,
