"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1,500,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price we're both comfortable with.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. However, I need to make sure I'm fairly compensated for the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me. Let's work together to find common ground.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession to $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and your budget. Let's see if we can seal the deal.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
