"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1600000 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to come down to $1800000. This takes into account your interest and still allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1700000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference -  I'm willing to sell for $1750000. This is my final offer before I consider other options.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
