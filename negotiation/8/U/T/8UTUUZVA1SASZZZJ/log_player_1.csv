"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,400,000. This is a competitive price considering its value. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This initial offer starts the negotiation at a point that is  high for Bob, but still leaves some room for negotiation. It also shows that you are willing to compromise, but  still want to get a price closer to your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're providing, $1400000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'm prepared to offer $1300000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you've placed on it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,300,000 is a good price, it's still below my minimum. I need to try and get closer to my target price of $1,500,000. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price acknowledges your budget constraints while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit. I'm confident this is a fair offer for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
