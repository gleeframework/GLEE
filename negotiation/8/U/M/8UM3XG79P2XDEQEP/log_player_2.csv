"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high quality and unique features, we believe it's worth more than $120 to you. Considering its actual value, let me propose a special introductory price of $100 for you. This is a great opportunity to experience our product at a discounted rate. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to get the product for as close to $80 as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $100 is too high.  It's better to reject and see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I'm really looking to stay within a budget of $80.  Would you be willing to consider $85?  "", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. To accommodate your needs while still valuing the product's true worth, I would like to propose a price of $90 for the product. This offers a reasonable compromise between the product's value and your budget. I hope this suggestion is acceptable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $90 is getting closer to Bob's target, it's still above his budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $90 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  I'm really hoping we can meet in the middle at $87.50.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for considering my proposal, Bob. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually beneficial solution. In light of your latest offer, I would like to suggest a price of $89 for the product. This price reflects the value of the product while remaining accessible to you. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is very close to his target of $80. Alice's offer of $89 is only slightly higher, and it's worth seeing if a counteroffer can secure a deal even closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting very close!  I'm really hoping to close this deal at $85.  It's the absolute most I can do at this time. Let's make it happen!"", ""product_price"": 85}
