"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a more reasonable price, considering my budget and the product's value.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1,050,000 is a fair price, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,050,000, which would be $975,000. Can we discuss this price?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be closer to my initial asking price.  Would you consider $1,012,500? This splits the difference between our last two offers.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, Alice, but $1,012,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $990,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet at this price?",990000.0,Bob,6,
