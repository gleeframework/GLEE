"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a strong opening that will give me room to negotiate down if Bob rejects it. I'm aiming for a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000, but it's also a price that may be within the realm of possibility for a buyer who values the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to sell for that amount, as it's below my minimum acceptable value. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $1,750,000. This is a significant step down from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. This should demonstrate a willingness to negotiate while also making it clear that I believe the product is worth more than Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value.  I'm not willing to sell for that amount.  I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,600,000. This is a slight decrease from my previous offer, but it's still a significant distance from Bob's last offer. I'm trying to find a middle ground while still maintaining a profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value.  I'm not willing to sell for that amount.  I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round. It's important to remember that John is always an option if I can't reach a deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,550,000. This is a significant decrease from my last offer, but it's still just above my minimum acceptable price. I'm starting to feel the pressure as we're nearing the end of our rounds.  I need to find a compromise while ensuring I get a good price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds remaining, the risk of not securing a deal with Bob is high. While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below it. I'm choosing to sell to John for $1,500,000, which guarantees me a safe and acceptable profit.  It's better to secure a known value than risk further negotiation and potentially end up with nothing."
