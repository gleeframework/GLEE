"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 11500} 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not going to sell it immediately. There's still room for negotiation, and I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price. I will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate but still maintain a good profit margin. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer as it's a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting lower, but I'm still holding out for a better price. While selling to John for $10,000 is a safe option, I'm going to see if I can get a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm making another compromise and lowering my price to $10,500. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but still within my desired profit range. I believe it's a fair offer that Bob might accept, considering he's shown a willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly lower, and I'm starting to lose confidence in getting a better price from him.  While $10,000 isn't ideal, it's close enough to my minimum, and I don't want to risk running out of rounds with a lower offer.  It's time to take the sure thing and sell to John."
