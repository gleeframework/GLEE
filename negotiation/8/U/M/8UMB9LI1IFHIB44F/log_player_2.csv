# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit out of your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I can meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go below $110. I'm willing to give you a small discount, but I need to make a profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
