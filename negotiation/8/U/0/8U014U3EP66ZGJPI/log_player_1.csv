"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100.  It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts at a price point that is above Bob's perceived value but still below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed, while also maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $80 is my minimum, Bob's offer is still too low and I have time to try to get a better price. It's best to see if I can improve his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $80 is a bit lower than I'd like, I'm willing to come down to $90. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still at $80. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is insistent on his offer of $80, which is below my minimum. I've already made a concession, and further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a better price. Therefore, it's in my best interest to sell to John for $120, ensuring a profit and minimizing further negotiation."
