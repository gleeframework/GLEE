"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe I can't exceed $8,000 for it. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I had in mind.  How about we meet closer to the middle at $10,500? I'm confident you'll find that a fair price for the value you're getting."", ""product_price"": 10500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your response. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to go above $8,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.

Bob is firmly rooted at $8,000 and unlikely to budge. It's better to take the guaranteed $10,000 from John than to continue haggling with Bob for a lower price."
