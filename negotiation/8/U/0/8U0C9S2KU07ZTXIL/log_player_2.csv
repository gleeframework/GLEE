"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity that could significantly enhance your business operations. I believe its value far exceeds $8000, but let's start our negotiation at this price. Would you be interested in discussing further? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $8,000 is a good price, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  He has a limit of $12,000 and knows he can get the product for that amount from John. There's room for negotiation with Alice, so rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential value of the product, $8,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $6,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 6000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Lowering the price:** This counteroffer significantly lowers the price, demonstrating Bob's serious intent to negotiate.
* **Leaving room for compromise:** $6,000 is a reasonable starting point for counter-negotiation. It's still a good deal for Alice if she's willing to make a concession.
* **Staying within budget:** This counteroffer is well within Bob's $12,000 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $7000 for the product. This price reflects my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial solution while still acknowledging the value I see in the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above Bob's target:** While Alice has moved closer to Bob's initial counteroffer, $7,000 is still above Bob's desired price point.
* **Room for further negotiation:**  Bob still has room to negotiate and potentially get a lower price.
* **Avoiding a ""settling"" mentality:** Accepting this offer would mean losing out on the potential of a better deal. 

Bob should continue negotiating to try and get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for being flexible. $7,000 is getting closer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $6,000.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $6,500?  This would ensure a mutually beneficial agreement and allow us to close this deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 6500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This counteroffer presents a compromise, showing Bob's willingness to negotiate while still working toward his goal. 
* **Staying within budget:**  $6,500 keeps Bob comfortably within his budget.
* **Adding urgency:** Mentioning a ""quick close"" could encourage Alice to make a decision sooner rather than risking Bob going to John."
