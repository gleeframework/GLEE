Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  This gives him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum value:** You still have room to come down in price if necessary. 
* **It's closer to your minimum value than Bob's:** This increases your chances of getting a good price.

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $14000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $13000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, I'm still hoping to get closer to $14,000.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and go with $13,500?  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Show willingness to negotiate:** By meeting halfway, it demonstrates that I'm open to finding a solution.
* **Stay above my minimum:**  $13,500 is still above my minimum value of $15,000.
* **Increase my chances of a deal:**  This price is a good compromise and could encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $13000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to get $13,500, selling to Bob for $13,000 is still a better outcome than selling to John for $15,000."
