"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still below my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and sets a high initial bar.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I highlight the value of the product to Bob, hoping to motivate him to consider a higher price.
* **Openness to Negotiation:** I end the message by inviting Bob to share his thoughts, signaling my willingness to negotiate.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to maximize my earnings by starting with a strong position. If Bob rejects the offer, I can adjust my price based on his counteroffer. However, I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiation with Bob stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can come to a more mutually beneficial agreement. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Higher Value to John:** While Bob's offer is higher than what the product is worth to him, it is still lower than what I can get from John. 
* **Negotiation Room:** I believe there is still room to negotiate with Bob and secure a price closer to my desired $1,000,000.
* **Potential Counteroffer:** Rejecting Bob's offer will allow me to send a counteroffer in the next round, potentially securing a higher price.

**Strategy:**

This strategy focuses on maximizing my profit by maintaining the option to sell to John, while continuing to negotiate with Bob. Rejecting his initial counteroffer allows me to make a counteroffer in the next round and potentially secure a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still below my minimum expectation for this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price reflects the value I'm placing on the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's aim for a quick agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from $1,200,000 to $1,100,000, showing willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profit margin. 
* **Fair Value:** I emphasize the value I'm placing on the product to justify the price. 
* **Urgency:** I mention a quick agreement to potentially pressure Bob into accepting the offer.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to strike a balance between staying close to my desired price point while signaling my willingness to negotiate further. By lowering my offer while maintaining a firm stance, I hope to entice Bob into accepting the counteroffer and close the deal before he considers other options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand your position, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your current proposal. I would like to propose a price of $1,050,000. I hope this offers a reasonable compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Risk of Loss:**  If I reject this offer and continue negotiating, I risk losing the deal with Bob, and potentially needing to sell to John for $1,000,000.
* **Time Constraint:** We are only in Round 4, leaving limited time to negotiate further.

**Strategy:**

Accepting this offer allows me to secure a profit and close the deal quickly. While I could potentially negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal altogether outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price."
