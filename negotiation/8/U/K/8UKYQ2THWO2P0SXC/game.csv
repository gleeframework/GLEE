"I'm interested in the product, but $900000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750000 for it. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to let it go for that price. Considering the product's exceptional quality and rarity, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $825000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $825000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $775000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to negotiate a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $775000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my original price. I'm now offering it to you for $800000. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

"I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, Alice. However, $800000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $780000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I respect that. However, I've already made a significant concession to get to $800000, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800000 and $780000, which is $790000. This is my final and best offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider selling the product to someone else. What do you think?",790000.0,Alice,7,
