Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000 to see if we can reach a deal. This is a significant price reduction from my original offer, and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're aiming for a lower price, but $1,100,000 is still too far below my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $1,150,000,  which is a fair price considering the value this product offers. Let's bridge the gap and make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm really hoping we can close this deal. I'm willing to come down to $1,135,000, which is closer to your offer.  This is a significant concession on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,135,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice's offer of $1,135,000 is a reasonable compromise. It's significantly lower than her initial offer and a decent saving compared to John's price. Continuing to negotiate might not yield a much better result, and there's a risk Alice might not go much lower."
