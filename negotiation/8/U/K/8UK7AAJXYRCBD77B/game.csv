"Bob, I'm happy to offer you this amazing product at a price that reflects its value. My initial offer is $1,400,000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $1,400,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000 to see if we can reach a deal. This is a significant price reduction from my original offer, and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,100,000. Would that work for you?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're aiming for a lower price, but $1,100,000 is still too far below my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $1,150,000,  which is a fair price considering the value this product offers. Let's bridge the gap and make this deal happen.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000?  It seems like a fair compromise.",1125000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really hoping we can close this deal. I'm willing to come down to $1,135,000, which is closer to your offer.  This is a significant concession on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",1135000.0,Alice,7,
