Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $800,000, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. If he rejects this initial offer, I'll carefully consider his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly, keeping in mind the possibility of selling to John for $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, it's still worth exploring if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $900,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer a higher price,  Bob's offer of $850,000 is a reasonable compromise.  It's higher than what John would pay and significantly closer to my initial asking price. Accepting this offer ensures a good profit and avoids the risk of further negotiations."
