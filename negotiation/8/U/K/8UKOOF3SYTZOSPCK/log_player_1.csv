Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth no less than $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,750,000.  This is a significant opportunity, and I believe the product's potential benefits far outweigh the price. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $1,750,000 is a reasonable starting point. It's higher than my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested.
* **Message:**  The message is positive and highlights the potential value for Bob. It doesn't reveal my minimum price, keeping some leverage. 
* **Risk:**  I'm willing to take a risk by offering a price higher than my minimum, but this is a calculated risk to potentially maximize profit.

**Reasoning:**

I'm trying to balance maximizing my profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. By offering a price slightly higher than my minimum, I aim to incentivize Bob to accept while still maintaining a profitable deal. If Bob rejects, I can fall back on John's offer, guaranteeing me a decent profit."
