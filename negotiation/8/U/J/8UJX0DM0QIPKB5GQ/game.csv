"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to commit to that price. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, given its value to me. I believe this is a fair price considering its current market value and your desire to sell it. Let's find a mutually agreeable solution.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,150,000. This price still reflects a significant discount from the product's true worth, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not able to meet your price.  Given my budget constraints, I'm only able to offer $1,100,000. This reflects a substantial reduction from your initial asking price and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,100,000. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $1,125,000. This price is closer to your offer, but still reflects the product's true worth. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
