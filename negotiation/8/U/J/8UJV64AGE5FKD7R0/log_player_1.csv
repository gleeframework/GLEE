# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer and the potential of this asset,  $1500000 is unfortunately out of my budget range. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it, considering your stated minimum value. I'm confident this would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
