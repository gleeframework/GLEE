"Bob, I'm offering you the chance to acquire a truly unique and valuable asset. While I cannot disclose the specifics at this stage, let's just say it's worth a minimum of $1000000 to me.  I'm confident it holds significant potential for you as well.  I'm willing to part with it for a price of $1500000. Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer and the potential of this asset,  $1500000 is unfortunately out of my budget range. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it, considering your stated minimum value. I'm confident this would be a fair price for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your interest. While I value your offer, it falls a bit short of what I'm aiming for. I'm willing to come down a little and offer the product to you for $1250000. This price reflects a compromise and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1250000 is still slightly over my budget. I'm prepared to pay $1150000 for the product. This price is closer to your minimum value and allows for a transaction that benefits both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
