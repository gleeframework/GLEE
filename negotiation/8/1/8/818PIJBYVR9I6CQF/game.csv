"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's a significant discount from the value I place on it. I'm confident you'll see the potential in this opportunity. Let me know your thoughts!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I place on the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows us both to profit from this transaction. Let's meet in the middle on this.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,000,000. How about we settle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit too far from where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $975,000. This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to move forward with this transaction.  Let me know your thoughts.",975000.0,Alice,5,
