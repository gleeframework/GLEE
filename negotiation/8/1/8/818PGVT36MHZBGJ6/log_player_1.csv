Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal considering its value to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate and makes him more likely to engage.
* **It's below your minimum value:**  This ensures you still profit if Bob accepts the offer.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:**  It allows for a back-and-forth negotiation, potentially leading to a higher price for you.

Remember, you can always fall back on selling to John for $150 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I am only willing to pay up to $100 for the product. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below your minimum desired price of $150. Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to:

* **Maintain leverage:** By rejecting, you show Bob you're not desperate for a quick sale and are willing to negotiate.
* **Explore higher offers:** You can counteroffer and try to get closer to your desired price.
* **Fall back on John:** If negotiations with Bob fail, you can still sell to John for a guaranteed $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $120. Would you be willing to meet me halfway there? "", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while still being significantly higher than Bob's offer.
* **Emphasis on compromise:** The message emphasizes a willingness to negotiate further, suggesting a possible deal could be reached.
* **Maintaining your minimum:** This offer is still above your minimum value, ensuring you still make a profit even if Bob accepts.

Remember, you can always fall back on selling to John for $150 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. Let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is closer to your minimum desired price, it's still below the $120 you're aiming for. By rejecting Bob's offer, you:

* **Maintain leverage:**  Show Bob you're still willing to negotiate for a higher price.
* **Signal your value:** Demonstrate that you believe the product is worth more than $110.
* **Increase the possibility of a better deal:** You have the opportunity to make another counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to your desired $120 or even higher.
* **Retain the option to sell to John:**  You can still choose to sell to John for $150 if negotiations with Bob break down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your position, $110 is still a bit low for me. Would you consider $115? This would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** This counteroffer shows a small concession from your previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to work towards a deal.
* **Fair Compromise:**  The message frames the offer as a fair compromise, appealing to Bob's sense of reason and potentially increasing his chances of accepting.
* **Near Your Minimum:**  $115 is close to your minimum desired price, ensuring you're still getting a reasonable profit if Bob accepts.
* **Opportunity for Agreement:**  This final offer leaves room for Bob to agree, potentially closing the deal and avoiding the need to sell to John. 

Remember, if Bob rejects this offer, you can always choose to sell to John for $150."
