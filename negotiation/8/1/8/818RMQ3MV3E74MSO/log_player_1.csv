"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value but still lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a strong starting position.
* **Clear Communication:** I'm being direct and stating the price clearly. I'm also offering a reason for the price, acknowledging the value Bob perceives in the product. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message ends by asking for Bob's thoughts, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. 

This approach aims to get the negotiation started in a positive direction while leaving room for adjustments based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price, considering the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While it's tempting to accept given the time constraint, I'm aiming for a higher price. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimizing Loss:**  Accepting Bob's offer would result in a substantial loss compared to my minimum target.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. I can counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum, potentially reaching a compromise.
* **Time Pressure:** While I have limited rounds, I'm willing to risk a few rounds to try and get a better price. 

I'm confident that I can achieve a better outcome by continuing the negotiation, even if it means potentially reaching a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is still a significant discount from my original offer. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair compromise. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm stating a firm price but acknowledging Bob's perspective by calling it a ""compromise."" This approach helps maintain a positive tone.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm emphasizing the discount from my original price, implying a fair deal for Bob. 
* **Finality:**  Stating it's my ""final offer"" creates a sense of urgency and pressure for Bob to consider.

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between firmness and flexibility. It's a significant reduction from my original price, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate, while still remaining above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired target. I'm not willing to settle for this price yet, as I believe there's still room for negotiation.

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  The remaining rounds are becoming limited, but I'm willing to risk a few more to try and reach a higher price.
* **Negotiation Potential:** Bob's ""final offer"" statement is likely a tactic. I can counteroffer with a slightly higher price, demonstrating my flexibility while still aiming for a better outcome.
* **Avoiding Loss:**  Accepting Bob's offer would still result in a significant loss compared to my ideal selling price.

I believe that by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, I can potentially achieve a more favorable price and minimize my financial loss."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's meet halfway. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price for both of us. I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth every penny. Let me know your final decision."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between Bob's last offer and my previous offer. This shows I'm willing to meet him in the middle while maintaining a higher price.
* **Value Justification:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product, emphasizing that $1,300,000 is a good deal considering its worth.
* **Finality (Again):** I'm using the phrase ""final decision"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to make a decision.

This counteroffer is a compromise that demonstrates flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my minimum. It's a calculated risk, but with only five rounds left, I need to start moving towards a resolution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,280,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired target. With only four rounds left, I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly lower than what I could potentially get from John.

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  The remaining rounds are becoming increasingly limited, but I'm still confident that I can get a better price.
* **Negotiation Potential:** Bob's ""final offer"" statement is likely a tactic. I can counteroffer with a slightly higher price, demonstrating my flexibility while still aiming for a better outcome.
* **Avoiding Loss:**  Accepting Bob's offer would still result in a substantial loss compared to what I could potentially earn from John.

I believe that by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, I can potentially achieve a more favorable price. This decision is a calculated risk, but I believe the potential reward outweighs the potential of losing a few rounds."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but $1,280,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,290,000, but that's my final offer.  I'm confident you'll find this product to be a valuable asset, and this price reflects its worth.  It's time to make a decision, Bob. Are we in agreement?"", ""product_price"": 1290000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Finality (Again):** Emphasizing ""final offer"" increases the pressure on Bob to accept or walk away.
* **Small Concession:**  A small reduction shows flexibility while remaining above my minimum.
* **Value Reiteration:**  Reminding Bob of the product's value strengthens the case for the price.

**Strategy:** 

With limited rounds left, this counteroffer aims to push Bob towards acceptance.  It's a small concession, but it could be enough to close the deal.  If rejected, I'll be ready to sell to John in the next round if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price for your product, but I'm afraid $1,290,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $1,260,000 for the product. This is my last offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,260,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,260,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and with only two rounds left, the risk of not reaching an agreement is high.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm not willing to risk losing this sale altogether.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  Two rounds remaining means very limited negotiation space.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Selling to John ensures a guaranteed profit that meets my minimum target.
* **Avoiding Loss:**  Rejecting Bob's offer could result in the negotiation failing, leaving me with no sale and a significant financial loss. 

Although I would have preferred to get a higher price, the certainty of selling to John for $1,500,000 outweighs the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob."
