Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like that you're willing to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still not quite there. I can do $17,000, and that's as low as I can go. I'm starting to think about other buyers, though...

It's time to cut our losses. Alice is clearly not budging much, and we have a guaranteed option with John at $15,000. It's not worth the risk of Alice's price going up even further or her finding another buyer."
