"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm initially offering it for $2,200,000."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Starting significantly above your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""incredible value and potential"" subtly justifies the high price without revealing the product's true worth to you. 
* **Openness to Negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and encourages further discussion, signaling that you are open to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Profit:**  If Bob accepts, you secure a price much higher than your minimum.
2. **Gather Information:**  Bob's reaction (acceptance, a strong counteroffer, or a weak counteroffer) will provide valuable insight into his perceived value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below your minimum. You have plenty of rounds left to negotiate, and selling to John right now would mean leaving potential profit on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge and Counter:** You acknowledge Bob's offer but stand firm that it's too low.
* **Strategic Concession:** You make a substantial decrease from your initial offer to show flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Hold Ground:** The new price of $1,900,000 keeps you well above your minimum and signals that you're serious about getting a fair price. 

This approach maintains a balance between moving towards a potential deal and not undervaluing your product. It will be interesting to see how Bob responds to this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product is valuable, but $1,900,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,500,000. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has met your absolute minimum price. While you could try to push for more, it's risky.  Here's why:

* **Bob's Limit:**  His offer of $1,500,000, framed as ""meeting in the middle,"" suggests he's nearing his maximum.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Pushing further could make Bob walk away, leaving you to sell to John at the same price. Accepting now secures the known good outcome. 
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation and potential delays."
