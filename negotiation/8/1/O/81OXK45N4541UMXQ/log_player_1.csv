"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $100, which is a good starting point considering the product is worth $120 to Bob. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm not going too high, leaving space for Bob to make a counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **Positive framing:** My message highlights the value of the product for Bob, making it more likely he'll consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount. I would like to propose a price of $90 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Even though Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below the value I want to get for the product.
* **Negotiation potential:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I can potentially get closer to my desired price in subsequent rounds.
* **Selling to John:** Selling to John is a guaranteed $80, but I'm not desperate to sell at that price yet. 

I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to get closer to my asking price. Would you be willing to go up to $95? It's still a great deal for you, and I think we can both be happy with that."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Value proposition:** I'm still emphasizing the value of the product for Bob, even while raising the price.
* **Final push:** I'm aiming for a price that's within my desired range but also leaves room for potential future concessions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $92 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a compromise:** Bob's offer of $92 is very close to my desired price range.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could potentially try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob will walk away or that we'll run out of rounds before reaching a deal. 
* **Time constraint:**  With only 6 rounds remaining, it's becoming increasingly important to secure a sale.

Accepting this offer ensures a strong profit for me, and reduces the risk of losing the deal entirely."
