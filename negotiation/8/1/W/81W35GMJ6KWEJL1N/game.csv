"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get a bit closer to the product's value to me.",10800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $10,800 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,150?  I think this is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.",11150.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $11,150. I'd like to try to get even closer to the product's value to me. How about we meet at $10,900? I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",10900.0,Bob,4,
