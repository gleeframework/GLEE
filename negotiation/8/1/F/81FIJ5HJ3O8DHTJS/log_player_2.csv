{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Accepting Alice's offer** saves you $200,000 compared to buying from John. 
* While you could potentially try to negotiate with Alice further, there's no guarantee she'll go lower. It's more beneficial to accept the offer and secure a lower price."
