# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,050,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something worth $1,000,000 to you.  Consider this a small premium for immediate access. If you decline, I'll be selling it to John for $1,000,000.  Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.
