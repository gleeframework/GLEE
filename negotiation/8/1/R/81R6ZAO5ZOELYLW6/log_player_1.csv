"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm initially offering it at $22,000."", ""product_price"": 22000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to start negotiations higher than your desired outcome. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $22,000, you're setting a high anchor point in Bob's mind. This might make your later concessions seem more significant.
* **Leaving Room:** The $22,000 price point leaves a lot of room to negotiate downwards while still staying above your minimum acceptable price of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $22,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is below your minimum acceptable price of $15,000. You have a guaranteed offer from John at $15,000, so accepting Bob's offer would be losing out on potential profit. It's time to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob. However, $14,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. To be fair to both of us, how about we meet in the middle at $19,000?"", ""product_price"": 19000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Decrease but Above Minimum:** While still above your $15,000 minimum, the $19,000 counteroffer is a substantial decrease from your initial offer. This signals flexibility on your part while demonstrating that you're serious about finding a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Middle Ground:** Suggesting to ""meet in the middle"" positions the counteroffer as a fair compromise, potentially making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Maintaining Room for Negotiation:** The $19,000 price point leaves you with some wiggle room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. How about we try to find a sweet spot at $16,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum, Close to John's Offer:** Bob's offer of $16,500 is above your $15,000 minimum. While you could get $15,000 from John, the extra $1,500 from Bob makes it worthwhile to accept. 
* **Time Value:**  Every round that passes without a deal means a delay in getting paid. Accepting now secures the sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
