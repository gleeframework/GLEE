Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 (John), you can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob. This maximizes your potential profit.
* **Justification for Value:** The message subtly hints at the product's high value and potential, aiming to justify the high price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial price is ambitious, it leaves room for Bob to negotiate. If Bob counters, you can always move closer to your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000."
