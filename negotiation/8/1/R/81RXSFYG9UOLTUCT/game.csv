"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it.  Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $120 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $150, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle!",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $150 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $135. How about we meet in the middle?",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $135 is still a bit below my minimum.  How about we split the difference at $142.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",142.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $142.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet at $138.75? It's a small difference from your last offer, and it's closer to my limit.",138.75,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer!  $138.75 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to go down to $140.50.  This is my final offer, let's see if we can close the deal.",140.5,Alice,7,
