Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts, as I believe this is a worthwhile investment for someone like you."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, starting with a price of $1,500,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming high. 
* **Confident Language:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""confident it will exceed your expectations"" are designed to increase the perceived value.
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating why the price is so high, mentioning the ""value and potential"" hints at significant benefits, potentially justifying the cost in Bob's mind.
* **Safety net:**  Even if Bob rejects the offer, we have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000 to John. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Depending on your negotiation style and how much you want to risk losing the sale to Bob, you could offer a lower price."
