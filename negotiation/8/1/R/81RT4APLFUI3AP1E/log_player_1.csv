This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price higher than your minimum but still potentially attractive to Bob.  It leaves room for negotiation while also signaling your confidence in the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to try to get a better deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,100,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to try to get closer to my target price. How about we meet in the middle at $1200000?

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  It's in my best interest to accept this offer and avoid the risk of further negotiation or having to sell to John for the same amount."
