"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's an exclusive opportunity that I believe would greatly benefit you.

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market price.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your perspective and respect your valuation of the product. In light of that, I am willing to consider your offer. However, I must maintain a minimum profit margin for the transaction. Therefore, I propose a price of $8,800 for the product.",8800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to consider my previous offer, Alice. However, $8,800 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm proposing a price of $8,400 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that works for both of us.",8400.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your continued effort to find a mutually beneficial price, Alice. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $8,400, but I'd like to see if we can meet at $8,300. I believe this is a fair price that would allow us to complete the transaction.",8300.0,Bob,6,
