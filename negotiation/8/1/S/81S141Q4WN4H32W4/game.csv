"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $22,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit high for me though.  I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However, $8,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $19,000.  This is my final offer.",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product but $19,000 is still too steep for me. Would you consider $12,000?  It's a fair offer.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation. While $12,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I still can't let it go for less than $16,000. This product will really make a difference for you.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  How about we split the difference and do $14,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",14000.0,Bob,6,
