"Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its market value and significantly above my minimum acceptable price.  Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $1,000,000 is a good offer, it's still a bit below what I'm aiming for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer, and is a fair price given the value of this product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,100,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
