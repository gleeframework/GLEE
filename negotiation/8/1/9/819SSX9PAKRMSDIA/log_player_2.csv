Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,125,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. What are your thoughts?

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $900,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding firm, and her ""final offer"" is still above John's price. While we could continue negotiating, it's unlikely Alice will go much lower.  At this point, it's more strategic to cut our losses and buy from John for the guaranteed $1,000,000."
