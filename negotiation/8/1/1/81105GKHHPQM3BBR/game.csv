"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market rate. I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the value, however, I need to be closer to $1,700,000 for this to make sense for me. Would you be willing to meet in that range?",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that takes into account the product's value and your needs. I'm open to further negotiations if necessary.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
