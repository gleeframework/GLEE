,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?  This product is truly worth it.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $12,000 is still above what I'm comfortable spending.  How about $10,500? That's a fair compromise.",10500.0,Bob,4,
