"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant return on investment you'll see. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is far too high.  It's best to reject and counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate the product's potential, $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 undervalues the product significantly. I've done extensive research and analysis, and I'm confident it can generate far more return for you. How about we meet halfway and settle on $1,900,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still too high. It's worth trying another counteroffer to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still a significant stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which represents a considerable investment on my part.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price.  To be frank, $1,000,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. I believe this price fairly reflects the value you'll be gaining. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is getting closer, it's still outside my budget.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap.  If she rejects, I'll buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,600,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  If we can't find common ground here, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a solution here. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's final offer is still too high. While we're getting closer, it's time to move on. John's offer is a much better deal for me, and I'm confident I can find value in the product even at that price."
