Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic deal on this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $20,000. This is a limited-time offer, so let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $8,000, you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000. This gives you leverage to start with a higher asking price. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  A starting price of $20,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still landing within a range that's profitable for you.
* **Sense of Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob and the ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency.

**Important Note:**  It's unlikely Bob will accept $20,000 outright. However, this strategy aims to maximize potential profit by opening negotiations from a strong position.  You can always adjust your price downwards if Bob counters, knowing you have John as a backup buyer."
