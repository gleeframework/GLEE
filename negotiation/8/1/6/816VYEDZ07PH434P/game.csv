"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a game-changer, and I know you'll find it extremely valuable. I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial deal.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I agree this product is valuable, but that price is a little high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $800,000 is significantly below the product's value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,200,000 is getting closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you consider $950,000? That's a significant offer.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and your potential gain. Let's close this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle at $1,025,000? That seems like a fair compromise to me.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
