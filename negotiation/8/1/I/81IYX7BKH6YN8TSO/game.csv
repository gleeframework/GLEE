"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider $8,000? I believe it's a fair price.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $8,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $10,500. It's still a great deal, considering the product's value and rarity. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. $10,500 is still a bit too steep for me.  How about we split the difference from our last offers and settle at $9,250?",9250.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our last offers, so I'll counter with $10,750. It's a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10750.0,Alice,5,
