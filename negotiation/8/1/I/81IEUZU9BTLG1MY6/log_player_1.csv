Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $18,000.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still reach a price that's beneficial for you. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly hint that the price is justified without explicitly stating why it's worth that much to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Phrases like ""initially proposing"" and ""what are your thoughts"" signal that you're open to discussing the price and potentially meeting somewhere in the middle.

**Important Note:**  While you have a guaranteed sale with John, aiming higher with Bob might lead to a better outcome. However, be prepared to potentially lower your price slightly if Bob shows resistance but seems genuinely interested."
