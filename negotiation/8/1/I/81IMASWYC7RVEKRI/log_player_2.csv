"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than Alice's valuation, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  There's room for negotiation, and Bob can try to get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still within Bob's budget, and it's getting closer to his desired price.  While he could continue negotiating, the risk is that Alice will reject his counteroffer and he'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting the offer is the most logical choice to secure the product while still getting a decent deal."
