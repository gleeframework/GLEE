{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you'll get a significant value, and I'll be able to move it quickly. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than Bob's perceived value, giving me some room to negotiate, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer in a positive way, highlighting the value for both of us. This helps build rapport and encourages a response from Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've secured a good sale.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll analyze his counteroffer and either accept if it's reasonable or make a new counteroffer.
* **If negotiations stall:** I'll consider selling to John for $1,200,000 as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.** While it's closer to my desired price, it's still not enough to make the deal worthwhile. 
* **I want to see if I can get closer to my target price by counter-offering.**  I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can push Bob further. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer to Bob:** I'll aim for a price between $900,000 and $1,200,000. I'll need to weigh the risk of losing Bob completely against the potential for a better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about we split the difference and go with $950,000? That way, we both get a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm counteroffering with $950,000, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise, while still aiming for a price closer to my desired outcome.
* **Message:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone, emphasizing the ""good deal"" for both of us. This helps keep the negotiation amicable and avoids a stalemate.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  I've secured a good deal with a price that is closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll need to consider carefully whether to continue negotiating with Bob or move on to John. I'll need to factor in the risk of losing Bob entirely, but also the potential for a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still trying to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.** While it's a slight increase from his previous offer, it's not enough to make the deal worthwhile.
* **I want to explore my options further.** I believe I can still potentially secure a better price from Bob, but I also need to consider the time and effort involved in continued negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer to Bob:** I'll need to carefully consider my next move. I could counteroffer with a price slightly higher than Bob's, but it's important to consider if further negotiations are worthwhile.
* **Sell to John?:** I need to weigh the potential of securing a higher price from Bob against the guaranteed sale to John at $1,200,000. This decision depends on my risk tolerance and the time constraints I have."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $920,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $940,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's fair for both of us. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 940000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm counteroffering with $940,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer. This shows a willingness to meet halfway, while still being closer to my desired price. 
* **Message:** I'm using a firm but polite tone, indicating that this is my final offer.  I'm also emphasizing the fairness of the deal to encourage Bob to accept.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've secured a good deal with a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll need to weigh my options carefully. If I believe Bob is unlikely to accept a higher price, I'll likely sell to John for the guaranteed $1,200,000. However, if I feel there's still a chance of getting a better deal with Bob, I might be willing to continue negotiating."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is well below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.**  Further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to get me closer to my desired price.
* **I've reached a point where the risk of losing Bob entirely outweighs the potential for a higher price.**  While I'd prefer to get closer to my minimum, John's offer provides a guaranteed sale at a price that meets my requirements.

**Next Steps:**

* **Sell to John:**  I will accept John's offer and sell the product to him for $1,200,000. This ensures I get a fair price for the product and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiations with Bob."
