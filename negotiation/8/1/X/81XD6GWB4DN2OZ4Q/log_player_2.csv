# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire this unique product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to part with it for $950000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is well over $1000000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is tempting, but it's still above your desired price point.  You have room to negotiate and try to get a better deal. It's worth seeing if you can get Alice to come down further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product for $875000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value I mentioned earlier. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to your desired price point, but there's still room for negotiation.  You can likely get her to come down a bit more, especially since she's already made a concession.  You're not desperate to buy the product, and you have a backup option with John."

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $862,500 is a good compromise. It's significantly lower than her original price and closer to your target. While you could continue negotiating, it's likely that the price won't drop much further. It's better to accept this offer and avoid the risk of further negotiations breaking down. You're still getting a good deal, and you'll avoid having to buy from John at a much higher price."
