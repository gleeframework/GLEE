"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and meet at $850,000?  I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for you, and this price reflects its true potential. ",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While the product has potential, $850,000 is still a bit high for me. How about $750,000? That's a fair offer.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 still isn't quite where I need to be. Let's try $800,000. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth every penny.  What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,5,
