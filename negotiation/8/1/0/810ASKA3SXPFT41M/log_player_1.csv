Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a higher price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is still a bit below my desired value. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects the value of this product to you.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product, which is my maximum budget. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is right at my minimum acceptable price. There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the next round, and I risk losing the deal altogether.  I'll accept his offer and sell the product for $1,500,000."
