,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate it, but $120 is a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about $105?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $115? It's a fair price that still benefits both of us.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $115 is still a little high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  That way we both get a good deal.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to make another concession. How about $112? It's the lowest I can go and still make it worth my while.",112.0,Alice,5,
