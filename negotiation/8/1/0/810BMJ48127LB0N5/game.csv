"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $110 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $105. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $105 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $102.50. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",102.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $102.50 is closer to what I'm aiming for, I'm still hoping we can reach $95.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize the deal.",95.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that $95 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $98.
