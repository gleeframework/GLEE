"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its value to you and allows me to secure a very good price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly better than buying from John, but there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000. It's a fair price considering the value to me and allows you a healthy profit.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? That gives you a good price and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement on this number. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now a good deal:**  $925,000 is significantly lower than buying from John for $1,200,000.
* **Further negotiation might not be worthwhile:** While Bob could try to push for a lower price, there's no guarantee Alice will budge further. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If Bob keeps rejecting offers, Alice might get frustrated and walk away, forcing him to buy from John at a much higher price."
