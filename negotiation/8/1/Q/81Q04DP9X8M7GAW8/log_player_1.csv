"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to offer $150 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, I have a guaranteed offer from John for $150, which matches Bob's offer.  There's no point in further negotiation with Bob, as I risk him lowering his offer or reaching an impasse. Selling to John ensures I get my minimum acceptable price."
