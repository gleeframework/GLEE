"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm going to try to get a little bit more than $9,000.  I know it's worth $15,000 to Bob, so I think there's room for negotiation."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9,800? I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $9,800. This is a good deal for me, as it's above my minimum of $8,000 and we're getting closer to the middle ground.  It's also possible Bob won't go any higher, and I risk losing the deal altogether."
