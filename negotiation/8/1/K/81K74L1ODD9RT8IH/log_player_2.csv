"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you this great product for $120 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is selling for $120, while John is selling for $150.
* **You're still saving money:** Even at $120, you're getting the product for less than your maximum budget of $150."
