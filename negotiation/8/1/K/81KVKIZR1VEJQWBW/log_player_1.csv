{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you! I'm offering it for $150.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $120 is my minimum, I'm not willing to accept it immediately.  Bob's offer demonstrates he's interested, but I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $135. This still gives me some room, but also gives you a chance to get a great product at a fair price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is inching closer to my desired price, but I'm still hesitant to accept $125. I believe I can squeeze out a bit more. There are still several rounds left, so I'm not in a rush to settle. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to $130."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $125! I'm just a little bit away from my ideal price.  Would you consider $128?  It's a small step for you, and we can finalize this deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 128}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe $125 is still a fair price for the product. I hope you can meet me halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd still prefer to get closer to $130, it's getting late in the game. Bob has been steadfast at $125, and if I reject this offer, I risk going back to my minimum of $120. 

Given that I have the option to sell to John for $120, accepting Bob's offer of $125 is a better outcome for me. It's a reasonable compromise, and I avoid the risk of ending up with nothing."
