"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob.  Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  Buying from John for $800,000 is still the best option, but there's a chance Bob can get a better deal with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the gap between $950,000 and my valuation is substantial.  Could you meet me halfway at $1,025,000? I'm confident this price reflects the true value of the product.

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her previous one, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate further.  Buying from John for $800,000 is still the best option, but there's still room for Bob to try and get a better price from Alice."
