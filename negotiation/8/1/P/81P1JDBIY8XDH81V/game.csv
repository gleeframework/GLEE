"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $9,000? I think that's a fair price.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the product at this price.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $10,500 is still a little steep for me.  How about we settle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,750. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $10,250. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",10250.0,Alice,5,
