"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,000 is better than $10,000, it's still more than the product is worth to Alice ($8,000). There's room for negotiation, so Bob should reject the offer and try to get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer! I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $9,200. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much as possible. While $9,200 is less than the $10,000 he would pay John, it's still more than the product is worth to Alice ($8,000). Bob should continue to negotiate to see if he can get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $8,750 is a good price for you, but I'm still not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you at $9,100. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,100.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to Bob's target:** $9,100 is only $400 more than Bob's last counteroffer of $8,750. 
* **Negotiation is likely to continue:**  If Bob rejects again, there's a good chance Alice will stand firm at $9,100, forcing Bob to either buy from John or accept. 
* **Buying from John is more expensive:**  It's better to accept Alice's offer and save $900 compared to buying from John.

While Bob could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will not budge further and he'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer is the most prudent decision at this point."
