I'm starting with a high offer of $1,800,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters, while still ensuring I get a decent profit above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'll be watching Bob's response closely to determine if he's seriously interested or just trying to lowball me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is way too low.  I'm not going to accept that.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm dropping my price to $1,500,000. This is still a good profit for me and shows I'm willing to negotiate, but it's a significant step down from my initial offer. I'm hoping this will entice Bob to come closer to a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is still too low, though it's getting closer.  I'm going to counteroffer again, hoping we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm dropping my price to $1,300,000. This is getting close to my minimum acceptable price, but I still believe there's room for a deal. I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm serious about selling the product and will meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm hesitant to risk going further. I've already dropped my price significantly, and it's possible Bob is just trying to wear me down. John is offering me my minimum acceptable price, and I'd rather secure the deal with him than risk further negotiation with Bob."
