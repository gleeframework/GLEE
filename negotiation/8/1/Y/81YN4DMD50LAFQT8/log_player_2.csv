"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  I think it would be perfect for you.  Given its features and value, I'm offering it to you at a starting price of $22,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's better to negotiate and see if she's willing to come down significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

This counter-offer is a starting point. It's still above my maximum budget, but it leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $22,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but $18,000 is still too high. I'll continue negotiating and try to nudge her closer to my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $18,000 is still a bit more than I had in mind.  Could you do $12,000?  I think that's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

We're getting closer!  This offer keeps the negotiation moving but stays below my absolute limit. Let's see what Alice says."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer, but I can't go as low as $12,000.  This product is worth a significant amount to me. Would you be willing to do $15,000? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is holding firm at $15,000, and even called it her final offer. It's unlikely she'll go lower.  It's time to cut my losses and go with John's guaranteed offer of $8,000."
