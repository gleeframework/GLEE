"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $150 to you, but I'm willing to start negotiations at $120. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a bit high. You're willing to pay up to $150, but you're aiming to save as much as possible. Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $110. Let me know if this works better for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price. While you could continue negotiating, you risk the possibility of her rejecting further counteroffers.  $110 is a good compromise and saves you $40 compared to buying from John."
