(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's much better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price.  There's still a lot of room for negotiation, and you have 9 more rounds to try."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget,  $800,000. This is a bold move, but it sets the stage for negotiation and makes it clear that I am serious about getting a good deal.  If Alice rejects this offer, we can continue to negotiate downwards."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than my budget. While it's a reduction from the previous round, I believe there's still room for further negotiation. I'm not willing to spend that much, especially since I have several rounds left. I will continue to try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to come down in price, but it's still too high. I'm going to counter with $1,000,000. This is a reasonable compromise that hopefully shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating, while still leaving some room for future negotiations.  We're getting closer to a deal!"

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to slightly raise my counteroffer to $1,250,000.  Alice is clearly willing to negotiate further, and this shows a willingness to meet her halfway.   With only a few rounds left, we need to make progress. This is a reasonable compromise that hopefully will lead to a successful deal!"

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We are down to our last round of negotiation.  While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my target.  I've pushed as hard as I can in these negotiations, and I'm not confident we can reach a deal in this final round.  It's time to cut my losses and buy from John.  Although I would prefer a lower price, John's offer is still within my budget and guarantees I will get the product."
