"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $13,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $13,500 is closer, but still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle at $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $12,000, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $13,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
