"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but not too far off from my minimum ($1,000,000). This gives room for negotiation while still keeping a decent margin.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and optimistic message encourages Bob to engage and potentially compromise. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The offer leaves room for Bob to counter without feeling like he's being taken advantage of.

**Note:**  This is just the first offer.  I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is closer to my minimum but still below my target.  I'm not ready to sell for that price yet. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation, as I'm confident the product is worth more than $900,000 to Bob.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Selling to John now would be a safe option, but I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob.  Rejecting his offer keeps the pressure on him to compromise.

**Next Round:** I'll counter with an offer slightly lower than my initial price, but still above Bob's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by lowering my price but not by much.  This shows good faith and encourages Bob to reciprocate.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer is exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's current offer.  It creates a sense of fairness and makes it easier for Bob to agree.
* **Urgency:**  The message subtly emphasizes the value of the product and pushes for a quick deal. 

**Note:** I'm still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. I'm hoping this encourages him to accept and avoid further rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below My Minimum:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  
* **Further Negotiation:**  While we are getting closer, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'm confident I can push for a higher price, especially since Bob has demonstrated a willingness to increase his offer.
* **Keeping Options Open:** Selling to John now would secure a decent profit, but I'm not ready to give up on the possibility of getting a better price from Bob.

**Next Round:** I'll counter with an offer slightly lower than my previous one, but still above Bob's current offer.  I'll aim to find a price point that balances my desire to maximize profits with the risk of losing the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  While $975,000 is closer, it's still just a little off the mark for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000.  That's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that reflects the true value of the product.  Let's work together to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise & Persistence:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to meet Bob halfway, but I'm still firm in my belief that the product is worth more than his current offer. This shows I'm serious about the deal, but not desperate.
* **Narrowing the Gap:**  My counteroffer is closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. This creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to accept.
* **Positive & Collaborative Tone:** The message emphasizes a collaborative approach, hoping to encourage Bob to find a solution that benefits both parties.

**Note:** This offer is a significant step closer to Bob's offer, and I'm hopeful he'll accept.  If he rejects again, I'll carefully consider my options, as I'm getting close to my limit and the risk of selling to John becomes more attractive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $995,000, but that's my final offer. Can you consider this revised price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $995,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $995,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $995,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  While it would be nice to get a bit more, the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially losing the deal is high.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  If I reject Bob's offer, there's a strong possibility that he will walk away, leaving me with no deal. I've already had five rounds of negotiation, and there are only five rounds left. The odds are against me getting a better offer from Bob.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me a $1,000,000 profit, which is close to my minimum acceptable price. This is a safe and sensible option, given the circumstances. 

**Conclusion:**  With only five rounds left and the risk of a deal falling through, I've decided to secure a guaranteed profit by selling to John. While I would have preferred to get a bit more from Bob, I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."
