"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it incredibly valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but lower than my minimum ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a decent profit.
* **Positive message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Setting a strong baseline:**  By offering a high price in the first round, I establish a strong baseline for further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm interested in your product, but I can only go up to $850,000. This is the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $850,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Room for negotiation:** I have 10 rounds, and I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob.
* **Seeking a higher value:** I am confident that I can achieve a higher price than Bob's current offer.

**Next steps:**  I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal. Let's try to find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:**  I'm lowering my price, demonstrating flexibility, but staying above my minimum threshold.
* **Focusing on value:**  I reiterate the value of the product to justify my price and encourage Bob to see the benefits of investing in it.
* **Seeking compromise:**  I emphasize a ""middle ground"" to show a willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,050,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** Bob's offer is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** We are still in the early rounds of negotiation, and there's potential for Bob to increase his offer.
* **Seeking a better deal:** I'm not yet willing to settle for such a low price, and I believe I can secure a more profitable deal.

**Next steps:** I will counteroffer Bob again, aiming to move the price closer to my desired range."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but we need to find a price that reflects the true value of the product. I'm willing to come down a bit further, to $950,000. This price is fair, considering the benefits you'll gain from this product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price again, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Appealing to Bob's self-interest:** I emphasize the benefits and value Bob will receive, reminding him of the product's worth.
* **Creating urgency:**  By using phrases like ""make this happen,"" I add a touch of urgency to encourage Bob to accept the offer. 

**Next steps:**  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary.  I'm still confident I can reach a mutually beneficial agreement within the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you continuing to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still above my limit.  I'm sticking with my offer of $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation is getting tense:**  We've reached a point where there's a significant gap between our desired prices, and the negotiation is becoming more difficult.
* **Seeking a better outcome:** I'm not ready to give up yet, as I'm confident I can secure a higher price with a few more rounds of negotiation.

**Next steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a slightly lower price in the next round, but I'll emphasize the value of the product and try to push for a deal closer to my minimum. I'm also prepared to explore selling to John if necessary."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but we need to find a middle ground that values the product and benefits us both. I'm willing to go down to $900,000, but that's my final offer. It's a fair price considering the value of the product and the benefits you'll receive. Let's make this deal work!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** I'm stating this as my final offer to signal that I'm nearing my limit and to encourage Bob to take the deal.

* **Urgency and value:** I reiterate the value of the product and emphasize the importance of closing the deal to create a sense of urgency. 
* **Considering John:** With only 3 rounds left, I'm getting closer to John's offer, but I still want to maximize my profit if possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still above my budget. I'm sticking with my offer of $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing in on John's offer:**  With only two rounds left, I'm getting very close to John's offer of $1,000,000.
* **Unlikely to reach agreement with Bob:** Bob has been consistently sticking to his $850,000 offer, indicating a significant gap between our desired prices.
* **Minimizing risk:**  At this point, it's more likely that I can secure a better price with John, minimizing the risk of further negotiation with Bob.

**Next steps:**  I'm choosing to sell to John, securing a guaranteed $1,000,000 for the product.  This is the most sensible option given the current circumstances and the limited time remaining in the negotiation."
