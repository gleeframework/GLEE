# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present you with an opportunity to acquire our premium product, which holds significant value to both parties. Given its worth to you, we propose a transaction price of $900,000. This offer reflects a strategic balance between maximizing our return on investment and ensuring that you receive a valuable asset at a competitive rate. We believe this price will facilitate a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a fantastic deal! Alice is offering the product for significantly less than your maximum price and well below its value to her. Accepting immediately secures a great price and avoids the risk of losing the deal in further negotiation."
