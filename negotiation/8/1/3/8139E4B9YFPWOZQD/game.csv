"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $200 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but my budget is only $80.  Would you be willing to come down to that?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $200 is my initial asking price, I could come down to $160 for you.  That's significantly lower and reflects the value this product offers. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $160 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go over $100.  If you're willing to come down to that price, I'd be happy to buy it.",100.0,Bob,4,
