"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you coming down from your original price, but $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of counteroffering at $11,500. This is a compromise that I believe still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $10,000.  This is a fair price considering your value of the product is significantly lower. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $10,000, considering its value to me is $8,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $11,000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",11000.0,Alice,5,
