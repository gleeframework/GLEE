Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close!  I'm willing to go down to $12,250. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get what we want.  Let's make this deal happen.

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but she's unlikely to go much lower than $12,250. Accepting this offer gets you a good price and avoids the risk of her raising the price in later rounds."
