"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts!",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  However, $11,000 is just too low for me. How about $13,000?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still find this a great deal.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. $13,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a lower price. Would you be open to $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $11,500 is still below what I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to go down to $12,500. That's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $12,500 is getting closer, but I'm aiming to stay under $12,000. Would you consider $11,750?",11750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close!  I'm willing to go down to $12,250. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get what we want.  Let's make this deal happen.",12250.0,Alice,7,
