Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.  He won't pay more than this.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's no overlap between your minimum and Bob's maximum. Any deal depends on negotiation tactics and information asymmetry.

**Strategy**

Since there's no ZOPA based on the current information, you have two main options:

1. **High Anchor with Room for Negotiation:** Start with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping he'll counter-offer within a range acceptable to you (above $1,500,000).

2. **Direct Sale to John:** Recognize that a deal with Bob is unlikely and sell directly to John for the guaranteed amount.

**The Offer (Option 1 - Attempting Negotiation)**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm valuing it at $1,800,000. I'm open to discussing this further if you have any thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Anchor:** $1,800,000 sets a high starting point.
* **Open to Discussion:**  The message implies willingness to negotiate, potentially leading Bob to counter-offer.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Negotiation Skills:** If Bob is a skilled negotiator, he might recognize the lack of ZOPA and walk away.
* **Your Risk Tolerance:**  Are you willing to risk losing the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John on the chance of getting a higher price from Bob?

**Option 2 (Direct Sale to John) is the safer choice if you want to guarantee the $1,500,000.**"
