"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this truly unique product. Its value is undeniable, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. To make this a swift deal, I propose a price of $1,800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your maximum valuation and John's offer. It makes no sense to accept this offer. It's highly likely you can negotiate a much better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $1,800,000 is far beyond what I'm willing to spend. I could consider a price closer to $500,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 500000}

**Reasoning:** Starting with a low counter-offer significantly below your actual limit gives you more room for negotiation. It also signals to Alice that her initial offer was drastically overpriced from your perspective."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $500,000 is too low, I'm open to finding a middle ground. How about we meet halfway at $1,150,000? This recognizes the true value of the product while offering you a significant discount. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer has come down considerably, it's still above your fallback option of buying from John.  There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a reasonable price. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to go up to $700,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 700000}

**Reasoning:**  We're steadily increasing our offer, showing Alice we're willing to negotiate.  This offer is still significantly below both her asking price and John's price, giving us room to maneuver."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems we're getting closer.  I understand your constraints, but I need to ensure the price reflects the product's worth.  Let's settle this at $925,000.  It's a fair offer considering the value you'll be receiving. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** We're now in a delicate stage of negotiation. While Alice's offer is getting closer to John's price, it's still above your ideal budget.  There's a chance she might be willing to go lower, especially since we're nearing the halfway point of the rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, you're right, we're getting close!  I'm ready to make a serious offer: $800,000.  I believe that's a very fair price that recognizes the value while working within my budget."", ""product_price"": 800000}

**Reasoning:** We're making a significant jump in our offer, signaling to Alice that we're serious about closing the deal. This price point is a strong offer, providing a good balance between potential savings and the risk of Alice walking away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your commitment to this deal. Let's split the difference and close this out.  How about $862,500?  This ensures a win-win for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $862,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $862,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**  Alice is clearly trying to anchor the negotiation around the midpoint. While $862,500 is a reasonable price, we're still in a position to push for a slightly better deal. We have three rounds left, and Alice is likely feeling the pressure to close."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, you're a tough negotiator! I respect that.  Tell you what, let's make this our final exchange to save us both time.  I'll offer you $825,000.  It's a strong offer, and I'm hoping you'll see it as a chance to close the deal today."", ""product_price"": 825000}

**Reasoning:**  We're now entering the final stages of negotiation. Offering a final price demonstrates seriousness and creates a sense of urgency. $825,000 represents a final compromise, saving you a significant amount compared to John's offer and likely being acceptable to Alice given the dwindling rounds."
