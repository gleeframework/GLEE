"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this truly unique product. Its value is undeniable, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. To make this a swift deal, I propose a price of $1,800,000. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $1,800,000 is far beyond what I'm willing to spend. I could consider a price closer to $500,000.  What do you think?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $500,000 is too low, I'm open to finding a middle ground. How about we meet halfway at $1,150,000? This recognizes the true value of the product while offering you a significant discount.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a reasonable price. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to go up to $700,000.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,4,
