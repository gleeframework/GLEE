"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000, reflecting the value I see in the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? I believe this reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's compromise at $1,325,000. This reflects a fair price for both of us, allowing me to purchase the product while giving you a good return on your investment."", ""product_price"": 1325000}
