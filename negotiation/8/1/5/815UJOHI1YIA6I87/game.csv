"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000, reflecting the value I see in the product.  Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? I believe this reflects the true value of the product.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's compromise at $1,325,000. This reflects a fair price for both of us, allowing me to purchase the product while giving you a good return on your investment.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
