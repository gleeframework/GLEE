Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$11,500** is a reasonable price that maximizes my potential profit while still being attractive to Bob.  
* It's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, allowing me to earn more than I would by selling to John.
* It's also lower than Bob's valuation of $12,000, making it a good deal for him and increasing the chances of him accepting."
