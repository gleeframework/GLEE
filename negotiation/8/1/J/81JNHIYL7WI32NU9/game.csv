"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you bringing this to my attention. However, $18000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for this product, as I'm sure it's a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $12000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price between $12000 and $18000. How about $15000? It's a good middle ground that I think we can both agree on. Let me know what you think!",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $15000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference. I'm happy to offer $13500 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects both our interests.  Let me know what you think.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to split the difference, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $15000 and $13500. How about $14250? It's a fair compromise that I think we can both agree on. Let me know what you think!",14250.0,Alice,5,
