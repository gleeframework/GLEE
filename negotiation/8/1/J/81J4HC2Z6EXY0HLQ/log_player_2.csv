"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is less than what John is offering, it's still significantly higher than Alice's own valuation of the product ($800,000). This suggests there's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, Bob might be able to get Alice to lower her price further."
