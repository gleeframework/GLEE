"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I can do $125, which is still a great discount from the original price, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, I'm not willing to meet you at $100. I can do $110, which is still a great compromise, but it's the lowest I can go. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,5,
