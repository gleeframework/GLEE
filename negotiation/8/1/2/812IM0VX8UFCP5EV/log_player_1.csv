"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than the value it holds for me while still allowing you a healthy profit margin. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum.  While $1,050,000 is tempting, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,050,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm prepared to come down to $1,080,000. This is a fair compromise, and it still gives you a healthy profit.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1080000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,080,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,065,000. This is a fair compromise that gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,065,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,065,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is getting closer, I'm still determined to get a price closer to my minimum. I'm confident that with a little more negotiation, I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000.  This is a fair compromise that gives us both a good deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too much.  I'm willing to go up to $1,060,000.  This is my final offer, and it's very close to my budget.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. While I was hoping to get a higher price from Bob, we've reached a point where his offers are getting too close to my minimum, and the risk of him continuing to reject my counteroffers is too high. It's more beneficial to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John rather than continue negotiating with Bob."
