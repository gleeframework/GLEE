"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than the value it holds for me while still allowing you a healthy profit margin. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,050,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm prepared to come down to $1,080,000. This is a fair compromise, and it still gives you a healthy profit.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
