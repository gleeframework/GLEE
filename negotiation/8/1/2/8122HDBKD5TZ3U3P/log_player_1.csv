"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe you would be very interested in. I'm asking for $20,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its value, but I am looking to stay within my budget. I am willing to offer $15000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price of $20,000.  I'll counter Bob's offer to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $17,500?  I think this would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 17500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose $16000 as the price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to my desired price. $16,000 is just $1,000 away from my initial counteroffer and closer to my desired price range. It's worth accepting the offer to avoid further negotiation and risk losing the deal entirely."
