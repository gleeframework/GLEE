"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer.  $120 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $85?  I'm really interested in the product, but that's my top limit.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $85 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $100?  That would still give me a little room to make this worthwhile, and hopefully it's a price you're happy with.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $100 is still a little high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $90.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground here.",90.0,Bob,4,
