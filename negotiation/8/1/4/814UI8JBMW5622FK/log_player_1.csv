Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really enjoy.  I'm offering it to you for $120.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:** Keeping the message friendly and positive can help maintain a good relationship and encourage Bob to negotiate.
* **Not too aggressive:** This price allows for some room to lower if necessary, but still gives me a good chance of making a profit. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's response:**  If he rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.
* **Be prepared to negotiate:**  If Bob counteroffers, I'll be ready to make counteroffers of my own, aiming to reach a price closer to my minimum acceptable value.
* **Consider John's offer:**  If the negotiation with Bob drags on or stalls, I can always choose to sell to John for the guaranteed $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, thanks for the offer.  $120 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $85?  I'm really interested in the product, but that's my top limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $85 is less than my minimum acceptable value of $150.
* **Negotiation room:**  There's still room to negotiate with Bob, as he's expressed interest in the product. 
* **Selling to John is the safest option:** While I could accept Bob's offer,  selling to John would guarantee me a higher profit and less risk. However, I want to see if I can get a better deal from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer Bob:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum value.
* **Monitor the negotiation:** I'll carefully consider each counteroffer from Bob and be prepared to adjust my own offers as needed.
* **Keep John's offer in mind:** If the negotiation with Bob drags on or becomes unproductive, I can always opt to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $85 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $100?  That would still give me a little room to make this worthwhile, and hopefully it's a price you're happy with."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  This offer is closer to Bob's offer, but it's still significantly above my minimum. It shows willingness to negotiate while also maintaining a comfortable profit margin.
* **Friendly tone:**  Maintaining a positive and friendly tone can help keep the negotiation amicable and encourage Bob to continue.
* **Reasoning provided:**  Explaining the logic behind the offer (""give me a little room"") can make it seem more reasonable to Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's response:** I'll carefully consider Bob's reaction to this counteroffer.
* **Be prepared to adjust:** If Bob rejects again, I'll need to decide whether to make another counteroffer or move on to John's offer.
* **Remember John's offer:** If the negotiation with Bob stalls, I have a guaranteed $150 waiting from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $100 is still a little high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $90.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $90 is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable value of $150. 
* **High probability of deal:** Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate and has raised his offer. It's likely we can reach an agreement quickly.
* **Risk of losing John:**  If I keep rejecting offers and pushing for a higher price, I risk losing John as a buyer. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Finalizing the deal:**  I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale. 
* **Future negotiations:** I'll learn from this experience and consider how to approach future negotiations with potential buyers."
