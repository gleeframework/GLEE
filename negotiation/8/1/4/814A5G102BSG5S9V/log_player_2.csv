```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** $900,000 is over your budget of $800,000.

* **John is a backup option:** You have a guaranteed alternative if negotiations with Alice fail."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  A $750,000 offer is a significant discount from Alice's initial price but still leaves room for her to profit.
* **Testing the waters:**  This counteroffer gauges Alice's willingness to negotiate. If she rejects, you can adjust your subsequent offers. 
* **Staying within budget:** This price is comfortably within your $800,000 limit."
