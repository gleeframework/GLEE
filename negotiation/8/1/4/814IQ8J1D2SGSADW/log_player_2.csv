"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,200,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above my budget of $800,000.  There's no point in accepting this offer. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,200,000 is significantly outside my budget. Given my research, I'm confident that $800,000 is a fair price for this product. I'm ready to close the deal at that amount."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 undervalues the product significantly. I've done extensive research and analysis, and I'm confident it's worth considerably more.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $1,900,000 is still well above my budget. I'm going to continue negotiating with Alice, but I'm also keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me. Given my research and the market value of similar products, I'm confident that $1,000,000 is a fair and reasonable price.  Let's find a middle ground here. "", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up in price. It shows you're serious. To be frank, $1,000,000 is still quite a bit below what I can accept. However, I'm very motivated to close a deal with you today. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,600,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming closer to my price, $1,600,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm also keeping John's offer in mind as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.  Let's close this deal today!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're getting closer! I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be completely transparent, I have a hard limit, and I can't let this go for less than $1,450,000.  This is my final offer - how about we seal the deal right now? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down significantly, $1,450,000 is still outside my budget. At this point, it's clear that we're not going to be able to agree on a price that works for both of us. It's time to take John's offer and buy the product for $800,000. It's a much better deal for me, and I don't want to risk wasting more time negotiating with Alice."
