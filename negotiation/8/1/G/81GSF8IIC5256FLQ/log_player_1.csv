Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the market demand.

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to our minimum, we still have room to negotiate and aim for a higher price. We're willing to go a few more rounds to see if we can bridge the gap."

Round 5

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $915,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value and potential benefits it offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob's offer increments are getting smaller, and he doesn't seem willing to meet near our desired price point.  At this stage, the potential profit from continuing to haggle with Bob is outweighed by the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. It's time to cut our losses and secure the guaranteed profit."
