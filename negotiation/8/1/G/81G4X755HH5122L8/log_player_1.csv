Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I know would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing the Value:** You know Bob values the product at $1,200,000 and you have a guaranteed offer for $800,000. This gives you a strong negotiating position.
* **Aiming High:** Starting with an offer of $1,100,000 allows room for negotiation downward while still securing a significant profit above your minimum. 
* **Leaving Room for Bob:** Offering a price that still nets Bob a $100,000 gain compared to his perceived value makes it more likely he'll find the deal attractive. 

**Strategy:**

This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring Bob accepts the offer. If Bob counter-offers, you have the flexibility to negotiate down towards $900,000 while still exceeding your minimum selling price."
