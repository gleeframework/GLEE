Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $20,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $20,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product but my budget is capped at $15,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm confident in the value this product brings. How about we meet halfway at $17,500? It's a fair price considering its worth."", ""product_price"": 17500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my budget of $15,000. If you're unable to meet that price, I'll unfortunately have to look elsewhere. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is firm on his $15,000 offer, and further negotiation is unlikely to result in a better outcome. Accepting John's offer ensures I get the product's value without risking a stalemate with Bob."
