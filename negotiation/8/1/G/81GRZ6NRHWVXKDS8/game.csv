"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll really enjoy. I'm asking for $110 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $110 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  How about $85?  I'm really interested in this product, but I have a budget I need to stick to.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you showing interest.  While $85 is below my ideal price, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $95?  This would allow me to make a fair profit while still considering your budget.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit.  How about $90?  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm happy to keep negotiating.  I'm going to counter with $92.50.  This is a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price.",92.5,Alice,5,
