"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll really enjoy. I'm asking for $110 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $110, knowing it's above Bob's value but still within a reasonable range. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Positive framing:** I'm highlighting the product's benefits and emphasizing a ""fair price"" to make the offer more appealing.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm clearly stating that I'm open to discussing the price, signaling flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $110 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  How about $85?  I'm really interested in this product, but I have a budget I need to stick to. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $85 is less than my minimum acceptable price of $100.  
* **Negotiation potential:** While Bob is being firm, there is still room for negotiation. A counteroffer will allow me to gauge his willingness to compromise.
* **John's offer is a backup:**  I have a guaranteed $100 offer from John, so I'm not desperate to take Bob's offer.  This gives me leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you showing interest.  While $85 is below my ideal price, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $95?  This would allow me to make a fair profit while still considering your budget."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from $110 to $95, demonstrating a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Emphasize fairness:** I'm framing the $95 offer as a ""fair profit"" for me while still acknowledging Bob's budget. 
* **Maintain leverage:** $95 is still higher than Bob's offer and closer to my minimum.  This keeps me in a strong negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit.  How about $90?  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **John's offer is secure:** I can still sell to John for $100, so there's no urgency to settle for less.
* **Negotiation potential:** Bob is showing increasing willingness to compromise, so a counteroffer may be more successful."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm happy to keep negotiating.  I'm going to counter with $92.50.  This is a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small but strategic move:** I'm only moving up slightly from Bob's offer, showing a willingness to meet him halfway.
* **Re-emphasize compromise:** I'm reiterating that this is a ""good compromise"" to highlight the win-win situation.
* **Maintain pressure:**  $92.50 is still slightly above Bob's offer, but closer to my minimum acceptable price. This keeps me in a stronger negotiating position."
