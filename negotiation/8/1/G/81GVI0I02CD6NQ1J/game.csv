"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product, which I believe will be highly valuable to your business.  While I'm confident it's worth more than $800,000 to me, I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that reflects its potential value to you.  How about $1,000,000?  This price allows for a significant return on investment for you, while still ensuring I get a fair price for my asset.  Let me know your thoughts!",1000000.0,Alice,1,
