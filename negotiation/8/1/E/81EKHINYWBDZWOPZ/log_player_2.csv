"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $800,000. This is a great opportunity to get an amazing deal, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great.**  While $800,000 is a significant discount from your maximum, there's still room for improvement.
* **You have 10 rounds.** This gives you the time to try and negotiate a better price.
* **Buying from John is a backup plan.** It's important to keep this option in mind, but it's not the best value at this point. 

**Next Steps:**

You should counteroffer with a price that is closer to your target but still leaves room for negotiation. For example, a counteroffer of $700,000 would be a good starting point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $800,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $700,000 right now.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $750,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get an amazing deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is moving in the right direction.**  Her offer of $750,000 is closer to your target price. 
* **You still have room for improvement.**  There's still a gap between your desired price and Alice's offer.
* **Buying from John is a backup plan.** It's still a good option, but you're closer to your goal with Alice.

**Next Steps:**

You should make another counteroffer.  Since Alice is already willing to meet you halfway, try a counteroffer of $725,000. This demonstrates your willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for a potential compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I'm still not quite there at $750,000.  I'm prepared to go to $725,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product and allows us to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 725000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm offering $737,500, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I believe this price reflects the product's value and is a fair deal for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $737,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $737,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting closer to your target.** Her offer of $737,500 is only $37,500 more than your last counteroffer.
* **You're nearing your goal.**  This deal would save you $462,500 compared to buying from John.
* **The risk of rejecting is high.** Alice seems willing to negotiate, but rejecting could lead to a stalemate or a higher price in future rounds.

**Conclusion:**

While you could try to negotiate a little lower, the risk of a breakdown is increasing. Accepting this offer is the best strategy to secure the product at a reasonable price."
