"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $5,000 for the product.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $5,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $9,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I could go up to $6,500, but to be honest, I've found a similar product elsewhere for $8,000.  If you can get closer to that price, I'd much prefer to buy from you.",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $6,500. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $8,200. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value and quality.",8200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting close. I can offer you $7,900 for the product. I'm stretching my budget here, so that's really the best I can do. If you're willing to work with me on this, I'm ready to close the deal.",7900.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $7,900. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value and quality.",8500.0,Alice,7,
