Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in this product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's offer is still significantly above your minimum price. Let's negotiate a bit more.
