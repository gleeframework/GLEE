"Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $8000 is a good one, but I'm still looking to get a bit more value for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9000. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll still get a great deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your willingness to compromise,  $9000 is still a bit higher than where I want to be. I'm happy to meet you at $8500. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $8500 is a good one, but I'm still not willing to give up too much value on the product. I'm willing to meet you at $8700, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to accept it.",8700.0,Alice,5,
