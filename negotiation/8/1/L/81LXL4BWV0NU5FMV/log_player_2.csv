"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1100000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,100,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should try to get a lower price from Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial solution."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. However, I'm not quite willing to meet you at $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm going to counter with $1075000. This is a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable, and it's a good starting point for further negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,075,000 is still a good deal for Bob, considering he's willing to pay up to $1,200,000.  It's also a good starting point for further negotiation, as Bob has already shown his willingness to compromise.  Accepting this offer saves Bob a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
