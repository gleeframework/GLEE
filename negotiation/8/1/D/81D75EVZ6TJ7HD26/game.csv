"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,700,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While I'm happy to negotiate, $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,600,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $1,475,000? I feel that's a fair offer.",1475000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,475,000 simply doesn't cover my costs. To make this work for me, I'd need to settle for a price of $1,550,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know what you think.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
