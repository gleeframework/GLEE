``` 

I'm starting high, at $1,700,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but gives me room to negotiate. It also signals that I'm confident in the product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to accept it.  I will counteroffer in the next round."

I'm lowering my price to $1,550,000. This is still above Bob's initial offer, but it demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to compromise. It's also closer to my minimum acceptable price, making it a more attractive option for Bob."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still too low.  I'm not willing to drop below my minimum, even though I could get $1,500,000 from John. I'll see if I can get Bob to budge a bit further."

I'm lowering the price to $1,450,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price and leaves some room for further negotiation."
