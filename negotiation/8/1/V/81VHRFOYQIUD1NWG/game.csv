"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As the owner, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth $1,500,000 to you. I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,400,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,250,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,250,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Could we settle at $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,175,000 is still a bit above your comfort zone. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,200,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
