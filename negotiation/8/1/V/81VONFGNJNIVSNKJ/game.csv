"Hi Bob, I understand you've reached your budget limit, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not at my minimum price. I'm willing to make one last concession. I'm counteroffering $9,200, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options, including selling to another buyer.",9200.0,Alice,9,
