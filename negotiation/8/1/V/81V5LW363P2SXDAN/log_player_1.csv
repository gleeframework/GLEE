"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to let it go for $18,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $18,000 is way out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product but I can only afford to pay $8,000. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum, and while there's room for negotiation, taking a $4,000 loss in round 2 is too much.  I'll try to steer him closer to a reasonable price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is significantly below the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $15,000 to find a solution that works for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but $15,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob is showing movement, but I'm still losing out on a potential $2,000. I'll try one more time to get closer to my minimum.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Let's find a middle ground: I can do $13,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $13,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000. If you're serious about selling this product, we need to meet somewhere in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","This is a tough one. Bob is getting closer, but I'm hesitant to lose out on an extra $1,000. However, there's no guarantee Bob will go any higher, and I risk losing the sale altogether. 

```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While it would be ideal to get a higher price from Bob, accepting the guaranteed $12,000 from John is the safest option at this point."
