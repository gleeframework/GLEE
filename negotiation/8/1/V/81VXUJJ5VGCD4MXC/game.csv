"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  However, I want to make this happen.  I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time, at $10,250. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",10250.0,Alice,5,
