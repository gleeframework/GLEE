"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $10000. Considering its high quality and unique features, I would like to propose a price of $9500 for it. I believe this offer presents a great opportunity for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get a better price by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the first offer allows for more negotiation rounds to potentially achieve a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value of this product, but $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of our product, I am willing to accept a price of $9000 for it. This offer includes all the features and benefits you're looking for, and I believe it provides a fair compromise for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,000, which is a good price for Bob.  While he could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will become less flexible or that Bob will run out of rounds before reaching a better price. Accepting the offer at this point secures the product at a price lower than John's offer, achieving Bob's goal of saving money."
