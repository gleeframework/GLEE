"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $20000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product. Let me know if you're open to that.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $8000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $12000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we split the difference and go with $10000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10000, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll counteroffer at $11500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",11500.0,Alice,5,
