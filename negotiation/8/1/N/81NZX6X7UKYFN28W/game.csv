"Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, reflecting its value and a fair price for both of us. This offer is within my budget and should be attractive for you as it's significantly higher than your own valuation.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. After considering your proposal, I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I would like to counter with an offer of $900,000 for the product. This price reflects its value while remaining competitive within your budget. I look forward to your response.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $875,000, which is a fair compromise and closer to my budget.  This would still be a profitable deal for you, and I'm confident we can close this deal if you accept.",875000.0,Bob,4,
