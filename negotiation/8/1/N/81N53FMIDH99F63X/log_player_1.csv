Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're still making a profit above your $1,000,000 minimum.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** You're leaving room for negotiation, encouraging Bob to accept or counteroffer.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing you a decent profit and me a good price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly below your desired profit margin.  Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal.  Here's why:

* **Room for negotiation:**  There's still a gap between Bob's offer and your minimum price.  You can use this gap to potentially reach a more favorable price.
* **Testing Bob's commitment:**  Rejecting his offer shows that you're not desperate to sell and that you believe the product is worth more. This might push Bob to reconsider his position.
* **Avoiding a loss:**  While selling to John guarantees $1,000,000, a counteroffer with Bob has the potential for a better outcome.

By rejecting Bob's offer, you maintain control of the negotiation and can potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This would still give you a great deal, and it's closer to my desired price. Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Staying above your minimum:** $1,100,000 is still above your minimum of $1,000,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **Meeting Bob halfway:** This offer is a compromise between your previous offer and Bob's. It demonstrates your willingness to negotiate and find a solution.
* **Maintaining pressure:** It shows Bob that you're serious about getting a price closer to your desired value.

This counteroffer balances the need for a good profit with the need to keep the negotiation moving forward."
