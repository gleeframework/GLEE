Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $15,000, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested.  I'm hoping to gauge his interest and understand his perceived value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, his offer is significantly less than my minimum value.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}

I'm counteroffering with $17,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's lowball price.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to sell for significantly less than my minimum value.  I'll reject his offer and make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $16,000.  This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, but I'm still holding firm to a price that's reasonable for me.  I believe this is a fair offer, and I hope Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where Bob's offers are becoming increasingly unreasonable. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, his offers are now consistently below my minimum value. To ensure I receive a fair price, I'll sell the product to John for $15,000.  This guarantees me a reasonable profit and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
