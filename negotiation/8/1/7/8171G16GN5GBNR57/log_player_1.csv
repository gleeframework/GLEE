Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives him incentive to negotiate, but not so high that he'll immediately reject it. 
* **It's below your minimum:** This leaves room for you to make concessions if necessary.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** You can always adjust the price based on Bob's response.

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit while still making a sale. You can use this initial offer to gauge Bob's interest and then adjust your strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some more. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to:

* **Negotiate further:** You can make a counteroffer closer to your desired price, potentially reaching a mutually agreeable compromise.
* **Maintain leverage:**  Rejecting the offer shows Bob that you're serious about getting a better price and increases your negotiating power. 
* **Explore selling to John:**  If negotiations with Bob stall, you still have the option to sell to John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,500 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,250? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still find this a valuable purchase."", ""product_price"": 9250}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is closer to your desired price:** This offer is still below your minimum but moves closer to your target.
* **Emphasizes fairness:**  The message highlights the ""splitting the difference"" aspect, making it appear like a compromise and a fair solution. 
* **Maintains positive tone:** Keeping the communication friendly helps keep the negotiation productive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $8,750 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,750 is closer to your desired price than Bob's previous offer, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  

**Here's why it's better to reject and counter-offer:**

* **Negotiating for a better price:**  You can continue to negotiate for a price closer to your target, potentially reaching a mutually agreeable compromise.
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting the offer shows Bob that you're not desperate for a sale and that you're serious about getting a fair price.
* **Balancing risk:** While John is a sure sale at $10,000, there's still potential to get closer to that price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

You can make a counteroffer closer to your desired price. For example, you could offer $9,000 and emphasize that it's a final offer. This strategy helps to incentivize Bob to accept while still ensuring you get a decent price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time. I'll offer you the product for $9,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final offer:** This emphasizes the seriousness of the offer and encourages Bob to accept.
* **Meeting halfway:**  The message highlights that you're willing to compromise to reach a deal.
* **Fair price:**  The message reinforces the idea that the price is reasonable for both parties.

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting closer to your goal:** $9,000 is still below your ideal price, but it's closer to your minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Creating urgency:**  The ""final offer"" approach adds urgency and puts the ball in Bob's court. 
* **Maintaining flexibility:** While you're signaling a final offer, you still have the option to sell to John if Bob rejects this offer."
