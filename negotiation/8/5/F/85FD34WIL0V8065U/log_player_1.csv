"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob ($12,000) but significantly lower than my minimum desired price ($15,000). This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" to make it more appealing to Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm inviting Bob to share his thoughts, signaling that I'm willing to negotiate. 

**Note:** This is a strategic starting point. Depending on Bob's response, I will adjust my strategy in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me ($15,000).
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I can likely get a better price than $12,500. 
* **Risk of Selling to John:** While selling to John for $15,000 is tempting, I want to maximize my profit. I'm not convinced that Bob won't budge further.

**Next Step:** I will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to reach a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500 to make this deal work.  Let's meet in the middle - what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($14,000) and Bob's offer ($12,500). This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining a Profit:** $13,500 is still above my minimum desired price of $15,000. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation friendly. 
* **Open-ended Question:**  I'm asking for Bob's input to make him feel involved in the decision and encourage him to counter if he still wants to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13,500, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $13,000. Let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Deal:** While $13,000 is still lower than my desired price, it's closer to my minimum.  There's a risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially ending up with a worse offer or running out of rounds. 
* **Time is of the Essence:** With only 6 rounds left, it's important to make a decision. Selling to John for $15,000 is tempting, but there's no guarantee that a better deal won't come along in the remaining rounds. 
* **Avoiding Counteroffers:**  Continuing to counteroffer might lead to a prolonged negotiation that could backfire, potentially resulting in a lower price or a deal falling through entirely.

**Conclusion:** Accepting Bob's offer of $13,000 seems like the most reasonable option at this point. It ensures a sale and avoids the risks associated with further negotiation."
