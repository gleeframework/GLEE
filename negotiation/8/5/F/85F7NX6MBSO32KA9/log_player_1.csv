Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you! I'm offering it at $90.  This is a good price, but I'm open to negotiation.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 90}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be happy to pay $75 for it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
 Bob's offer is lower than my minimum price, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to get a better price in the next round. But I'm not willing to sell for less than $80, so I'll reject the offer and see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not able to go that low right now. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $82.50.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 82.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about $80? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate.  It's best to accept his offer and close the deal now."
