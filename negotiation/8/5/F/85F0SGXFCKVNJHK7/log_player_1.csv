Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but below Bob's valuation leaves space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can still potentially settle closer to your desired price.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John will buy the product for $800,000 ensures you won't lose out entirely if Bob declines. This knowledge empowers you to aim higher with Bob.

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or financial limitations beyond his product valuation."
