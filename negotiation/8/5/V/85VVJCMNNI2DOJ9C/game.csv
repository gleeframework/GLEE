"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product but I can only go up to $1000000. This is a fair price considering my budget constraints. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1000000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll make a counteroffer of $1400000. This is still a great deal considering the product's worth, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for coming down, but $1400000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1200000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement here.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1200000. I'm still holding out for a better price. I'll make a new counteroffer of $1300000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1300000 is still a little high for me.  I'm going to make one final offer of $1250000.  This is the absolute most I can do. If it's not acceptable, I'll have to go with another option.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1250000 is your final offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one last counteroffer of $1290000. This is as close as I can get to your offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know what you think.",1290000.0,Alice,7,
