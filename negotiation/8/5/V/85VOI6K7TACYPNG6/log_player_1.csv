Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $80. Would you consider lowering the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I will reject Bob's offer. While $80 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I won't sell the product for less than my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $80 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I will continue to negotiate with Bob, hoping to find a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there. How about $95? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 95}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached my limit with Bob's negotiation tactics. He's unwilling to budge, and I'm not comfortable selling the product for less than $120.  I'll sell the product to John, who is willing to pay my minimum price."
