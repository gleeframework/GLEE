"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I've done some research and I think that's a fair price for this product. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? I'm sure you'll agree that's a fair price for this valuable product.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $8,500. That's the highest I'm willing to pay. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $8,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $9,500 to make this happen. That's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great value for you. What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,5,
