"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget. Given the product's value to you, I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. It seems we have some ground to cover to reach a deal. Considering its intrinsic value and potential, I'm proposing $1,950,000. This represents a significant reduction on my part, demonstrating my willingness to find a compromise.",1950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,950,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. Let's see if we can bridge this gap.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
