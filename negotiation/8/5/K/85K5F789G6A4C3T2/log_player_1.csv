Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm not willing to pay $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $900,000 is too low for me. I'm confident that I can get a better price, especially since I can always sell to John for $1,000,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make a profit. How about $1,100,000? It's still a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'm not desperate and selling to John for $1,000,000 is always an option. I'll counteroffer Bob in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I'm trying to be flexible here, but $950,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,050,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer! I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This is my final offer, as I'm already at the point where selling to John for $1,000,000 becomes a more attractive option.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm concerned we won't be able to close the deal in the remaining rounds.  John is a guaranteed sale, and I don't want to risk losing out on a solid deal."
