"I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm not willing to pay $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make a profit. How about $1,100,000? It's still a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I'm trying to be flexible here, but $950,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,050,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I need to stay within my budget.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're getting closer! I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This is my final offer, as I'm already at the point where selling to John for $1,000,000 becomes a more attractive option.  Let's close this deal.",1025000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand that you're getting close to your limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,025,000. I'm willing to pay $990,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it holds for me.",990000.0,Bob,8,
