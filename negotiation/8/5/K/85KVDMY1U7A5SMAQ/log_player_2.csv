"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than her own valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John allows Bob to get the product at his desired price point."
