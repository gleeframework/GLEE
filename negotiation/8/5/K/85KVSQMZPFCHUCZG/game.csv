"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $20000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $18000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to compromise. However, I'm not comfortable going all the way down to $18000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $20000 and $18000, which would be $19000. What do you think?",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $19000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $18500, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",18500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18500 is a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $19000. I'm willing to make a small concession, though. I'll meet you at $18800. What do you think?",18800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the concession, Alice, but $18800 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $18500, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options",18500.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're willing to meet me at $18500, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'll make one more concession. I'll meet you at $18700. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options",18700.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I've made a serious offer of $18500, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I think that's a fair price for this product, and I'm not willing to pay any more than that. I'd like to reiterate that I'm willing to meet you at $18500",18500.0,Bob,8,
