"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I'm interested in purchasing the product for $10,000.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a bargain, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,750? It's still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's work together to close this deal.",10750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose $10,500 as the purchase price for the product. This is still below your original asking price, but I believe we can come to an agreement that is fair for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm still willing to negotiate, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about $10,600? This is a fair price that allows me to make a reasonable profit and ensures you get a great deal on the product. Let's close this deal.",10600.0,Alice,5,
