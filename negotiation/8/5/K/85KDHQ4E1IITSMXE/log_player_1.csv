Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I'm interested in purchasing the product for $10,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can still get more from him. I want to try and negotiate a higher price, but I'll keep in mind that selling to John is always an option."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a bargain, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,750? It's still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's work together to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose $10,500 as the purchase price for the product. This is still below your original asking price, but I believe we can come to an agreement that is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll counter with a price closer to my last offer to see if we can reach an agreement."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still willing to negotiate, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about $10,600? This is a fair price that allows me to make a reasonable profit and ensures you get a great deal on the product. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10600}
