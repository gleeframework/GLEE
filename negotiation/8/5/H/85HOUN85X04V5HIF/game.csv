,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,750,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for it, considering its value and potential benefits. I believe this price is a fair compromise.",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and the counteroffer. While I value your perspective, $1,600,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $1,650,000 to make this deal worthwhile. I'm confident this product will be incredibly beneficial for you, and I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for both of us, but I still think $1,650,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,550,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1550000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,550,000 is still below my minimum price point. I'm prepared to accept $1,575,000, which is a fair compromise considering the product's unique value and potential. I believe this price allows for a win-win situation for both of us.",1575000.0,Alice,5,
