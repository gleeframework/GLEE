I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a good starting point - it's higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $15,000 if Bob doesn't accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. I can still sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not in a hurry to settle for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counter-offering Bob with $13,500. It's a compromise that's closer to his offer but still ensures I get a better price than he originally offered."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John. Bob's offer is getting closer to my bottom line, but it's still not enough to make me want to keep negotiating. John offers a guaranteed $15,000, which is significantly better than the risk of continuing with Bob."
