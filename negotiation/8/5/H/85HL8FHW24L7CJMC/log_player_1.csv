Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fantastic deal, considering its true value to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer starts high but leaves room for negotiation, as it is still significantly less than what the product is worth to Bob. It also frames the deal as beneficial to Bob, increasing his chances of accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to its true worth to me. I am willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still lower than what I'd like to get. I'm willing to negotiate further to try to get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit below what I'm aiming for.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still feel that the product's true value to me is closer to $875,000. I would like to propose this as our final offer to ensure both parties are satisfied. I hope you consider this proposal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to get closer to $900,000, Bob's final offer of $875,000 is still significantly higher than John's offer of $800,000.  It's a good deal for me, and I'm happy to accept it."
