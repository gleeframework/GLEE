"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth $8,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9500. This is a fair price that considers both our needs. Let's close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has come up slightly, his offer is still significantly below what I'm comfortable accepting. I'm confident that I can either get closer to my asking price in the next round or, if necessary, sell to John.  I'm not in a rush to settle for a low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're both trying to find a middle ground here. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. This price is still a good value for you, and it's closer to the value I place on the product. Let's close this deal and both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $9750. This is a fair compromise that reflects our respective values. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. While Bob has raised his offer, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I don't want to risk losing more time and potentially having to settle for an even lower price. Selling to John guarantees me my desired price point and avoids further negotiation."
