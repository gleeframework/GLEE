Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product before anyone else. I think you'll find it's a great deal at $120."", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.
* **Reasonable Markup:** Starting with a $20 markup (from your minimum of $100) is a common tactic to test the waters without being overly aggressive.
* **First-Mover Advantage:**  Highlighting that Bob has the first opportunity creates a sense of exclusivity and potential loss if he declines."
