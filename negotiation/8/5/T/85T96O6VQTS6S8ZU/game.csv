"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm,  $160 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $160 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $145. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $145 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm happy to pay $140 for the product, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",140.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $140 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to compromise and sell it to you for $142.50. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",142.5,Alice,5,
