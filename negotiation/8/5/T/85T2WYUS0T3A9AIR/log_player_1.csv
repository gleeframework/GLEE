Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you.  I'm willing to offer it at the price of $14,000. Let me know if you're interested."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed offer of $15,000 from John, it's worth trying to sell to Bob for a higher price first.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The price of $14,000 is still significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($8,000). However, it leaves room for negotiation and makes the offer seem more appealing. 
* **Creating Urgency:**  By mentioning ""exclusive opportunity,"" I aim to create a sense of urgency, potentially prompting Bob to make a decision quickly.

By starting with a higher offer, I have room to negotiate downwards if needed, potentially still getting a better price than John's offer."
