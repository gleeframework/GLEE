"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really like it. I'm asking for $110, but I'm open to negotiation."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value ($100) to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. I've also included a friendly message to build rapport and indicate my willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a higher price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $90 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my original asking price. How about $105? I think this is a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 105}
``` 
 
I'm counteroffering with a price slightly lower than my initial offer but still above Bob's offer. I'm trying to find a middle ground while remaining firm on my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $97.50. I'm willing to pay $97.50 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100, and considering the time constraints and the possibility of selling to John for $100, accepting his offer seems like the best option. I can get a decent price for the product and close the deal without further negotiation."
