"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's desired price. There are 9 more rounds to negotiate, so it's worth exploring if a lower price is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. Offering $950,000 is a substantial drop from Alice's initial price. This initial counteroffer shows Bob's willingness to negotiate and could potentially start a fruitful conversation. It's still above Bob's ideal price, leaving room for further negotiation in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is now within Bob's budget and only $50,000 higher than John's offer.  While further negotiation is possible, it's not clear if a better offer is likely. There are still 7 rounds left, but it's unlikely Bob will be able to secure a price much lower than this.  Accepting the offer minimizes risk and saves time."
