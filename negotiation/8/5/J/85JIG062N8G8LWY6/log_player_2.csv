Alice's offer of $800,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  I want to see if I can get a better price before committing."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within a budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you a counteroffer of $750,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think?
