"Thank you for considering my interest in your product. I appreciate the value you're offering, but I believe we can reach a more reasonable agreement. Based on my research and budget, I would like to propose a price of $1500000 for the product.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm glad you're willing to make an offer. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1500000. I'm willing to come down to $1700000, but I think that's as low as I can go. What are your thoughts?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for adjusting your offer. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $1600000 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle and allows us to move forward.",1600000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're able to keep negotiating. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $1650000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",1650000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your willingness to negotiate further, Alice. I respect your position and am willing to propose a final offer of $1625000 for the product. This price reflects a compromise that I believe benefits both parties.",1625000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're able to keep the conversation going. I'm willing to meet you at $1625000, but I'd like to add a condition: I'll throw in some additional support and maintenance services for the product, which I think will be valuable to you. I'll sell the product to you for $1625000, but I'll also include a year's worth of warranty and priority support. What do you think?",1625000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your proposal, Alice. I appreciate the additional services you're offering. I would like to counter with a price of $1600000 for the product, without the extra services. This price reflects my valuation of the product alone, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1600000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save on the extra services, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sacrifice the value I'm offering. I'm willing to compromise on the price, but I still want to include the warranty and support. I'll sell the product to you for $1620000, which is $5000 more than your last offer, and I'll include the year's worth of warranty and priority support. What do you think?",1620000.0,Alice,9,

"Thank you for your continued flexibility, Alice. I appreciate the effort to meet in the middle. I would like to counter with a price of $1610000 for the product, without the extra services. This price reflects my valuation of the product alone, and I believe it's a fair compromise given our previous discussions.",1610000.0,Bob,10,
