# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product at a special starting price of $20,000. I think you'll find it's a fantastic deal for the value it provides.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly lower than what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $14,000?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best possible price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,000 is still a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This is a very fair offer, considering the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500

While Alice is coming closer to a reasonable price, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation. John's offer of $12,000 ensures I get the product without potentially going over budget."
