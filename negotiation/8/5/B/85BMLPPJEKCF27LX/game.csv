"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While it sounds amazing, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $10,500. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we split the difference at $9,250? That's a fair deal for both of us.",9250.0,Bob,4,,

"I like where you're going with the compromise, Bob, but I'm still a bit below my minimum. I can do $9,500, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,250 and $10,000.",9500.0,Alice,5,,
