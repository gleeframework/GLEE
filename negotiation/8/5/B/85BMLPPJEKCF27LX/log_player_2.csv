Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $10,500. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like where you're going with the compromise, Bob, but I'm still a bit below my minimum. I can do $9,500, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,250 and $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

It's clear Alice is very reluctant to go below $9,500.  At this point, the potential savings of another round of negotiation aren't worth the risk of her not budging further.  Buying from John for $10,000 ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price."
