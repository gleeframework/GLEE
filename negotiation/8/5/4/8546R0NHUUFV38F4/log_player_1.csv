"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $10,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $10,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Showing Flexibility:** I'm letting Bob know I'm open to negotiating, making him more likely to engage.
* **Building Rapport:** Starting with a friendly message helps build rapport and sets a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $8,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. There are still 8 rounds left, and I can make counteroffers.
* **John is a Backup:** While John offers a guaranteed $12,000, it's still worth exploring if I can get closer to that price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,500 is lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Proposal:** I'm making a counter-proposal that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price.
* **Seeking Agreement:** I'm expressing a willingness to reach an agreement, showing flexibility and a positive attitude."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing the product if we can meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** $9,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Potential for Loss:**  If I reject Bob's offer, there's a chance I might not be able to get a better price in the remaining rounds. 
* **Time Pressure:** We're already halfway through the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing a sale altogether. 
* **John's Offer is Secure:** If I need to, I can always sell to John for $12,000, so accepting Bob's offer is a safe bet."
