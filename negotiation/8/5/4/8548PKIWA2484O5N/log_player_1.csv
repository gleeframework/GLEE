Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be very valuable to you.  Let's work something out."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet somewhere in the middle, say around $650,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
$650,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I need to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $650,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. This offer is valid for a limited time. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. While I see the value in the product, $900,000 is still a stretch for me. Would you be willing to consider $725,000? That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $725,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still far from my target.  I need to see if I can push Bob a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $725,000 is still too far below what this product is worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway on my last offer, at $850,000. This is a significant concession, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement soon. "", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $850,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we split the difference again and settle at $787,500? That seems like a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $787,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $787,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$787,500 is still too low. I'm not willing to drop below $800,000, and I'm hoping that with a little more negotiation, Bob will see the value of the product and come closer to that. I'm still considering selling to John if we don't reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $787,500 is simply not a viable price for me.  It's crucial for me to get at least $800,000 for this product. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $800,000. It's a fair price for both of us, considering the value and potential of this product.  Please let me know if you're willing to accept this offer. We're getting close to the end of our negotiation, so I'm hoping we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}
