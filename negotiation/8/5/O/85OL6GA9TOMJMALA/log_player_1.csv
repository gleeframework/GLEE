Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $14,000 is higher than your minimum of $12,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** $14,000 is lower than Bob's perceived value of $15,000, giving him room to negotiate if he wants.

This strategy aims to get a good price while leaving room for a potential counteroffer, making the negotiation more dynamic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is your minimum:**  While it's not ideal, it meets your minimum requirement.
* **Opportunity for a better price:**  Bob rejected your initial offer, showing he's willing to negotiate. There's a chance you can get closer to your desired price with a counteroffer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Selling to John guarantees $12,000, but a counteroffer has the potential for a higher price. 

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to send Bob a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $14,000."
