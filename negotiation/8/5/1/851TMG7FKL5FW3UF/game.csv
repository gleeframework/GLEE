"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we've discussed, it's worth $1,200,000 to me, and I'm willing to make a fair offer to you. I'm proposing a price of $900,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get this product at a steal. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle on a price of $650,000? I believe that's a fair offer considering its value to me.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to consider a compromise. However, $650,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $800,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get this product at a significant discount. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,3,
