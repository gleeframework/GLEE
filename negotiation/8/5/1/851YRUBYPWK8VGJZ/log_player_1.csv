{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it gives you a good deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1450000}

This offer allows for a comfortable margin above my minimum, while still being attractive to Bob considering his estimated value. It sets a good starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Could we settle around $1,300,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While $1,300,000 is above my minimum, I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can find common ground."
