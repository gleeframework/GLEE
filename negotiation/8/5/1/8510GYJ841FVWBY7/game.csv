"Hi Alice, $12000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $8000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, but $8000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $10000. Let me know if that works for you.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $8000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,4,
