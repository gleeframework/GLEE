"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested, but $115 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to do $105? ",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand that $115 might be a bit high. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $110. Let's make this deal happen!",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I'm still interested, but $110 is a bit too steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? This would be a good deal for both of us!",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting closer to your offer, but $107.50 still feels a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $109. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us!",109.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $109 is still a little out of my budget. Let's meet at $108. This would be a fair deal for both of us and close this deal.",108.0,Bob,6,
