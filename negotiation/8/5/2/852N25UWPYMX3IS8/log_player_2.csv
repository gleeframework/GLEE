"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a decent price, there's room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. $11,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer close to his target price of $10,000, but not going too low to risk Alice rejecting the offer outright.  This counteroffer signals Bob's serious interest while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is unfortunately not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,800, which is still a great deal for a product like this.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best deal possible.  While $10,800 is getting closer to his budget, he's still willing to try and negotiate a lower price. There's still room to bring the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,800 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $10,600? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10600}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to inch closer to his target price of $10,000, but is still leaving room for Alice to come down slightly.  The offer also includes a positive message to keep the negotiation amicable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $10,600 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,700 as a final compromise. It's a fair price for both of us, and I hope we can reach an agreement.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,700 is only $700 over Bob's target price of $10,000. This is a good deal for Bob, considering he could buy from John for $10,000.  It's likely that further negotiation will only lead to more time and frustration with no guarantee of a better price.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product with a reasonable price."
