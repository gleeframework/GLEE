"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $11,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500. Let's see if we can make this work.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is unfortunately not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,800, which is still a great deal for a product like this.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,800 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $10,600? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",10600.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,600 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,700 as a final compromise. It's a fair price for both of us, and I hope we can reach an agreement.  Let me know your thoughts.",10700.0,Alice,5,
