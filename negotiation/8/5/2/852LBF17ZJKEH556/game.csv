"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price that's slightly lower than its true value to you. I'm offering the product to you for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,,

"Alice, I appreciate you offering the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  Given its value to me, I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,050,000.  This price reflects a fair compromise and allows both of us to benefit from the transaction.",1050000.0,Bob,2,,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it's worth the extra $50,000.",1150000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,150,000 is still a bit outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000.  This price reflects a significant compromise, and I believe it's fair for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1075000.0,Bob,4,,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $1,180,000. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and the negotiations we've had so far. Let's meet in the middle and make a deal!",1180000.0,Alice,5,,
