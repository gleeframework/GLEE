Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure if you can meet me there.

``` 
I'm not going to accept Bob's offer yet. I'm still hoping to get closer to my ideal price. I'll try to counteroffer to get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85, which is the highest I'm willing to go.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $85 is better than $80, I'm still hoping to get closer to $95.  I'll try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have your budget, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go down to $90. This is a fair price for the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 90}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $90. How about we meet in the middle at $87.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

I'm going to sell the product to John for $120.  While $87.50 is better than $85, it's still a significant drop from my ideal price and I'm running out of rounds. It's better to secure a sale with John at my minimum price than to risk getting a lower offer from Bob."
