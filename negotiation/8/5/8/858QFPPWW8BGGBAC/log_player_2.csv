Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this, but your offer is too far from what I can accept.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have other options, and I respect your time. Let's make this simple: $1,400,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the true value of what I'm offering. If you're not able to agree, I wish you the best in your search.

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice. She's shown she's unwilling to come close to your budget. You've given a fair offer at your maximum price, and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a satisfactory result. John offers a guaranteed purchase at your target price, making it the most logical decision now."
