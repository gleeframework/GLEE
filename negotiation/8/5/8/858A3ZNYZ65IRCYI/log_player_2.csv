"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its potential, I'm offering it at $11,500.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating. There are 9 rounds remaining, giving Bob ample opportunity to try and push the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting his negotiation by offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above Alice's minimum acceptable price. This shows Bob is serious about buying the product but also that he's not willing to pay top dollar. By offering $10,500, Bob is giving Alice room to counter without immediately going to John for the $12,000 deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob another chance to try and get a better deal. He can use the remaining rounds to see if he can get closer to his ideal price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $11,000 is still a little high for me. Let's try $10,750. I'm really interested in this product, and I think this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's offering a price that's closer to Alice's last offer but still within his budget. By suggesting a price that's a compromise, Bob shows a willingness to negotiate while maintaining his goal of getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your persistence.  I value this product highly, and I believe $10,900 represents a fair deal for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target price.  At $10,900, the product is still within Bob's budget and only $400 more than his last counteroffer.  With only 5 rounds remaining, it's a good idea for Bob to take the offer.  There's a chance he could get a better price, but the risk of not securing the deal is higher.  John's offer of $12,000 is still a worse option than Alice's current offer."
