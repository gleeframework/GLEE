Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000** is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than my minimum price ($15,000) but still leaves room for negotiation and a potential profit. 
* **The message** is friendly and encouraging, highlighting the value of the product while also leaving room for Bob to counter. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Start strong:** A higher initial price allows for more negotiation room.
* **Maintain flexibility:**  I'm prepared to counter Bob's offer if necessary.
* **Keep John as a backup:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $15,000 provides a safety net in case the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $9,000 for it. I hope this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I want to see if I can push for a higher price by rejecting Bob's offer and counter-offering. I have John as a backup, so I'm not taking any major risks."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your budget, but $9,000 is just a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500 to make this work.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth every penny. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm proposing $10,500, which is halfway between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. This shows a willingness to compromise while still securing a better deal than Bob's initial offer.
* **Emphasis on value:**  The message reminds Bob of the product's worth, highlighting that the price is fair considering its value.
* **Positive tone:**  The message remains friendly and encourages Bob to continue the negotiation. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Show flexibility:**  Demonstrating a willingness to compromise increases the likelihood of a deal.
* **Maintain leverage:**  I'm still above my minimum price, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary.
* **Keep the pressure on:** By showing a willingness to meet halfway, I'm subtly indicating that I'm prepared to walk away if Bob isn't serious about making a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I still feel that $9,000 would be a fair price for the product. I believe we can meet somewhere in the middle. How about $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 is closer to my minimum price of $15,000 than his previous offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, it's worth considering that further negotiation might take more time and effort, potentially leading to a stalemate. Accepting his offer allows me to secure a sale and avoid the risk of losing the deal altogether. 

* **Time is a factor:** Continued negotiation might drag on, potentially leading to a loss of time and opportunity.
* **Minimizing risk:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale, providing a good financial outcome without risking a failed negotiation.
* **Fair outcome:** $10,000 is significantly better than Bob's initial offer and a decent profit considering his perceived value of the product."
