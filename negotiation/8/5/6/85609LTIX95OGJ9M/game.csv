"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your budget, but $9,000 is just a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500 to make this work.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth every penny. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I still feel that $9,000 would be a fair price for the product. I believe we can meet somewhere in the middle. How about $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
