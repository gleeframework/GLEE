Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. How about we start the conversation at $600,000?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $600,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to be flexible. I can do $850,000, which is the highest I can go for now. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Alice is coming down, $850,000 is still above our fallback price with John. There's room to negotiate further."

{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be frank, I have a hard limit at $800,000.  If you're willing to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today."",

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $800,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make up for the difference somehow. How about we do $920,000, and I'll throw in some additional support and services that will make the product even more valuable to you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice is unlikely to budge significantly from her current position. We've reached a point where the added ""value"" she's offering doesn't justify the price difference compared to John's offer. It's time to cut our losses and secure the product at our target price."
