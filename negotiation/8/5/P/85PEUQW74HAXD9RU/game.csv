"I'm excited to offer you the product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly higher than my minimum price, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, but $850,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with $925,000. This is a fair price that should work for both of us.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $890,000? That's a significant step towards your price, and I think it's a fair deal.",890000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $890,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll counter with $920,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",920000.0,Alice,5,
