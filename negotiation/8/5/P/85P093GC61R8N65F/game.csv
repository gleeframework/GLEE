"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,000 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to go down to $10,500. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to both get a good deal.  What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still interested in the product, Alice, but I need to be more comfortable with the price. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  While $9,750 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to make one final concession.  How about $10,250? This is a good middle ground, and it allows us to both walk away feeling like we got a fair deal.  Let me know what you think.",10250.0,Alice,7,
