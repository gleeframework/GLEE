"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe the product has great potential, but I'm trying to stay within a tighter budget. Is there any flexibility on your end to meet me at this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position on the price.  While $1,350,000 represents a fair valuation of the product's potential, I'm willing to adjust to find common ground. How about we meet halfway and settle at $1,275,000? This reflects my desire to see this valuable product in your hands while still acknowledging its inherent worth.",1275000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above $1,275,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,225,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your candor and your continued interest in the product. It's clear to me that you recognize its potential value. I'm willing to come down slightly further to $1,250,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair compromise for both of us. What are your thoughts?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,225,000 and $1,250,000, so I'll offer $1,237,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1237500.0,Bob,6,
