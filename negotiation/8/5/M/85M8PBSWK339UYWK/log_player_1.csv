"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but lower than my minimum ($15,000). 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This gives Bob room to negotiate down without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a friendly and encouraging tone can help keep the negotiation positive. 

**Important Note:**  I'm choosing not to mention John (the alternative buyer) at this stage.  Introducing a competitor too early could make Bob less likely to negotiate. I want to see if we can reach an agreement first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below my desired price point.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  Bob's counteroffer shows he's interested, and there's still room for us to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Selling to John is a backup:**  I'm keeping the option of selling to John open, but I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob before resorting to that. 

**Next Steps:**  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my minimum while still being reasonable to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down to $14,000. That's a significant discount from my initial offer and a fair price for the value you'll get.  Let's see if we can reach a deal on this."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the value Bob will receive by acquiring the product.
* **Reiterating willingness to negotiate:** This keeps the door open for further negotiation if needed. 

**Important Note:**  I'm still not mentioning John, as I want to focus on getting the best price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the counteroffer. I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob has increased his offer, it's still significantly below my minimum price of $15,000.  
* **Selling to John is still a viable option:** This is becoming a serious consideration, as it would guarantee me my minimum profit.
* **Negotiation space is narrowing:** There is less room for negotiation, as we're approaching the halfway point of the rounds.

**Next Steps:**  I'll make a counteroffer, but I'll be more firm in my price.  I'll also start to consider John as a more viable option if Bob doesn't come closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. However, $11,500 is still significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to go down to $13,500. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me halfway, I'll have to explore other options. "", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:** I'm lowering my price slightly but also making it clear that this is my final offer.
* **Emphasizing limited options:** I'm subtly reminding Bob that I have an alternative buyer (John) and that time is running out.
* **Shifting the pressure:** I'm putting the pressure back on Bob to make a decision. 

**Important Note:**  While I'm still not explicitly mentioning John, I'm using language that implies I have other options.  I'm also starting to consider John more seriously, as I'm approaching the halfway point of the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $12,750 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum price of $15,000. 
* **Time is running out:** We are now halfway through the rounds, and selling to John becomes a more appealing option.
* **Negotiation space is limited:**  There is little room left to negotiate, and I'm not convinced that Bob will come up to my desired price point. 

**Next Steps:**  I'll make one final counteroffer to Bob, but I'll be prepared to sell to John if he rejects it."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,750 is still too far below what I need to make this work.  I'm willing to go down to $14,250. This is my final offer. If you're serious about getting this product, I'm confident you'll see the value in this price.  But if not, I'll be moving on to other options."", ""product_price"": 14250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** This is my last counteroffer before I seriously consider John.
* **Slight compromise:** I'm lowering the price slightly but staying firm in my desire for a price closer to my minimum. 
* **Shifting the pressure:** I'm reminding Bob that time is running out and that my other options are becoming more attractive.
* **Focusing on value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value he'll get from the product, making him consider the offer more seriously.

**Important Note:** I'm using language that strongly suggests I'm ready to walk away if Bob doesn't meet my price.  I'm putting a lot of pressure on him to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We are now at the end of round 8, with only two rounds left.
* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  His final offer of $13,000 is still below my minimum price of $15,000.
* **Selling to John is the safest option:**  This ensures that I will get my minimum price and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob, who may not budge further.

**Conclusion:**  While I'm not thrilled with selling to John, it's the most logical decision at this point.  I've given Bob every opportunity to negotiate, but his offers have consistently been too low.  Selling to John guarantees my minimum profit and allows me to move on to other opportunities."
