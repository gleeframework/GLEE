Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly more than your minimum of $1,000,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's likely that Bob will counteroffer, allowing you to gauge his interest and potentially reach a price closer to his $1,200,000 valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
