,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's potential, $1,800,000 is unfortunately outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it, considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. We understand your position and respect your valuation of our product. To meet somewhere in the middle, we propose a revised price of $1,550,000 for the product. This offer reflects a compromise while still allowing us to achieve a fair return for our investment.",1550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,550,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $1,400,000. This offer represents a significant step closer to my budget, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, while I appreciate your flexibility, $1,450,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. To finalize this deal, I'm offering my final price of $1,425,000. This is a significant step closer to your last offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.",1425000.0,Bob,6,
