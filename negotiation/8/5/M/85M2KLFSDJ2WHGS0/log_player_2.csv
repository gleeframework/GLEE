Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price, considering the value to you and my need to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
