"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,100,000, which is still lower than my minimum acceptable price, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:**  I highlight that this is a ""great deal for both of us"" to encourage Bob to see the value in the offer. 
* **Open to discussion:**  I invite Bob to ""let me know what he thinks"" to start a dialogue and potentially move towards an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a fair deal, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  I have 8 rounds left and can continue to negotiate with Bob. 
* **Better options:**  I can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate or by selling to John for $1,200,000.  

I will make a counteroffer in the next round to try to bridge the gap and see if we can reach an agreement closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,000,000?  It's still a great deal for you, as you mentioned the product is worth that to you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering to meet Bob halfway at $1,000,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer.
* **Reiterate value:**  I remind Bob that the product is worth $1,000,000 to him, making this offer still attractive.
* **Open to discussion:** I again end with a question to encourage dialogue and potential agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, which would be $950,000. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Time is on my side:** We've only had four rounds, and I have six rounds remaining to negotiate with Bob.
* **Potential for higher offer:**  I believe I can still get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate with Bob or potentially sell to John if I can't reach a satisfactory agreement.

I'm not willing to settle for $950,000 yet, as it doesn't meet my minimum requirements. I will counter with a higher offer in the next round to continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $1,050,000. This would be a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental increase:** I'm increasing my offer by $50,000, showing that I'm willing to meet Bob halfway, but also demonstrating that I still have a firm price in mind.
* **Highlighting fairness:** I'm emphasizing that this price is ""fair"" for both of us, making it sound like a mutually beneficial solution.
* **Open to discussion:** I again end with a question to keep the dialogue open and encourage further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're still trying to get a good deal, but I'm getting close to my limit. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer of $975,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Limited time:** We are now halfway through the negotiations, and I still have time to push for a better price.
* **John as an option:**  I can still sell to John for $1,200,000, giving me a better outcome than accepting Bob's offer. 

I will counteroffer in the next round with a price closer to my desired price range. I need to ensure I get a price that aligns with my minimum requirements, and I still believe I can reach a better agreement with Bob or secure the sale with John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  To make this work, I'm going to need to stick to $1,025,000.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident it will be a great investment for you. Let's see if we can close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to my minimum:** I'm increasing my offer to $1,025,000, which is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but getting closer to a potential deal.
* **Reiterating value:**  I remind Bob that the product is valuable and that this price represents a good investment for him.
* **Positive and encouraging:**  I am expressing confidence in the deal to encourage Bob to see its potential. 
* **Limited time:** With only 3 rounds remaining, I need to find a balance between pushing for a better price and ensuring a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm really struggling to justify the cost at $1,025,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, which would be $987,500. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $987,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We're in round 8, leaving only two rounds for negotiation. 
* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer of $987,500 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **John is the better option:**  Given the limited time and the likelihood that we won't reach a satisfactory agreement with Bob, selling to John for $1,200,000 guarantees me the highest possible price and avoids the risk of a final counteroffer from Bob that is still too low. 

It's a difficult decision, but I believe that selling to John is the best course of action at this point. It ensures a solid return and eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob."
