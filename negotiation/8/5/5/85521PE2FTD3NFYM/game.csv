,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $18,000 is unfortunately above my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $12,000 at this time.  This is my maximum price, let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm now offering the product to you for $16,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $12,000. This is my absolute maximum, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement. What do you say?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm now offering the product to you for $14,500. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",14500.0,Alice,5,
