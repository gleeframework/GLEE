"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $80 for it. Is there any way we could come to an agreement at that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to at least get $100 for this.  Let me know if you're interested in that.",100.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $100 is still above my budget, I would like to propose $90 as the price for the product. This feels like a fair compromise given the value you're offering. Please let me know if this works for you.",90.0,Bob,4,
