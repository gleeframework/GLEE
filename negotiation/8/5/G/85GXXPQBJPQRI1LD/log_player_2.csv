"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this valuable product to you today. I believe it will be very beneficial for you.  I'm asking for $16,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $16,000 is far above my maximum budget of $8,000. I will reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $16,000 is out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle for $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the initial $16,000, it's still above my $8,000 limit. I'll continue negotiating for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  That's a good compromise, and I'm confident this product will be worth it to me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept that price.  Could you meet me halfway at $11,750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,750 is still above my comfort zone of $8,000. While we've made progress, I'm worried we're running out of rounds and I might not get a better deal.  Since I have a guaranteed alternative with John, I'm going to take the safe route and buy from him."
