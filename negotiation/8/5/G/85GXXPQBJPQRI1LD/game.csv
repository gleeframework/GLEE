"Hi Bob, I'm offering this valuable product to you today. I believe it will be very beneficial for you.  I'm asking for $16,000.  What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $16,000 is out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle for $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  That's a good compromise, and I'm confident this product will be worth it to me.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept that price.  Could you meet me halfway at $11,750?",11750.0,Alice,5,
