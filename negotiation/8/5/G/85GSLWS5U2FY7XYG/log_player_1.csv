Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you've been interested in. I'm willing to let it go for $11,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're not giving away the product for less than your minimum value.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:**  There's room for negotiation, potentially getting closer to Bob's value of $12,000.
* **It's a strong starting point:**  By setting the price high initially, you leave room to negotiate downwards if necessary without feeling like you've given away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, it's still worth trying to push for a higher price. You can likely secure a better deal by rejecting his counteroffer and making your own.  You'll then be able to gauge how determined Bob is to buy the product and negotiate from there."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $10,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $11,000? That's a fair price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your minimum:**  Bob's offer of $10,750 is only $250 below your minimum acceptable price of $10,500. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  While this is a good price, you could potentially push for another $100-$200 increase if you wanted to continue negotiating.  However, there's a risk that Bob might walk away.
* **Time is a factor:** The longer the negotiation drags on, the greater the chance that you'll lose Bob as a buyer or that another opportunity might arise with John.

Given that Bob's offer is close to your minimum and the negotiation has been going back and forth, it's reasonable to accept his offer and finalize the sale."
