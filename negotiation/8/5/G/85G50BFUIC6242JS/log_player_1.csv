I believe it holds significant value for you, and after careful consideration, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, but I'm confident this is a fair starting point given its potential."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  $1,300,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  This reflects its value to me and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. I'm confident this product can bring you substantial returns on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the product's worth."",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while remaining within my budget.  Let's work together to make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $1,100,000 is a good offer, I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob. We're getting closer, and I want to see if I can push for a bit more before accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,175,000. This feels like a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1175000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down.  $1,175,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,125,000.  This feels like a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  $1,125,000 is a strong offer and represents a significant profit above my minimum acceptable price. While I might be able to squeeze a bit more out of the negotiation, there's also the risk that Bob walks away if I push too hard. Accepting this offer guarantees a good deal and avoids the potential of losing the sale altogether."
