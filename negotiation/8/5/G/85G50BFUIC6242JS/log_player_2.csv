"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and after careful consideration, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, but I'm confident this is a fair starting point given its potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $1,300,000 is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Alice states she's open to discussion, so there's room to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Time to counter:**  You have 10 rounds, so rejecting the initial offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  $1,300,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  This reflects its value to me and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. I'm confident this product can bring you substantial returns on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still too high:** $1,200,000 is still above my budget and doesn't represent a significant enough concession from her initial price.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** Alice is willing to negotiate, and we've already established a potential range between $1,000,000 and $1,300,000.
* **More rounds to go:** With 7 rounds left, I have time to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,175,000. This feels like a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While it's closer to my budget, $1,175,000 is still above my preferred price range. 
* **Negotiation is still ongoing:** Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Time to push for a better deal:**  With 5 rounds remaining, I can afford to continue negotiating and see if I can get Alice to drop her price further."
