"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and after careful consideration, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, but I'm confident this is a fair starting point given its potential.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  $1,300,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  This reflects its value to me and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. I'm confident this product can bring you substantial returns on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the product's worth.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while remaining within my budget.  Let's work together to make this deal happen.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,175,000. This feels like a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",1175000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down.  $1,175,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,125,000.  This feels like a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget. Let's close this deal.",1125000.0,Bob,6,
