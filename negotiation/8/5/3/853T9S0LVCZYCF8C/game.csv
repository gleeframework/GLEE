"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll be getting from the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  Let's split the difference and agree on $1,050,000. This price still represents a significant discount from the true value of the product, and it allows us both to walk away happy.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $1,050,000. I'd be willing to pay $950,000, which is closer to my target price. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll be getting from the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see that we're both trying to find a price that works for both of us. While $950,000 is still lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price reflects the significant value this product will bring to your business, and it's a fair compromise considering our respective positions.  Let's close this deal and get you started with your new product!",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $1,000,000. I'd be willing to pay $980,000, which is a small compromise from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll be getting from the product.",980000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're getting closer, but $980,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's compromise at $990,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and with only 3 rounds left, I really think we should close this deal. If we don't agree, I may have to accept John's offer of $1,500,000.  Let's make this work!",990000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $990,000. I'd be willing to pay $985,000, which is a small compromise from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll be getting from the product.",985000.0,Bob,8,
