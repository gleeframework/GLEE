Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, but I'm confident this is a fair price.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($8,000). This gives me room to negotiate and still make a profit. 
* **Appealing to Bob's Value:** I mention the product's high value to Bob, reminding him of the potential benefit he'll gain.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message ends with an open invitation for negotiation, showing willingness to reach a compromise. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob Accepts:** I've secured a good price and a sale.
* **If Bob Rejects:** I will analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter with a lower offer, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  I appreciate the offer but $12000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is lower than my desired profit:** While $10,000 is better than selling to John, it's still not as profitable as I'd like.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still space for negotiation. I can counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to reach a compromise.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling to John guarantees $8,000, but there's a chance I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price between $10,000 and $12,000, hoping to find a mutually agreeable middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your perspective. While I'd like to get closer to my initial price, I'm willing to compromise. How about $11,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, demonstrating my willingness to meet him halfway.
* **Emphasis on fairness:**  I highlight the ""fairness"" of the price, appealing to Bob's sense of reason and potentially making him feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Urgency:** I mention closing the deal quickly, subtly putting pressure on Bob to accept. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob Accepts:** I've secured a good price that's above my minimum while ensuring the sale goes through.
* **If Bob Rejects:** I'll need to assess the situation:
    * If he makes another low counteroffer, I'll consider selling to John to avoid getting stuck in a lengthy negotiation. 
    * If he offers closer to $11,000, I'll be more open to further negotiation."
