I'm going to reject Alice's offer. It's too high for my budget. I want to see if I can get a better deal from Alice before buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm offering $75 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. Hopefully, Alice will accept my counteroffer."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm still going to reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to my budget, I'm not willing to pay that much yet. I'm hoping I can negotiate a lower price or maybe Alice will get desperate and accept my previous offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $80. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.  Hopefully, Alice will finally see reason and accept this offer."
