Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $11,500 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down slightly.
* **Higher than John's Offer:**  The offer is significantly higher than John's $10,000 offer, ensuring Alice doesn't sell for less than her minimum. 

This strategy balances ambition with a realistic chance of securing the sale at a price favorable to Alice."
