"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $600,000. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $600,000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to compromise. I'll offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a significant price reduction and allows for some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable solution.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. I believe this is a fair price that considers the value of the product and allows us both to benefit from this deal.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $700,000 is still a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'll offer the product for $900,000.  This price represents a considerable reduction from my initial asking price and should allow us to come to an agreement.  What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,5,
