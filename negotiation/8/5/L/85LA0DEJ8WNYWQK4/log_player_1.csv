Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. Any offer above this has the potential to be accepted.
* **The ""Zone of Possible Agreement"":**  Exists between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999.  This is where a mutually beneficial deal can happen.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob feeling like he's getting a reasonable deal.  Going too close to his maximum value ($1,200,000) leaves money on the table.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its features and your specific needs, I believe it's a perfect fit. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  Confidently stating the product's value to Bob.
* **Justification:**  While not revealing your bottom line, you're implying this is a considered price.
* **Urgency:**  The ""limited-time offer"" adds a gentle pressure to decide without seeming overly aggressive.

**Important Note:** Negotiation is dynamic. Bob might counter-offer.  Be prepared to adjust your price slightly, but remember your walk-away point is $1,500,000."
