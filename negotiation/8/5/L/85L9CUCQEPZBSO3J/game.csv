"Bob, I'm happy to offer you this valuable product for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you. Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we settle around $800,000?  That feels more reasonable.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, recognizing your value for the product. This is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,200,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 still falls far short of my minimum. To make this work, I'm willing to go down to $1,100,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price for the value you'll receive. Let's finalize this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate the concessions you've made so far.  To bridge the gap, how about I offer you $1,025,000? That's a strong offer and demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your commitment to this deal, and I appreciate your increased offer.  However, I'm still a bit away from my minimum. To reach an agreement, I'm willing to go down to $1,075,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it will be mutually beneficial. Let's close this deal.",1075000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, it seems like we're really close to a deal now. To show my good faith and finalize this, I'm prepared to offer you $1,050,000. I'm hoping this demonstrates how serious I am about purchasing this product from you. Let's get this done!",1050000.0,Bob,8,
