Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it will be highly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $10,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start with a higher price in negotiations. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might get a better deal if he counter-offers. 
* **Knowing the Worth:** We know Bob values the product at $8,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at that price to John.  Therefore, aiming for a price above $8,000 makes sense.
* **Politeness and Value:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value to Bob. This approach makes him more receptive to the offer. 
 
**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate if Bob rejects it. You can gradually decrease your asking price, but never go below your minimum of $8,000."
