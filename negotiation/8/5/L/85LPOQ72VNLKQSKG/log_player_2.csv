"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for an exclusive price. Given its value to you, I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I am offering it to you for $110, which is a special discount considering its worth to you. Please let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $110 is tempting, you can get the product for your maximum price of $100 from John.  There's no reason to spend more when you have a guaranteed option at a lower price."
