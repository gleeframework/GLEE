Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $130. I believe it offers significant value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($150) as possible to maximize my profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high ($130) leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, and I can still negotiate down to a price above my minimum ($80). 
* **Avoid Scarcity Tactics:** While mentioning John exists, I don't want to pressure Bob too much with a ""take it or leave it"" approach. This offer allows for a more collaborative feel.

This strategy balances maximizing potential profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
