"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What do you think?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I recognize the value of the product, $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. To make this work, I'm willing to offer $1,700,000. I believe this price is fair considering the product's value and my desired budget.",1700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I understand your position, however, I believe the product's true value warrants a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000.  This offer reflects the product's significant worth while still acknowledging your budget considerations.",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,100,000 is still above my budget.  I'm comfortable offering $1,800,000. This price reflects the value of the product while staying within my financial limitations. I hope we can come to an agreement.",1800000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,950,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $1,800,000.  To meet halfway, I'm willing to offer $1,875,000.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1875000.0,Bob,6,
