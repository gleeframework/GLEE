{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by presenting a price slightly higher than the product's value to Bob. This allows for potential negotiation and leaves room for Bob to counteroffer while still ensuring you make a profit. Remember, I have a backup buyer in John, so I'm not under pressure to accept any offer below my minimum threshold of $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, I'm only willing to pay $750,000.  This reflects the value it holds for me. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum threshold of $800,000. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round. I still have John as a backup buyer, so I'm in a strong position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $825,000. This reflects the fact that I value your business and hope we can reach an agreement.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 825000}
``` 

This counteroffer demonstrates flexibility while still staying above my minimum threshold. It shows Bob that I'm open to negotiation but also that I'm not willing to settle for a significantly lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $825,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to go to $780,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum threshold, it's still below $800,000. I'm going to reject his offer and make another counteroffer. I'm still in a good position with John as a backup buyer, and I believe I can negotiate a better price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. $780,000 is still a bit too low for me. To show my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to go down to $805,000. This is a significant compromise, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 805000}
```

This counteroffer further demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, but it also keeps the price close to my minimum threshold. This approach aims to create a sense of urgency and potentially lead to a final agreement in this round."
