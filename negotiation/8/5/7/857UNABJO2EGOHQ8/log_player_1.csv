"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm open to negotiation, $900,000 is too far below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 simply isn't enough.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to lower my price to $1,100,000. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I appreciate Bob's willingness to increase his offer, $950,000 is still below my minimum price point. I will counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your position, but $950,000 still doesn't reflect the value of this product.  Let's try to close the gap.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's worth to you, while also allowing me to achieve a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I've had six rounds of negotiation, and I'm not confident that we will reach a mutually acceptable agreement.  It's time to move on and sell the product to John for $1,000,000."
