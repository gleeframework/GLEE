"Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is unfortunately outside of my budget. Given the value you've described, I'm willing to offer $1,800,000.  This reflects the product's worth while staying within my financial constraints. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,800,000 undervalues it considerably. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $2,050,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your initial offer.",2050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $2,050,000 is still beyond my budget. To find common ground, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,900,000. This is a significant step closer to your position while remaining within my financial constraints.  Let's see if we can reach a final agreement.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we are getting close. I value your willingness to negotiate and I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.  To show my commitment, I'm willing to come down to $1,975,000. This is my final offer, as it reflects the absolute lowest price I can accept while still honoring the product's true value.",1975000.0,Alice,5,
