"Hello Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go down to $950,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'm thinking of a price of $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
