"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, and I believe it would be equally valuable for your business.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its potential, and I'm confident you'll see a strong return on your investment. Let me know your thoughts!",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $900,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I value your business, $750,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $825,000.  This reflects the product's value and gives you a good deal. Let's see if we can close this deal.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget, and I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $775,000 for the product. This is the highest I can go, and I hope you can consider it.",775000.0,Bob,4,
