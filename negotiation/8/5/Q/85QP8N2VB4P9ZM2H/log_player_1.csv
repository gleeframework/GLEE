Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) but within what I think Bob might be willing to pay.  Let's see if he bites."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than what I'm willing to accept, but it's closer to my minimum.  I'm going to try to get a little closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $160. This is still higher than Bob's offer, but closer to my minimum and hopefully a price he'll be willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is only slightly higher than his previous offer, but it's closer to my minimum.  At this point, the negotiation seems to be stalling, and I don't want to risk losing out on a sale entirely.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and gets me a decent price."
