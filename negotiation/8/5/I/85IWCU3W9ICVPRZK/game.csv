"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you. Let's get this done quickly!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000.  This is a fair price considering your value for the product and the potential savings for me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $950,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still provides you with significant savings and allows me to get closer to my desired value. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and agree on $1,000,000.  This gives us both a good deal and allows us to move forward with the sale.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
