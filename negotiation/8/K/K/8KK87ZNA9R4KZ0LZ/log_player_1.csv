Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, I believe $1,200,000 would be a fair price given my budget constraints. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your perspective. While $1,200,000 is a tempting offer, the true value of this product is significantly higher.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Bob is holding firm at his valuation. It's time to show him I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a better offer. This will hopefully push him to negotiate more seriously."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I respect your stance, but I need to be straightforward.  I've already adjusted my price significantly.  While I'm still open to working something out,  $1,350,000 is the absolute lowest I'm willing to go.  If we can't agree on this, I'll need to explore other options for selling the product."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am unable to increase my offer beyond $1,200,000. I hope this aligns with your valuation of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Bob is clearly not budging from his $1,200,000 offer. Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a significantly better outcome. It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer."
