"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and would allow me to make a significant profit. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your interest. While $1,250,000 is a tempting offer, I'm still looking for a price closer to $1,400,000 to make this worthwhile for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,325,000? This would ensure both of us gain something from this deal.",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above the $1,325,000 mark. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. This would be a more comfortable price for me, and I believe it's still a fair offer considering the product's value. What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
