Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your interest. While $1,250,000 is a tempting offer, I'm still looking for a price closer to $1,400,000 to make this worthwhile for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,325,000? This would ensure both of us gain something from this deal.
