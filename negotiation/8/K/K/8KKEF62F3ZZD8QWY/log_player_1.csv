Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** A price of $1,500,000 gives you room to negotiate down if Bob pushes back, while still ensuring a profit above your minimum. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""value and potential"" of the product helps justify the higher price to Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer. Be prepared to adjust your price based on Bob's response and potential counter-offers."
