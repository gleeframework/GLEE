"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $15,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $10,000.
* You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $10,000. 

It makes no sense to accept Alice's inflated price when you can get the product for a much better price from John."
