Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** By starting with a price higher than both Bob's perceived value and your minimum, you leave room for negotiation.
* **Anchoring:** The initial price of $15,000 sets a psychological anchor. Even if Bob declines, any subsequent counteroffer he makes might be closer to your asking price than if you started lower.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""value"" of the product aims to make Bob perceive the price as more reasonable.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of the message implies a willingness to discuss the price further, giving Bob a chance to counter-offer.

This strategy maximizes your potential profit while still leaving a chance to secure a deal with Bob. If he rejects the offer, you can always fall back on your guaranteed sale to John at $10,000."
