This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $1,150,000 is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so he has room to negotiate and still get a good deal.
* **It leaves room for bargaining:** You can potentially negotiate higher if Bob is eager to buy.

By offering $1,150,000, you are maximizing your potential earnings while also leaving space for a successful negotiation with Bob."
