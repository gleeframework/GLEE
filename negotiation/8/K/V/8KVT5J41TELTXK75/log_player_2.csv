```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is once again raising his offer, but this time it's a small increment. He is showing Alice that he is serious about closing a deal and is willing to compromise.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,000,000, which is still a bit higher than Bob's target price. While he could continue to negotiate, it's likely that reaching a price under $950,000 is unlikely. Considering that John is willing to sell the product for $800,000, Bob has a better deal available.  It's more efficient to take advantage of the guaranteed lower price from John, rather than risk further rounds of negotiation with Alice."
