"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can likely get a better deal by counteroffering.  He's aiming to save as much as possible, and $1,100,000 is still above his ideal price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid $950,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the value you've mentioned you place on the product, I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. This is a fair price that still allows us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

# Alice's message: Bob, I can see you're close to your limit, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,080,000, which is still below the $1,200,000 you mentioned earlier. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value.
