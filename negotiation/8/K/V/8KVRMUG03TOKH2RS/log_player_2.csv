"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something you've been looking for, and I know you'll appreciate its quality and functionality. I'm offering it to you for $14,000.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.  Rejecting Alice's offer keeps the option open to potentially negotiate a lower price with her or to consider other sellers."
