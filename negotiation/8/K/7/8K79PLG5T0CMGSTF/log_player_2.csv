Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the initial price. However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential for generating revenue. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This offer reflects a more reasonable middle ground.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,700,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to find common ground. While $1,350,000 is a significant jump, I need to be realistic about the value this product represents. How about we settle at $1,600,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges both our positions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close, but there's still a bit of a gap.  I can do $1,400,000, but I'd be stretching my budget.   Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me to reach a deal. I understand this is a significant investment for you, and I want to make sure we find a solution that works for both of us. To show my commitment, I'm willing to come down to my absolute bottom line: $1,550,000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower than $1,550,000 and we know we can get the product for $1,200,000 from John. It's time to cut our losses and go with the guaranteed lower price."
