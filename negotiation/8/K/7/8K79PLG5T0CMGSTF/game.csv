"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm confident that this price reflects the significant return on investment you'll see.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the initial price. However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential for generating revenue. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This offer reflects a more reasonable middle ground.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,700,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to find common ground. While $1,350,000 is a significant jump, I need to be realistic about the value this product represents. How about we settle at $1,600,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges both our positions.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close, but there's still a bit of a gap.  I can do $1,400,000, but I'd be stretching my budget.   Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me to reach a deal. I understand this is a significant investment for you, and I want to make sure we find a solution that works for both of us. To show my commitment, I'm willing to come down to my absolute bottom line: $1,550,000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.",1550000.0,Alice,7,
