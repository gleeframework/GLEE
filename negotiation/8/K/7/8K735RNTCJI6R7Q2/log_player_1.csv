"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's 50% higher than my minimum value. This allows for some room to negotiate and hopefully encourages Bob to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still lower than my desired price. I'll try to get closer to my target in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $14,500,  which is a slight increase from Bob's offer. This demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate, but I still want to maximize my earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is the same as his previous offer, and it's still lower than my desired price. I'll try to counteroffer again to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14250}
```

I'm going down a little bit to show flexibility but still trying to stay above my minimum desired price.  This might incentivize Bob to move closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,950. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,950
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I don't want to settle too quickly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $14,000, meeting Bob halfway from his last offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a better deal than his last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, and Bob's offer consistently below my minimum desired price, it's becoming increasingly risky to keep negotiating. Selling to John at $10,000 ensures I receive a decent profit, and it's the most secure option at this point."
