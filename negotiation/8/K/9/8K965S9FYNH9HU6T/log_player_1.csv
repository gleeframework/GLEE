"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $15,000, but it gives me room to negotiate and potentially secure a higher price. I'll see if Bob is willing to bite."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm not going to give up on getting more.  Bob clearly values the product lower than I do, but there's still room for negotiation.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to try and reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway with a counteroffer of $17,500. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but it still gives me a profit margin. Hopefully, Bob will see the value in this offer and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $16,000 is a good compromise.  This is still significantly higher than what John is offering and I'm getting closer to my desired profit margin. I'm going to accept this offer and close the deal."
