"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

$8,000 is a good price, but it's always worth seeing if you can get it for less. There's no harm in trying to negotiate a lower price, especially since you have 10 rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a lower counteroffer of $6,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $8,000. I'm hoping to get a good deal, but I'm also mindful of the fact that I have 10 rounds to negotiate. If Alice rejects this offer, I'll adjust my counteroffer in the next round based on her response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $7,500 is a good deal, it's still higher than my ideal price. I'm going to continue negotiating, hoping to get Alice down closer to my $6,000 counteroffer. I still have plenty of rounds left to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $6,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer of $6,000 and Alice's offer of $7,500. I'm hoping that this shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but that I'm also willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $7,200 is getting closer to my desired price range. It's still a little higher than I'd like, but it's a good deal considering the limited rounds remaining.  I'm comfortable accepting this offer and securing the product before risking losing it to John or further negotiations that may not be fruitful."
