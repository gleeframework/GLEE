Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175.  It's a great deal and I think you'll really like it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $60 is far too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but it's not worth selling for that price. I'll try to get closer to my minimum price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you showing interest in the product.  While $60 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $125.  That's still a good price for a product of this quality. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However,  $125 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, maybe around $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $80 is the maximum value Bob is willing to pay, it's still below my minimum price of $150.  I'll reject the offer and try to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $80 is simply too low for me. Let's meet halfway. I'm willing to drop my price to $100.  This is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about we split the difference and settle at $90? That's a price I'm comfortable with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John. While $90 is a bit closer to my minimum, we're running out of time and I'm not confident Bob will come any higher. John is a sure thing for $150, which is my minimum acceptable price."
