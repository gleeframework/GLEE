Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. I believe this price is high enough to pique Bob's interest, but not so high that he immediately rejects it.  Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I believe I can get a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push him higher with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my desired value. I think this counteroffer shows that I'm flexible and willing to negotiate, but I'm also not willing to settle for a price too far below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is pretty close to my desired price, and I don't want to risk him walking away. I think this is a good deal for both of us, and I'm happy to accept it."
