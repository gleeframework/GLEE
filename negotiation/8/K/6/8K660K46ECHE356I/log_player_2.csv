"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for considering our product! We're excited to offer it to you at a price of $11,000. We believe this is a great value for the quality and features of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're looking to save as much money as possible, and $11,000 is still too high.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this product. However, $11,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. We appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, we're willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,800. We believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You're still trying to save as much money as possible.  $10,800 is a good price, but you're still within your budget.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the continued negotiation. I'm still hoping to get a better price.  I'm willing to pay $10,600 for the product. It's a good price for us both, and it's the final price I'm willing to pay."", ""product_price"": 10600}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your final offer. We appreciate your persistence. However, we're not willing to go below $11,200. We believe the product's value and quality justify this price. We're willing to meet you at $11,200, but no lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is not willing to go below $11,200, which is still higher than your desired price. You have 5 rounds left, but it seems like further negotiation is unlikely to get you a price lower than $11,200.  At this point, it's better to buy from John for $12,000 to guarantee the purchase within your budget."
