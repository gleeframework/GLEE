{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's higher than what the product is worth to Bob ($8,000), but still lower than your minimum value ($15,000).
* **Message:** The message is friendly and encouraging, highlighting the value proposition for Bob while setting a firm price point.

**Strategy:**

* This offer starts the negotiation by setting a clear expectation for the price. 
* It gives Bob room to counter-offer, but it also signals that you are willing to negotiate, but not willing to give it away for less than your minimum.
* If Bob rejects this offer, you can use his counteroffer to gauge his seriousness and adjust your next offer accordingly. 
* You always have the option to sell to John for $15,000, which gives you leverage throughout the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in your product, but my budget is limited. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum value ($15,000) and even lower than your initial offer ($12,000).  Rejecting his offer shows you are serious about getting a fair price and are not willing to settle for a lowball offer.

**Next Steps:**

You will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, potentially somewhere between $8,500 and $12,000. This will allow you to see if Bob is willing to negotiate further or if he is firm on his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $10,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000:** This counteroffer is a compromise, falling in the middle between your previous offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($8,500). 
* **Message:** The message remains friendly but firm, acknowledging Bob's budget concerns while emphasizing the value proposition of the product and the fairness of the new price. 

**Strategy:**

* This counteroffer shows willingness to negotiate while maintaining a price point that still exceeds your minimum value.
* It allows Bob to see that you are serious about selling but also willing to meet him halfway.
* If Bob rejects this counteroffer, you can adjust your next offer accordingly, potentially moving closer to his price or deciding to sell to John if Bob is unwilling to budge further."
