"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I'm only willing to pay up to $120. Let me know if we can reach an agreement.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $140. This is still a great deal for you, as you value the product at $100.  Let's find a way to make this work.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate it, but I still believe the product is worth less than what you're asking. I would like to propose $130 as my final offer.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $130 is still too low for me. To show you I'm serious about making a deal, I'm willing to lower my price to $135.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's finalize this sale.",135.0,Alice,5,
