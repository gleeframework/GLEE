Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:**  Our goal is to get as close to $15,000 as possible, but we need to give Bob an incentive to buy.
* **Attractive to Bob:** $14,000 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value of $12,000, but it's still a ""saving"" of $1,000.  
* **Backup Plan:** We have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, so there's no risk of losing money if Bob declines.

This offer creates a win-win scenario if Bob accepts, while still prioritizing maximizing our potential profit."
