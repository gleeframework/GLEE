"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Considering its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  While it's below Bob's maximum, there's room for negotiation to save money.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $925,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $850,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still confident in the value this product brings. I could meet you halfway between our offers at $887,500. This feels like a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's target, there's still room to negotiate further.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and rejecting the offer allows him to try and push the price down even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $887,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $870,000.  This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 870000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  How about we settle on $878,750?  This brings us closer to a midpoint and recognizes the true value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $878,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $878,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is still above Bob's ideal price, it's getting very close to his target.  Accepting this offer ensures a deal is made, saving time and avoiding the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers.  Furthermore, buying from John would cost Bob significantly more, making Alice's offer the better choice at this point."
