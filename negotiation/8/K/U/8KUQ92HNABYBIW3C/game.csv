"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $140? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 was a bit steep, but $140 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $160. Would you be interested in that price?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, $160 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $150? I'm really interested in the product and would like to make a deal.",150.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $150, as that's below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more offer to you: $165. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it.",165.0,Alice,5,
