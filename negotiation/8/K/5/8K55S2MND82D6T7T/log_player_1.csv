{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,350,000. This offer stands until [Set a reasonable deadline], after which I'll be moving forward with another interested party."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Aiming for a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) increases potential profit.
* **Negotiating Room:** The offer leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Deadline & Alternative:** The mention of a deadline and another buyer (John) creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, making the offer more enticing.
* **Respectful Tone:**  The message is framed as a valuable opportunity for Bob, fostering a positive negotiation environment."
