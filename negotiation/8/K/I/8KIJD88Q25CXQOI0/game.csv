"Thank you for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it. However, $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend at the moment.  I'd be happy to pay $135 for it.  What do you think?",135.0,Bob,2,,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $160. It's a fair price for a product of this quality, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $160 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $145? That's a fair price for both of us and we can close the deal.",145.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,155.0
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to go down to $145. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer it to you for $155. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for a product of this quality.",155.0,Alice,5,,
