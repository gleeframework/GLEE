Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  How about $1,250,000?  This is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

I'm willing to go down to $1,200,000 for this final offer. This is my absolute bottom line, and I believe it's still a good deal for both of us. What do you say?

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  Alice has come down to his maximum budget, and he can get the product at the same price as he'd get it from John. There's no benefit to continuing to negotiate."
