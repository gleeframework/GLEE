Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a fantastic product that I think you'll find very valuable. I believe it's worth at least $100, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potential profit. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning that the product is worth at least $100, Alice subtly anchors the price in Bob's mind, making the $120 seem like a less significant increase.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While Alice wants to maximize her profit, setting the price too high might make Bob immediately reject the offer. The $120 price point allows for the possibility of Bob countering with a lower price, closer to his perceived value.
* **Backup Plan:**  Alice has the security of John as a buyer at $100, so there's limited risk in aiming a bit higher with Bob."
