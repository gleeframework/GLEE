Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to spend less, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $875,000. This is the best I can do at this point.

Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product at a good price without risking a further negotiation that could potentially lead to a higher price or losing the deal altogether."
