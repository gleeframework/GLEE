"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it, which is still a good deal for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $11,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go up to $10,500. This is a fair price considering your value for the product and my budget.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,800. This is still a great price for a product of this value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the purchase.",10800.0,Alice,5,
