"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  $180 is way more than your maximum price of $100. It's always worth negotiating, especially since you have a backup option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

I'm starting with my maximum price, $100.  Since Alice knows I can get the product from John for that amount, she should be motivated to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
While $160 is closer to your maximum price, it's still more than what you're willing to pay.  You still have rounds left to negotiate and John is a good safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

I'm raising my offer slightly, but staying below the $100 I could get from John. Hopefully, this shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product, but also that I'm not willing to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $140 is tempting and getting closer to your max, it's still worth holding out. You have more rounds and a solid backup option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120} 
```

This is a significant increase from my previous offer, showing Alice that I'm willing to compromise. It's also below what she offered in the previous round, suggesting I'm making progress.  It's still well within my budget and hopefully a good starting point for the final negotiation."
