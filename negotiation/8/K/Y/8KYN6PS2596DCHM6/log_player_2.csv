"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

The offer from Alice is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $120. It's worth trying to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 60}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation.  This shows I'm serious about buying the product but also sets a clear expectation that I'm looking for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $65
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price. While I could continue negotiating, accepting her offer at $65 ensures a successful purchase within my budget and leaves room for potential future savings if I decide to purchase from Alice again."
