Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it presents significant value, even at this price point. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $15,000 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $12,000, so Alice needs to offer a price that's appealing but still profitable.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $14,500 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.  
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Alice has a safety net with John, ensuring she won't go below $15,000 if Bob declines."
