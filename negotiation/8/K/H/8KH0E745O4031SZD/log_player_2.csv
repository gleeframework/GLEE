"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value to you, I suggest we start with an offer of $12,000. This allows us to maintain a fair transaction while maximizing my earnings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While $12,000 is less than your maximum, it's still a significant amount.
* **Negotiation potential:** You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so there's room to get a better price.
* **Avoiding John:**  Buying from John immediately would cost you the most. 

**Next Step:** You should make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to Alice's value of $8,000."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it.  This price is fair for both of us, and allows us to move forward with the transaction."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's still above her value. This shows you're serious about buying but also willing to negotiate.
* **Middle ground:** $9,500 is roughly in the middle of Alice's value and your maximum, indicating you're willing to compromise.
* **Setting the stage:**  This counteroffer starts the negotiation process, forcing Alice to respond and potentially leading to a mutually beneficial outcome."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. In light of this, I propose a counteroffer of $10,500 for the product. This allows us to reach a compromise that respects both our interests.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

* **Avoiding John:** Buying from John now would cost you a significant amount compared to what you could potentially get from Alice.

**Next Step:**  Make another counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to your target range. Consider offering $9,750 or $10,000 to bridge the gap further and encourage Alice to accept."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:** This counteroffer moves closer to Alice's offer while still being within your desired price range. It shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining a firm stance:** While offering a slightly higher price, the message emphasizes that you are still striving for a fair deal.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your response, Bob. Let's aim for a mutual agreement. Considering our previous discussions, I propose a counteroffer of $10,250 for the product. This price reflects a compromise that respects both our interests and could potentially lead to a successful transaction.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** Although it's closer to your desired price, $10,250 is still significantly higher than your target.
* **Remaining rounds:**  You still have 5 rounds left, which means there's time to negotiate further and potentially reach a more favorable price.
* **Avoiding John:** Buying from John at this point would be a costly decision considering the potential for a better price from Alice.
