"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 
 
I'm going to start high, aiming for my minimum value. If Bob rejects, I'll have to negotiate, but I have the option of going to John if things get too difficult."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. While I can sell to John for $1,200,000, I want to see if I can get closer to that number with Bob.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway, offering a price that is still above his offer but closer to my minimum value. This might encourage him to come up a bit in the next round."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is still significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm getting closer to selling to John.  I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm going to drop my price again, but only slightly. I'm getting close to my minimum value and I need to gauge Bob's willingness to come up. If he rejects this offer, I'll likely sell to John."

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is still stubbornly low. I'm running out of rounds, and I don't think I can get close to my desired value.  I'm going to sell to John and guarantee my minimum."
