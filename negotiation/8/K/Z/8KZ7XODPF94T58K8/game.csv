"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $10000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $15000.  This is still a great deal for you, and it's a price that I'm comfortable with.  Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm willing to be flexible. I can't quite go down to $12500, but I'm happy to meet you at $13000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll get great value out of the product. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $13000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one more attempt to meet in the middle. How about $12500? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",12500.0,Bob,6,
