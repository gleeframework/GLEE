"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900000 is closer, I'm still not able to go that low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers.  How about $950000? This would still give you a good deal, and it's a fair price for the value of the product.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $950000. I'm willing to pay $920000, which is a bit closer to your original offer. Can you consider this price?",920000.0,Bob,4,
