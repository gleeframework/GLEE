"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a strong starting point, leaving room for negotiation while ensuring I get a good price. If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide my next move based on his willingness to pay."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,550,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer and very close to my minimum acceptable price.

```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and I'm running out of time.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a guaranteed sale and I'm not confident I can get a better offer from Bob in the remaining rounds."
