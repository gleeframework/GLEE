,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950,000 is still a bit out of my budget. Given the value of the product to you, I'm willing to pay $850,000. I believe this price is fair, considering the potential benefits to both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which I believe is a fair price that reflects the potential value we both see in this product. Let's continue to work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,

I hope this proposal helps us move closer to closing this deal.",887500.0,Alice,5,
