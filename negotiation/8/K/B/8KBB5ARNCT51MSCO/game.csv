,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $90 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $75 for it.  Let me know what you think.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $75 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little bit. How about $85? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $85 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $80 for the product. That's a fair price for both of us, and it lets us close the deal.",80.0,Bob,4,
