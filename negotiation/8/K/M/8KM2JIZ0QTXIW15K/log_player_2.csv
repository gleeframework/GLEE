"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring you a lot of value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is less than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $13,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $13,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,500 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's lower than what he would pay John.  While he could potentially negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might walk away from the deal, forcing him to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures a good deal and minimizes the risk of losing the product entirely."
