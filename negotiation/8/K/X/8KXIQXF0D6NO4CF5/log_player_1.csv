Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $100. This gives me a potential profit of $20, which is better than selling it to John for $80.  

Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, this is a calculated risk. If he rejects the offer, I can still sell it to John for my minimum acceptable price."
