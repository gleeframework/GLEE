{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm offering it for $15,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, but still potentially appealing to Bob.  I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product.  If he's not, I'm prepared to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the suggestion, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would you be open to discussing a lower price for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still above my minimum acceptable price, and it seems like he's serious about buying the product.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation or selling to John for a lower price."
