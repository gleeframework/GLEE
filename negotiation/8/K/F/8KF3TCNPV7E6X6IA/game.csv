"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $8,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This still represents a great deal for you, as the product is worth $10,000 to you, and I am confident you'll be happy with the purchase.  Let's close this deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $10,500 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,000 and $10,500. How about $9,250?",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,250 is still below my minimum.  Let's split the difference again.  How about $9,875? That's a fair price for both of us, and allows you to get a great product at a reasonable cost.",9875.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting, but $9,875 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price?",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $9,500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet at $9,750.  This is a fair price for both of us, and ensures a smooth transaction.  What do you say?",9750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go above $9,500, and I think $9,750 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $9,750, which is $9,625. Can you consider that?",9625.0,Bob,8,
