"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I think $175 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you meet me halfway?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $150? That would be a fair price for both of us.",150.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $150 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay, but I'm still interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $130? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",130.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you're trying to find a middle ground, but $130 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $140, but that's my final offer. If you're not interested, I have another buyer waiting.",140.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to stick to your price, but I'm really close to walking away. I'm willing to meet you at $135, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to budge, I'll have to consider buying from John.",135.0,Bob,6,
