"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a good deal, Bob can potentially do better.  He has a ceiling of $1,200,000, so there's room to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  I'm interested, but I'm going to need to come in a bit lower than that. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best deal possible.  He's starting with a significant counteroffer, hoping to leverage the fact that Alice wants to sell the product and will likely be willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm glad you're willing to make an offer. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a great deal for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,050,000, which is within Bob's budget and a significant saving compared to buying from John. While Bob could potentially negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and then potentially going back to her original offer of $1,100,000  is too high. Accepting the offer at $1,050,000 is the safest and most financially beneficial choice for Bob at this point."
