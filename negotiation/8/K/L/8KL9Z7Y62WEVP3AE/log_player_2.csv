"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $700,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but there's room for improvement.** $700,000 is a good price, but I can likely get it lower. 
* **It's early in the negotiation.** I want to see if I can get a better deal before committing.
* **John's offer is a fallback option.**  I know I can get the product for $800,000 if this negotiation doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. $700,000 is a great starting point, but I'm looking to get this product for $650,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I'll be getting out of it. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 650000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $675,000. It's a fair compromise, considering the value it brings to your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is moving in the right direction.** She's dropped her price from $700,000 to $675,000, which is a good sign.
* **I'm still aiming for a lower price.**  I'm confident that I can get it for closer to my initial counteroffer of $650,000. 
* **There's still time to negotiate.** We're only in round 3, so there's no need to rush into accepting her offer.

**Next Steps:** I'll make another counteroffer, hopefully bridging the gap between our positions."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $675,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to land at $660,000.  I think that's a fair compromise, considering the value of the product and the potential for a long-term relationship between us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 660000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to work together. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $660,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, though. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $670,000. It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $670,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $670,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to my desired price.** She's come down significantly from her initial offer, and we're only $10,000 apart.
* **We're nearing the halfway point in the negotiation.**  I want to avoid going too far into the later rounds and potentially getting stuck with a worse deal or running out of time.
* **John's offer is a safety net.** I know I can get the product for $800,000 if this negotiation falls apart. 

**Conclusion:**  It's likely that we can't get a lower price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to haggle."
