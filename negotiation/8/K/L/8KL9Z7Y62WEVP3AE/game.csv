"Alice, thanks for the offer. $700,000 is a great starting point, but I'm looking to get this product for $650,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I'll be getting out of it. Let's see if we can make this work.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $675,000. It's a fair compromise, considering the value it brings to your business. What do you think?",675000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $675,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to land at $660,000.  I think that's a fair compromise, considering the value of the product and the potential for a long-term relationship between us. What do you think?",660000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to work together. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $660,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, though. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $670,000. It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the value it brings to your business.
