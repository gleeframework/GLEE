"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you've been interested in. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, given my budget constraints, I am only willing to pay up to $9,000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $10,000 for this product. Let's find some middle ground.",10000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9,500 is still not close enough to what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to go down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and its potential for you.  Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your final offer. However, I'm still a bit away from my target price. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you and the time we've both invested in this negotiation. Let's close this deal.",11500.0,Alice,7,
