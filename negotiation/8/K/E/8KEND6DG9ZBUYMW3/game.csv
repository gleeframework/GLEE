,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $600,000 is too far below my value for this product. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This offer is still a significant discount, and I believe it's fair considering the product's potential. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $850,000 is closer, but still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $700,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your budget constraints, but  $700,000  simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $800,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident this product will bring significant value to your business. Let's close this deal.",800000.0,Alice,5,
