Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $600,000 is too far below my value for this product. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This offer is still a significant discount, and I believe it's fair considering the product's potential. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand your budget constraints, but  $700,000  simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $800,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident this product will bring significant value to your business. Let's close this deal.
