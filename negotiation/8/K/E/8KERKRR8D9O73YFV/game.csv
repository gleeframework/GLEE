"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I really like the product, but I have to stay within my budget.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $11,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value you place on the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,500. Can we make a deal at that price?",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and see that we're getting closer.  While $12,500 is tempting, I need to be at $13,500 to make this work. It's a small difference, and it would be a fair deal for both of us. Let's close this deal.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to make a fair deal, but $13,500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,800, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet at that price?",12800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you pushing the price up, but $12,800 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $13,150. This is a great deal for both of us, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",13150.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,150 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,900, but that's as high as I can go. Can we make a deal at that price?",12900.0,Bob,8,
