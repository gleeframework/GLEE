Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?,900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $850000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875000.
