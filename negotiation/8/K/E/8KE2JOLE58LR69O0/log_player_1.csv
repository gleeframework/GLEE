Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a special price of $1,150,000. I believe it presents significant value at this price point, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($1,000,000) as possible without going below our minimum ($1,200,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, increasing our potential profit. 
* **Strong but Fair Offer:**  The message frames the offer as ""special"" and emphasizes value, making it more appealing to Bob.

**Important Note:** We have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000. This strengthens our position, allowing us to confidently aim higher with Bob."
