"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,000,000 is far beyond my budget for this product. I'm willing to offer $800,000, which is a fair price considering my value for the product. I'm open to discussing a compromise, but I won't go higher than that.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $2,000,000 represents my initial assessment, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price reflects the true potential and scarcity of what I'm offering. Let me know if this works for you.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,600,000 is still significantly higher than my budget.  I'm sticking with my initial offer of $800,000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm ready to finalize the deal. ",800000.0,Bob,4,
