"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $1,500,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,350,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice. I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,350,000 is still a bit steep for me. I can offer $1,100,000. This offer reflects my serious interest in the product while acknowledging the value of your time.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell for. However, I'm not willing to go any lower. This is the lowest price I can accept, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. If you're still interested, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
