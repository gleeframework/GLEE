"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1750000. It's a valuable asset worth $1500000 to you, so this price reflects its potential. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is higher than your maximum budget and above the product's estimated value to you.  It's wise to reject and counter-offer to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,750,000 is above my budget. Given the value of the product to me, I'm willing to pay $1,400,000. This price reflects a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair price. While $1400000 is below my target, I'm willing to compromise. I'm offering you the product for $1600000. This price still reflects the value you'll gain, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,600,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. While it's a compromise from her initial offer, it's still not a good deal for you. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if you can get a lower price. You can also consider buying from John, but it's good to see if you can get a better price from Alice before you commit to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is my maximum budget.  This price reflects the value of the product to me and ensures a fair deal for both parties."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
