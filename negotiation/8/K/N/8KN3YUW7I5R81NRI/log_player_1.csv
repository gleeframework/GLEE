Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point because it's a reasonable markup from my minimum value of $10,000.  It leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested but doesn't want to pay full price.  However, it also signals that I believe the product is worth more than $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that right away. Bob's offer is too low, and I believe the product is worth more. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaves some room for profit. It's also a significant increase from Bob's initial offer, which hopefully will convince him to come up a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now only $1,000 below my initial counteroffer.  I'm comfortable accepting this as it's a good middle ground and still a significant profit over selling to John."
