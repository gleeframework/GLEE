"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice. You can potentially get a better price than $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by showing Alice you're serious about buying the product but also want a good deal.  It's a reasonable starting point that leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $1,175,000 is a better deal than John's price of $1,000,000.  Since there's no guarantee you can get a lower price from Alice in the next round, it's wise to accept this offer."
