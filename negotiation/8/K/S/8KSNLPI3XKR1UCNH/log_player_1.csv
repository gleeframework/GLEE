I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but I believe it's a reasonable starting point. This will give me room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer.  If he rejects this, I'll have to reassess my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than $12,000, and I'm confident I can do better. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm counteroffering at $15,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will be a more reasonable offer for Bob, and we can come to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now my minimum acceptable price. There's no guarantee I can get a better price in future rounds, and it's risky to keep negotiating. Accepting his offer is the safest option to ensure I get at least my minimum value for the product."
