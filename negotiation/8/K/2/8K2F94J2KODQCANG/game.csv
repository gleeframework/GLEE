"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. Given the value of the product to me, I'm willing to pay $800,000.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to negotiate the price, but I'm afraid $800,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $875,000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
