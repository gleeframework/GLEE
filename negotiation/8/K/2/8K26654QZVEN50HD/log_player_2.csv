"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a special price of $13,000. I think you'll really love it, and I'm confident you'll get a lot of value out of it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is a good deal, it's still above Bob's desired price point.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down from your initial price. I'm really interested, but I'm looking to pay closer to $11,500. If you're willing to consider that, I'd be happy to move forward."", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,500. I think it's a fair price that balances our interests. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $12,500.** This is a better price than John's offer of $15,000.
* **Bob's goal is to save money.** Accepting Alice's offer means saving $2,500 compared to buying from John.
* **Negotiation is a balance:** While Bob might ideally get the product for $11,500, it's likely Alice won't budge further, making this a good compromise."
