"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I'm prepared to offer $16,000 for the product.  Let me know if that's something we can work with.",16000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value you place on it, $16,000 is a bit too low for me.  Would you consider $18,500?",18500.0,Alice,3,
