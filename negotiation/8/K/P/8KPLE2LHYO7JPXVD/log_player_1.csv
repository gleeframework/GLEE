Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $175. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you have a strong position to aim higher with Bob. Offering the product at $175 allows for a potential $25 profit margin. If Bob rejects the offer, you can still sell it to John at your minimum acceptable price."
