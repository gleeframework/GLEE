"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to offer $850,000. It's a fair price, considering your asking price and my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product has immense value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a stretch for my budget.  Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to offer $875,000,  which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I respect that.  Let's make this happen.  How about $887,500? It's a strong offer, and it allows me to acknowledge your willingness to negotiate.",887500.0,Alice,5,
