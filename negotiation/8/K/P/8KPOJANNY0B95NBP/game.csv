"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $800,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm willing to make a concession, but I believe this is a fair starting point. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer!  $800,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value to me.  Let's see if we can work something out.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your desire to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $750,000. This is a fair price considering the value to you, and I believe it's a great compromise. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,
