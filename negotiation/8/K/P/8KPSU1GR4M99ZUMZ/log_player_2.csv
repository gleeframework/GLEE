"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $100 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $125. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better for you than buying from John.** You can get the product for $125 from Alice, which is $25 less than what John is charging.
* **Even though you would prefer a lower price, accepting Alice's offer is the most rational choice.**  It saves you money compared to your alternative option."
