{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product I think you'd be interested in. It's valued at no less than $8,000 to me, but I'm willing to start negotiations at a price of $10,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its value to you, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to $8500. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still negotiate a higher price, especially since I have 8 rounds left."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $8,500 is still a bit below what I'm hoping to get for this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $9,250, as a good compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. Considering our previous discussions, I would like to propose a price of $9000. I believe this offers a fair compromise between our respective positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, $9,000 is a fair deal considering the time we've already spent negotiating and the fact that John will pay $8,000."
