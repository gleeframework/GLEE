{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is way above his budget. He should try to negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

Bob is offering $12,000, which is still below his maximum budget of $10,000 but significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows he's serious about buying the product but wants a fair price."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above his budget. He should continue negotiating with Alice to see if he can get closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

Bob is offering $13,500. This is a compromise - slightly higher than his previous offer but still below Alice's most recent price. He's trying to signal a willingness to negotiate but is not willing to go above his maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  Alice's price is still above his budget, and continuing to negotiate with her risks further delays and potential for Alice to make an even higher counteroffer.  It's better to secure the product at a price he's comfortable with from John."
