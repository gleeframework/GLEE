"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll appreciate its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This allows room for negotiation and gives me a strong starting position. I'm confident in the product's worth and want to see if I can get a better price than the guaranteed $120 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $110 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $125? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground by offering a price that's higher than Bob's last offer but lower than my initial offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a profitable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $115. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $115 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round. I'm willing to consider selling to John if I can't get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $115 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $120?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm making a final attempt to close the deal with Bob at my minimum acceptable price. This offer is fair and allows me to avoid selling to John for the same price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $118. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $118
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $118 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  At this point, I've had several rounds of negotiation and it's clear that Bob is unlikely to meet my price. I'm running out of time and don't want to risk losing the sale entirely.  It's time to sell to John and guarantee myself a profit."
