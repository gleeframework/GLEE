"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. I know it's worth $10,000 to you, but I'm confident you'll find it a great value. If you're interested, let me know and we can finalize the details. If not, I'll be selling it to someone else for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Even though Alice's offer is slightly better than John's, it still exceeds Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. Therefore, it's best to reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John."
