{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money from Bob as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  We know Bob values the product at $10,000.
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 with John.

By offering the product at $11,999, we are:

* **Significantly above Bob's Valuation:** Making a profit is likely.
* **Slightly below John's Offer:**  Creating a sense of urgency and a ""good deal"" for Bob. 

If Bob rejects this offer, we're not losing out, as we can sell to John at our desired price."
