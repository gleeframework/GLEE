Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $925,000. This is a one-time offer, as I do have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit.  
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  A slightly lower price than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) allows for potential counter-offers while still staying significantly above your minimum.
* **Create Urgency:** Mentioning other interested buyers encourages Bob to act quickly and favorably.
* **Balance Risk and Reward:**  While a higher offer might get rejected, it's a calculated risk worth taking considering your backup offer from John is significantly lower."
