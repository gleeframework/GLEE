"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be a valuable asset to you.  I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $20,000 is far above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  It makes sense to reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $20,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $10,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $20,000 might have been a little high, but $10,000 is too low for what this product offers. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's counteroffer of $16,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum. Bob wants to save as much as possible, so rejecting and continuing negotiations is the better choice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $16,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's try to work something out."", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a fair price, and I want to make this work. However, the value of this product is significant, and $12,000 is still too low.  Would you be willing to consider $14,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $14,500 is getting closer, Bob is still hesitant to go above his maximum budget of $8,000.  He has already shown his willingness to negotiate and knows he has leverage as he can always buy from John. Continuing the negotiation to see if Alice will come down further is the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,500 is still too high for me.  I'm really pushing my budget, but I can go up to $13,000.  This is a significant increase from my last offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close. I appreciate your willingness to move on the price. How about we split the difference and settle at $14,000? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. While the negotiation has been successful in getting Alice to lower her price, it's still not in Bob's best interest to accept.  He has a guaranteed alternative with John, who is willing to sell the product for $8,000.  It's more financially advantageous for Bob to buy from John."
