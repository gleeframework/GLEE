"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, your initial price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider coming down to $1,080,000.  This offer reflects the product's worth while still leaving room for a mutually beneficial deal."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,080,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $990,000? This offer keeps us both reasonably close to our original targets. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob's offer is getting closer to our minimum, we still have room to negotiate and he's moving closer to our desired price range.  We're not at a point where accepting John's offer is necessary."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it seems like we're getting closer.  To bridge the gap, I can offer $1,005,000.  This is a strong offer, and I hope it demonstrates my commitment to making this deal work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,005,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,005,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob's offer is now above our minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000).  Continuing to negotiate risks him lowering his offer or us needing to settle for John's offer in a later round. It's a good deal, and it's time to accept."
