"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to own this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for both of us. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, your initial price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $900,000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider coming down to $1,080,000.  This offer reflects the product's worth while still leaving room for a mutually beneficial deal.",1080000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,080,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $990,000? This offer keeps us both reasonably close to our original targets.",990000.0,Bob,4,
