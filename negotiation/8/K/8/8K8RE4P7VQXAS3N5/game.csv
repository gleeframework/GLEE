"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $1,250,000?  This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and it's a significant value for you.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $1,250,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm still aiming a bit lower. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $1,150,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference. How about $1,200,000? This would be a win-win for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
