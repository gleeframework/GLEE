"I have a unique and valuable product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $8,000, and I'm willing to negotiate further if you're interested.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the information about the product. However, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $5,000.  Let me know what you think.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $5,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,000. This is a compromise that should be reasonable for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle, Alice. While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for me.  Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting closer, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $6,500. I'm willing to meet you at $8,000, which is still below my minimum price but closer to what I'm looking for. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here.",8000.0,Alice,5,
