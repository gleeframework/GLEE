"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a good starting point and allows for potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $85?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $85 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. I want to see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $85 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $92.50? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 92.5} 
```

I'm offering a counteroffer at $92.50, which is the midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still maintaining a price point that's closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $92.50 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Let's try $88.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While $88 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'll continue negotiating to see if I can reach a better agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $88 is still a little too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle again.  How about $90? This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer at $90, which is the midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while staying closer to my target price."
