"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a valuable piece, and I believe this price reflects its worth while also giving you a good deal. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000, and I'm willing to make a reasonable profit. Let's meet in the middle.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we meet at $1,100,000?  This gives you a good price, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. ",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,100,000. How about we try $1,050,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a reasonable profit.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your compromise, but $1,050,000 still doesn't quite work for me. I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle, though. How about we settle at $1,150,000? This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement that's mutually beneficial. Let's make this happen!",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. Let's see if we can make a deal at this price.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,075,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to make one final compromise.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,125,000. This is the absolute lowest I can go, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.  I truly believe in the value of this product, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement before I need to look elsewhere.",1125000.0,Alice,7,
