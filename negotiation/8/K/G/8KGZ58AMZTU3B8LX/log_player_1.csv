"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a valuable piece, and I believe this price reflects its worth while also giving you a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product while also highlighting the potential for a good deal. 
* **Room for Compromise:** This price leaves room for several counteroffers before reaching my minimum acceptable price. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize my profit. By starting high, I hope to secure a price closer to my desired $1,500,000. However, I'm willing to negotiate and use John's offer as a fallback option if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000, and I'm willing to make a reasonable profit. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** While Bob's offer is low, there's still room for negotiation. He's acknowledged the product's value to me, indicating he's open to a higher price.
* **Risk of Selling to John:** Selling to John now would guarantee $1,500,000, but I might be able to get closer to that price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. I'll make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price point.  I'm confident that I can get a better price than $900,000 while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we meet at $1,100,000?  This gives you a good price, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. "", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing I'm open to negotiation.
* **Balancing Value:**  $1,100,000 is significantly higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my initial offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to me, hoping to persuade him to move closer to my price. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to move the negotiation closer to my desired price point while keeping the deal alive. By offering $1,100,000, I'm testing the waters to see if Bob is willing to move closer to my value. If he rejects this offer, I can still consider selling to John or make another counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,100,000. How about we try $1,050,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a reasonable profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Below My Minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation, especially considering Bob is willing to meet me halfway.
* **Risk of Selling to John:** Selling to John now would secure my desired price, but I'm still confident I can get a better deal with Bob.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer. I'll aim to stay above my minimum acceptable price while still showing flexibility. I'm confident that I can reach a mutually agreeable price without jeopardizing my profits."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your compromise, but $1,050,000 still doesn't quite work for me. I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle, though. How about we settle at $1,150,000? This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement that's mutually beneficial. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer, but making a counter-offer that is closer to his last offer to demonstrate my willingness to compromise.
* **Reaching Middle Ground:** $1,150,000 is exactly halfway between Bob's last offer ($1,050,000) and my previous offer ($1,200,000). This shows a commitment to finding a middle ground.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiations amicable and increase the likelihood of Bob accepting.

**Strategy:**

By offering $1,150,000, I'm trying to push Bob closer to my desired price point while still remaining open to negotiation. I believe this offer is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will see the value in accepting it. However, if Bob continues to reject my offers, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John to secure my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. Let's see if we can make a deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer, while closer, is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Limited Negotiation Room:**  We're getting close to a deal, but there's still a gap. I'm not convinced I can push Bob much higher, but I'm not ready to give up yet.
* **Risk of Selling to John:** While John's offer is tempting, I still believe I can get closer to my desired price with Bob. 

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and make one final counteroffer. I'll aim for a price that's close to my minimum but leaves room for a slight compromise from Bob. If he rejects this final offer, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,075,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to make one final compromise.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,125,000. This is the absolute lowest I can go, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.  I truly believe in the value of this product, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement before I need to look elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This is my final offer, emphasizing that I'm reaching my limit.
* **Splitting the Difference:** By splitting the difference with Bob's offer, it demonstrates a willingness to meet halfway and find a solution.
* **Urgency and Value:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product and the possibility of needing to explore other options, creating a sense of urgency for Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

This counter-offer is a calculated risk. It's close to my minimum acceptable price but still leaves room for Bob to make a small concession. If he rejects, I will sell to John. I'm hoping the urgency and the compromise I've shown will convince Bob to accept this final offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're making a final compromise, but $1,125,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,075,000 and $1,125,000. How about we try $1,100,000? This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. Let's see if we can make a deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Below Minimum:** $1,100,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Limited Time:** We're down to the last few rounds, and it's unlikely Bob will budge much further.
* **Guaranteeing My Minimum:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and eliminates the risk of further negotiation that could lead to a lower price. 

**Strategy:**

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, it's becoming clear that Bob won't go higher. I'm choosing to sell to John to ensure I get my minimum and secure a deal before the negotiation window closes."
