"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something that I'm confident can help your business reach new heights. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000, which is a significant discount from its true market value. This is a limited-time offer, as I have another interested buyer ready to purchase it for $800,000. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
