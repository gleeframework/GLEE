Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $1500000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it, given its quality and potential value. I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects both of our interests.  Let's see if we can work this out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
