"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high, at $20,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters. I want to see if he's truly interested and willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $12,000 is far too low, and I'm confident I can get more.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $18,000. It's still above my minimum, and I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not giving up my profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $14,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get more. I'll counter again in the next round to see if I can bridge the gap. I'm not yet ready to settle for John's offer, as I want to maximize my profit if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm now offering $16,000. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, but it's still above my minimum and leaves some room for further negotiation. With only 5 rounds left, I'm aiming to close the deal with Bob if possible, but I'm also keeping John's offer as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $13,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a little more. We have four rounds left, and I want to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. If not, I'll be happy to sell to John for $15,000, but I'm not giving up on maximizing my profit just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm making a final counteroffer of $14,500. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer and just above my minimum. I'm hoping that this is enough to convince Bob to close the deal. If not, I'll sell to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, I'm going to sell to John.  It's not my ideal price, but it's above my minimum, and I don't want to risk Bob continuing to lowball me."
