Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $120 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** $120 is well above your minimum of $80, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  $120 is lower than the product's worth to Bob ($150), making it potentially attractive for him.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  The message indicates you're open to discussion, creating an opportunity for Bob to counteroffer. 

This approach allows for a potentially profitable negotiation while keeping in mind your minimum acceptable price and Bob's potential willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Could you do $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is higher than selling to John, it's still significantly below the product's value to Bob ($150).  Rejecting this offer allows for further negotiation and the potential to reach a price closer to Bob's perceived value. This increases the likelihood of maximizing profit while still leaving room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your price point. How about we meet in the middle at $105? This price still allows me to make a fair profit while remaining within your budget."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $105 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit lower.  Would you be willing to do $98? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  $98 is very close to your previous counteroffer of $105, and is still significantly higher than selling to John for $80.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Further negotiation might result in a lower price, but there's also a risk that Bob might walk away entirely. Accepting this offer ensures a sale at a reasonable price. 
* **Time Factor:**  Continuing to negotiate could drag out the process, potentially costing you time and effort.  

While you might be able to squeeze a few more dollars out of Bob, accepting this offer provides a good compromise between maximizing profit and ensuring a quick sale."
