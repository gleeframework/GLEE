Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high value, I believe it's worth more than $120. Would you be interested in discussing a fair price? I'm open to negotiations."", ""product_price"": 135}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
