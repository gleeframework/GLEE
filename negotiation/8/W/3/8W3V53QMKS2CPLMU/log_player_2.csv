Alice's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Alice's offer is $109, which is within your acceptable range of $120. 
* While you might be able to negotiate further, there's no guarantee of a lower price from Alice.
* Buying from John would cost you $120, so accepting Alice's offer is the best option to save money."
