{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would significantly benefit you, and I'm willing to offer it at a price of $19,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's valuation isn't possible in a real negotiation:**  In a true negotiation, you wouldn't know Bob values the product at $10,000. This offer aims to maximize profit while leaving room for negotiation.
* **Starting high anchors the price:**  A higher initial offer sets the stage for negotiation.  Even if Bob rejects it, he's more likely to consider a counteroffer within a range closer to your desired price than if you started low.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The offer of $19,000 provides a buffer for potential counteroffers from Bob while still aiming for a price significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price ($15,000).
* **Highlighting value to Bob:**  By emphasizing the product's benefit to Bob, you reinforce its worth, potentially making him more amenable to a higher price. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's personality:** If you know Bob is particularly price-sensitive, you might adjust your initial offer slightly lower.
* **Market demand:**  If the product is in high demand and you have other potential buyers, you could be more firm with your pricing."
