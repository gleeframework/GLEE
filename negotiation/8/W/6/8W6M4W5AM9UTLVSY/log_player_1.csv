Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point.  It's above my minimum price of $100, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter. It's also lower than the product's value to Bob, making it more likely he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is more than John's offer, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to make a compromise."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet in the middle at $102.50? I'm willing to pay $102.50 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $102.50 is still less than my ideal price, it's more than what John is offering and close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to accept this offer to secure a sale and avoid further negotiation."
