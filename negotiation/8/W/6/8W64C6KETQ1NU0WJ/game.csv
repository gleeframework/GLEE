"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $850000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $600000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850000 might be a stretch, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600000. Let me see if I can meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $750000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly unique.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $750000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $700000, which I think is a fair price considering the value we've both discussed. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $725000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly unique.",725000.0,Alice,5,
