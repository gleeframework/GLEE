Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe is of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. This is a great price considering the value it holds. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000 is a starting point for negotiation.** It's above Bob's perceived value but below your minimum threshold. 
* **The message is friendly and positive.**  This encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation and potentially offer a counter-offer.

**Important Note:** This is just the first offer.  It's crucial to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response and the progress of the negotiation.  If Bob rejects your offer, be prepared to either counter-offer again or, if his counter-offer is too low, move on to John and sell the product for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my expenses lower. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $9000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$9,000 is still below your minimum threshold of $15,000.** Accepting this offer would result in a significant loss.
* **Rejecting allows you to counteroffer.** You can aim for a price closer to your minimum threshold.

**Next Steps:**

*  **Counteroffer with a price closer to your minimum.** You can start with something like $11,000 and see how Bob responds.
* **Be prepared to negotiate.**  You may need to make concessions to reach a price that works for both of you. 
* **Always keep John's $15,000 offer in mind.** This is your fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, though.  How about $11,000? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's see if we can find a compromise here."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **$11,000 is a compromise:** It's lower than your initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer. 
* **The message is still friendly and positive:** This encourages Bob to continue negotiating.
* **The message emphasizes the value:**  It reminds Bob of the product's worth to make a counteroffer more appealing.

**Next Steps:**

* **Be prepared for Bob to counteroffer again.** It's likely he won't accept $11,000 immediately.
* **Adjust your strategy based on his response:** If Bob counteroffers at a price you find acceptable, you can accept. If not, you can counteroffer again or consider selling to John. 
* **Remember, you are in control of the negotiation.**  You can always choose to stop negotiating with Bob and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, could we meet somewhere in the middle at $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000 is a reasonable compromise:** It's closer to your minimum threshold of $15,000 and a significant increase from Bob's previous offer. 
* **Accepting the offer secures a sale:**  While you might be able to get a slightly higher price, there's a risk that further negotiation could lead to a breakdown. 

**Considerations:**

* **Time:** Continuing to negotiate could take more time, especially if you want to reach a higher price.
* **Risk:** There's a chance that Bob might become unwilling to negotiate further if you reject his offer.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  The longer you spend negotiating with Bob, the longer you delay selling the product and receiving payment.

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Bob's offer at $10,000 is the most practical decision at this point. It allows you to secure a sale at a price that is significantly higher than Bob's initial offer and within a reasonable range of your desired price."
