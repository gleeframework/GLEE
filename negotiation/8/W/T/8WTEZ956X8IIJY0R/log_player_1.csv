Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters, but it's still a fair starting point considering the product is worth at least $100 to me. I'm confident that if Bob rejects this offer, I can still get a good price from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $140 is better than $100 from John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
```

I'm offering $145. This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate but still holding firm on my desire for a price closer to my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $142
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would ideally like a bit more,  $142 is a good price, especially compared to the $100 I'd get from John. There's always a risk that Bob could continue to haggle down further, and it's not worth risking losing a sale altogether."
