Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to come down, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like the spirit of compromise, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,500 yet. I'm willing to come down to $10,250, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's close to his budget, he can still try to get a better price.  He has already been able to bring Alice down significantly and with more negotiation, he may be able to get the product for his desired $10,000."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm still not quite there. Let's try $10,100. This would be a fair compromise, and would allow us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 10100}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell the product for. This is a fair price, considering the value it brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He's reached his goal of getting the product for $10,000, and there's no need to risk further negotiation.  If he rejects the offer, he might be able to get a lower price, but he also risks Alice changing her mind or the deal falling apart."
