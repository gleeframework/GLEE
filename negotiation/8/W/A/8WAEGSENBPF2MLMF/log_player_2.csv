"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is a good deal, it's still above the product's value to you. You have room to negotiate and try to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation. It also demonstrates your willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price."
