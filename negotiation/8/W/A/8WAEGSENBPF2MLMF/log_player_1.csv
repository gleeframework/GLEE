Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a good starting point as it's a significant amount more than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially get closer to the $12,000 value it holds for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer of $9,000 is still significantly more than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $10,000, accepting his offer is a good decision considering there is a chance he could reject my counteroffer and I'd be left with only John's offer of $8,000."
