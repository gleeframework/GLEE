# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go below $145. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $145 is still above my budget.  We've been negotiating for a while, and it seems unlikely that we'll reach an agreement within my price range.  I'm going to take advantage of John's offer, which is within my budget and guarantees me the product."
