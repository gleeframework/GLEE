"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its unique features and benefits, I'm offering it to you at a starting price of $22,000. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000 for a product like this. What's the best you can do?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. This product offers unique advantages and I'm confident it will bring you a lot of value.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the product has value, but $18,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  Could you do $11,000?  That's a reasonable compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me to find a fair price. While $11,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant discount. Let's settle this right now - how about $15,000 even? This ensures I get a fair deal, and you get a valuable product at a great price.",15000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer. I can tell this product means a lot to you, and I respect that.  To make this work for me, I can go up to $12,000. Let me know if that works for you.",12000.0,Bob,6,
