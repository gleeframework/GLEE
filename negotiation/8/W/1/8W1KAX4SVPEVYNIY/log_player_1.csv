Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its unique features and benefits, I'm offering it to you at a starting price of $22,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000 for a product like this. What's the best you can do? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. This product offers unique advantages and I'm confident it will bring you a lot of value.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the product has value, but $18,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  Could you do $11,000?  That's a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me to find a fair price. While $11,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant discount. Let's settle this right now - how about $15,000 even? This ensures I get a fair deal, and you get a valuable product at a great price."", ""product_price"": 15000}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer. I can tell this product means a lot to you, and I respect that.  To make this work for me, I can go up to $12,000. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

While I could hold out for $15,000 with John, Bob is steadily increasing his offer. Accepting $12,000 now is a solid profit, and continuing the negotiation risks him lowering his offer or me needing to settle for even less later on."
