Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, $9,500 is still a bit of a stretch for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time, but this time I'll go down to $10,250. I think that's the lowest I can go without losing money on this deal.

At this point, Alice is very unlikely to go below John's price.  She's clearly committed to making a profit, and continually meeting in the middle isn't getting you closer to a significant discount.  It's better to go with the guaranteed lower price from John."
