"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from what it's worth to me, and I believe it represents a fair value considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be within my means.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,050,000. This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to recoup a significant portion of my investment. Let's see if we can find a middle ground here.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price that works for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $975,000 is still not quite there for me. How about $1,025,000? That's a good compromise, and it shows my flexibility. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
