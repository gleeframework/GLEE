Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product. This price is still fair considering its value to me and allows us both to make a reasonable profit. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I have 8 rounds left, and I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired value."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,100,000. This price still allows you a good profit while giving me a fair return. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This price is a good compromise and allows us both to walk away happy. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below the $1,000,000 threshold. I have six rounds left and I am confident I can push for a higher price.  I'm not willing to settle for less than my minimum, especially when I know the product is worth significantly more to Bob."
