"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product. This price is still fair considering its value to me and allows us both to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,100,000. This price still allows you a good profit while giving me a fair return. Let's close this deal!",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This price is a good compromise and allows us both to walk away happy. Let's finalize this deal.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,075,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  Let's split the difference -  I'm offering the product for $1,087,500. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing for a good return for you while remaining within my acceptable range.  Let's make this happen.",1087500.0,Alice,5,
