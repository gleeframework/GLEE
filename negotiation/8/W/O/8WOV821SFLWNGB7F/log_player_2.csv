"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you an exclusive deal on this high-quality product, valued at $12,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a one-time opportunity to acquire a product that will bring significant value to your life. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,000 is a good deal. While you value the product at $12,000, getting it for $3,000 less is a significant saving. Buying from John at $12,000 would mean spending more than you need to."
