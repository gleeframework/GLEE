"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe it's a great price, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. Can you meet me at this price?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not quite comfortable meeting you at $750000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $850000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your business.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still think $750000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $775000. Can you consider this offer?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to meet you at $775000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of $825000. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you need to make a profit, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $825000. I'm willing to meet you at $795000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping you can meet me at this price.",795000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you've made a final offer, Bob, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can meet you at $810000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal for you, and I believe it's worth considering. What do you say?",810000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I've made it clear that I'm not willing to pay more than $800000. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if we can't meet at this price. I'd like to make a final offer of $800000. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll consider purchasing the product from John for the same price.",800000.0,Bob,8,
