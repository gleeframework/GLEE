"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $13,000 to start negotiations. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $8,500 at this time. This is my absolute maximum. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $8,500 is too low, I'm willing to be flexible to make a deal. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a worthwhile investment at that price."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $11,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there. I can offer $9,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and the fact that I'm a serious buyer.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to budge much higher than $9,500. While we could counter, it's getting risky, and we have a guaranteed offer of $10,000 from John. Taking the guaranteed profit is the best course of action."
