Round 2

```

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $8,500 is too low, I'm willing to be flexible to make a deal. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a worthwhile investment at that price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $11,000 is still above my maximum budget of $8,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a price that works for both of us."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $11,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there. I can offer $9,500.
