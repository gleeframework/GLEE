"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $13,000 to start negotiations. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $8,500 at this time. This is my absolute maximum.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $8,500 is too low, I'm willing to be flexible to make a deal. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a worthwhile investment at that price.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $11,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there. I can offer $9,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and the fact that I'm a serious buyer.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",9500.0,Bob,4,
