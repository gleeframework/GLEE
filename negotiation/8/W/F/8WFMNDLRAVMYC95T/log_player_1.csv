{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're still making a profit of $2,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob has incentive to counteroffer, and you can adjust your price depending on his response.
* **It's a fair price:**  While Bob is willing to pay more, this offer gives him a good deal and leaves a good margin for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $13500 for it. I hope this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still worth trying to get a bit more. You can likely get closer to your desired price by counter-offering. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you keep the negotiation going and have a chance to secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get closer to my asking price.  How about $13,750? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows us to both walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I am willing to increase my offer to $13600 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

At this point, Bob's offer is very close to your desired price point, and you're making a profit of $1,600. Continuing to negotiate might only yield a small increase, and it risks losing the deal altogether. 

Accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible option, as it secures a good price and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
