Bob is still significantly undervaluing the product. While his offer is getting closer to a million, I'm willing to play hardball a bit longer to try and secure a better price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

While I could push for more, accepting $1,060,000 ensures I make a significant profit and don't risk losing Bob as a buyer."
