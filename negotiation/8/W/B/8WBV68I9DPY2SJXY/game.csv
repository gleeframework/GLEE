"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation with an offer of $900,000. This is a great value considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to discussing further, but I think this is a fair starting point. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $700,000. I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. However, I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. Considering the value it brings to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  To be totally transparent, I have a hard limit at $750,000. If you're willing to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today. Otherwise, I might have to explore other options.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your hard limit of $750,000, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $800,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's worth to you. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
