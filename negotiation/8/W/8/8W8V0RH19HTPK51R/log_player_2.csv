Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $200 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $175? I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $130. How about we compromise at $155? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $155.  It's better to secure the product from John at $150 and avoid further back and forth."
