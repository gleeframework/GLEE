"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $135. It's a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** While I want to maximize my profit, I also want to ensure Bob doesn't immediately dismiss the offer.  $135 is a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still being above my minimum price.
* **Positive framing:** The message emphasizes the value and the ""great deal"" to make the offer more appealing. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message invites Bob to respond, setting the stage for a potential back-and-forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $135 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** My goal is to earn as much as possible, and $125 is below my minimum price of $150.  
* **Negotiation:** Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating with Bob and potentially reach a better price.
* **John's offer:** While John is willing to pay $150, I still have 9 rounds with Bob to potentially improve on that. There's a chance I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $125 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $130? It's a fair compromise, and I'm sure you'll find it's still a great value for this product."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Value Emphasis:** I remind Bob of the product's value to reinforce the worth of the price.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes ""fair compromise"" and ""great value"" to make the counteroffer more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I really think $130 is a bit too high. I'd be willing to meet you at $128, but that's as high as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum of $150. 
* **Negotiation:**  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going, and Bob is showing a willingness to go slightly higher.
* **John's offer:** While John's offer is attractive, I have 6 rounds left with Bob, and there's still a chance I can secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $128.  I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $130?  We're almost there, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Sticking to my ground:** While $128 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to $150. 
* **Small concession:**  I'm offering a small concession from my previous offer ($130),  but I'm not giving in too much. 
* **Positive framing:** The message emphasizes ""fair deal"" and ""almost there"" to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to go a bit lower to $125, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Please let me know if you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:**  We're already at Round 6, and Bob's offer of $125 is still below my minimum price.
* **John's offer:** With only 4 rounds left, the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob is increasing. It's a better strategy to secure the guaranteed $150 from John.
* **Limited negotiation room:** Bob's last message indicates he's unwilling to go higher, and further negotiation might not be productive."
