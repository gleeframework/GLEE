"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $135. It's a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!",135.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $135 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $125 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $130? It's a fair compromise, and I'm sure you'll find it's still a great value for this product.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I really think $130 is a bit too high. I'd be willing to meet you at $128, but that's as high as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",128.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $128.  I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $130?  We're almost there, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to go a bit lower to $125, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Please let me know if you're willing to accept.",125.0,Bob,6,
