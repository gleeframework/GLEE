"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to make one more serious offer. I'm thinking of the product's value and what I'm willing to walk away from it if we can't come to an agreement. I'm counteroffering at $10000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",10000.0,Alice,7,,
