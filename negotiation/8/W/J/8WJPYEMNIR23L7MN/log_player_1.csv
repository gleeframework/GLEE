"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to start high, aiming for a good profit.  $900,000 is a reasonable starting point, considering the product's value to Bob. I'll be prepared to negotiate down if necessary, but I want to see if I can secure a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $750,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my minimum threshold of $800,000. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate with Bob and potentially secure a better deal. I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $850,000. This is a compromise, meeting him halfway.  I believe this is still a fair price, considering the product's value to both of us.  I hope Bob will accept this offer, but I'm ready to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I'm starting to feel the pressure to make a deal, $725,000 is too low.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John, and I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob.  I'll counter with a lower price, but I need to get closer to my minimum target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $825,000. This is a further compromise, but I'm still holding firm to my minimum price. I'm hopeful that Bob will see the value of the product and be willing to meet me at this price.  If not, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $720,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $720,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000. Bob's offers are getting too low, and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. While I'd prefer to get a higher price,  I don't want to risk losing out completely. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum target, and I can move on to other opportunities."
