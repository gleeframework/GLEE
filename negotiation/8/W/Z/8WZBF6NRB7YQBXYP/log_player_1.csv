"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Could you consider $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial ask, but still considerably more than my minimum selling price. I see an opportunity to negotiate further.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That being said, $1,150,000 is still a bit steep. Would you be willing to do $1,075,000? I think that's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","While Bob hasn't met my desired price, his offer is getting closer to a point where I'd accept. It's a good profit margin, and continued haggling might not yield much more.
