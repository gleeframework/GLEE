Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a good starting point because it's higher than Bob's valuation but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers and also shows I'm willing to be flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I will reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $100. This is still above Bob's offer but lower than my previous offer, showing a willingness to compromise. Hopefully, this will entice Bob to accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. It's clear that we're not going to reach a mutually agreeable price.  Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $120. This ensures I meet my minimum price and avoid further negotiation."
