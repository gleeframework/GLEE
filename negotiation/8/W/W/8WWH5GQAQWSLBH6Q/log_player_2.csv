"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a good deal compared to John's price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested but $9,500 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $9,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a great price for a product worth $10,000 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:**  The product is worth $10,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is $9,250. This is a significant saving.
* **Progress:**  Alice has already lowered her price from $9,500. Further negotiation might be possible, but it's not guaranteed.
* **Risk:**  There are only 7 rounds remaining.  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate or Alice walking away, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price.

Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product for a lower price than John and minimizes the risk of a failed negotiation."
