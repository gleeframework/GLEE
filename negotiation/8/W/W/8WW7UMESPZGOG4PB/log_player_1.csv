Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its worth to you. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible, without pushing him away.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it allows some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, leading to a potentially even higher final price.
* **Backup Option:**  We have John as a reliable backup buyer at $800,000, ensuring we won't be left empty-handed if Bob declines.

By starting high but not unreasonable, we increase our chances of securing a deal that benefits us the most."
