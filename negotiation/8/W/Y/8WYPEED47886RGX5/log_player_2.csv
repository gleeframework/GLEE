"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $115 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. While $115 is less than his maximum of $120, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested but $115 is a bit steep for me.  How about $105?  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  $105 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $110, which is within Bob's budget of $120.  This is a good deal for Bob as he saves $10 compared to buying from John. While further negotiation is possible, the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer and the potential for a longer negotiation process makes accepting the offer the most practical choice."
