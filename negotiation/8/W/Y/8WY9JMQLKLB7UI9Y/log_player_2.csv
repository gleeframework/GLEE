"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your business, even more so than my initial asking price. To kick things off, I'd like to offer it to you for $2,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering. That said, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000? This recognizes the value it brings while still offering a potential for a strong return on your investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price. However, $1,700,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Would you consider $1,100,000?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems like we're at an impasse. While I'm open to negotiation, your current offer doesn't reflect the product's true worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000, but that's my final offer.  This is a minimal concession and ensures I'm not undervaluing this asset. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is holding firm at a price significantly above your limit and has labeled it as her ""final offer.""  While she might be bluffing, it's too risky to continue. You have a guaranteed option with John at $1,200,000, which is within your budget and saves you a significant amount compared to Alice's offer."
