"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your business, even more so than my initial asking price. To kick things off, I'd like to offer it to you for $2,000,000.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. That said, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000? This recognizes the value it brings while still offering a potential for a strong return on your investment.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price. However, $1,700,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems like we're at an impasse. While I'm open to negotiation, your current offer doesn't reflect the product's true worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000, but that's my final offer.  This is a minimal concession and ensures I'm not undervaluing this asset.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
