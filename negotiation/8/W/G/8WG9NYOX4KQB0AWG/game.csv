"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I think that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think you'll find it's a great deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to find a little more wiggle room in the budget.  Would you be open to a price closer to $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I can offer you a compromise at $1,075,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations so far.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,075,000 is getting close, but I think we can still find a number that works for both of us. How about we settle on $1,060,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1060000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $1,065,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations so far.",1065000.0,Alice,7,
