Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I'm initially setting the price at $2,000,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course."", ""product_price"": 2000000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest level. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message emphasizes openness to discussion, signaling that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Alternative Option:** I have John as a backup, ensuring I don't have to settle for less than $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I'm willing to pay that much for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Value:** Bob's offer is $400,000 above his perceived value, indicating room for negotiation.
* **Below My Minimum:** Accepting would mean selling for less than John's offer. 
* **Strategic Counter:** Rejecting allows me to counter with a price closer to my target while still exceeding Bob's perceived value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest. While I'm eager to find a deal that works for both of us, $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Would you be willing to meet me at $1,800,000?"", ""product_price"": 1800000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** I'm coming down from my initial price, demonstrating willingness to negotiate but not drastically.
* **Targeting Above Bob's Offer:** The counteroffer remains significantly above Bob's initial bid, pushing for a higher settlement. 
* **Still Above My Minimum:** The price remains comfortably above both my minimum and John's offer, maintaining a strong position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to your price, but I still think $1,800,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,700,000. Can we agree on that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $1,700,000 is a substantial profit, exceeding both my minimum and John's offer.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has consistently increased his offer, indicating a strong desire for the product. 
* **Risk of Pushing Further:**  While I might be able to get a bit more, there's a risk that Bob might walk away if I push too hard. It's better to secure a great deal now."
