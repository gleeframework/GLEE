"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at this price?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850000, which is a significant reduction from my original offer.  This price reflects your interest in the product, while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit. Let's find common ground here.  What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down from your original price, but $850000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $825000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",825000.0,Bob,4,
