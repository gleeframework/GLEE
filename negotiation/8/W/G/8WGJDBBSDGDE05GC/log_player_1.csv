Bob's offer:

I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.

While I'd prefer to sell to John for $1,000,000, Bob's offer of $825,000 is close enough to my minimum acceptable price that it's worth accepting. Continuing to negotiate could risk losing Bob and ending up with nothing."
