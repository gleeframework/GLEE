"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but  $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. Could we settle around $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,1000000.0
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,975000.0
"I understand that $925,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. I'll meet you at $975,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",975000.0,Alice,5,,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $950,000, Bob. I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm still not quite there. I'll meet you at $985,000, which is just $15,000 above your last offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",985000.0,Alice,7,,
