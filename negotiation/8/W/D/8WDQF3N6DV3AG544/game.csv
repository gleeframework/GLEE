"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my own valuation and the opportunity for both of us to make a deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the price of $850,000 is significantly below its true value and my bottom line.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is still beyond what I can realistically afford.  I'm willing to offer $900,000, which is a significant compromise for me, and I believe a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let's try to find a middle ground here.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the gap between our valuations remains substantial.  My final offer is $950,000. I believe this is a very fair compromise that reflects the true value of this product. If this doesn't work, I'm afraid we'll have to explore other options.",950000.0,Alice,5,
