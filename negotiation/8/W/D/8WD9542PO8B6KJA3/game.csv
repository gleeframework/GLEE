"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $5,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price. Let's see if we can make this work.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $9,000 is closer, but still a little high for me. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $7,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
