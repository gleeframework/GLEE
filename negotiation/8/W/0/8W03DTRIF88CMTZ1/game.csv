"Hi Alice, $18000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $14000 at this time. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While I'm willing to be flexible, $14000 is a bit too low for me. I'm open to a compromise, how about $16000? That leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $16000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle at $15000. This would be a fair price for both of us.",15000.0,Bob,4,
