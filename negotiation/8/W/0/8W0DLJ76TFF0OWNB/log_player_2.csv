# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is still a bit below my target price. However, I'm willing to make another concession.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're in the 9th round, and Alice's final offer of $1,015,000 is still above my budget.  While we've been making progress, I'm concerned that we might not be able to reach an agreement in the final round. It's better to secure the product from John for $800,000 rather than risk getting stuck with a price I'm not comfortable with."
