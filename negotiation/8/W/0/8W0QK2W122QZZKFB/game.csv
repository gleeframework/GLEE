"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to my maximum willingness to pay. How about $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. However,  $750,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes its value while acknowledging your budget.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $875,000 is still quite a distance from what I'm willing to accept. Let's try to close this gap quickly. I'm proposing $900,000.  This offer reflects the product's worth while recognizing your desire for a fair deal.",900000.0,Alice,5,
