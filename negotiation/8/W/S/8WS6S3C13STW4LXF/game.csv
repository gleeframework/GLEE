"Alice,  $20000 is way above my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only offer $8000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a deal at $18000. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to own something unique. Let me know what you think.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $18000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10000.  This is my best offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you a deal at $16000. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to own something unique. Let me know what you think.",16000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $16000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $12000.  This is my final offer.",12000.0,Bob,6,

"Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility, but $14000 is still too high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $13000. This is my final offer.  I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $13000. I can offer you a deal at $14500. It's a bit higher than my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know what you think.",14500.0,Alice,9,
