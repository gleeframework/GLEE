"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to offer it to you for $11,000.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  How about we settle at $10,000? That's my final offer.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'd like to offer it to you for $11,200. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",11200.0,Alice,5,
