"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good price, it's still above the product's value to Alice ($8,000). There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's offer, but it's still a fair price considering the product's value to Alice and Bob's budget.  By offering $10,000, Bob is showing he is serious about buying the product while still trying to save money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11000, which is still a great price for you considering the product's value. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a good price, Bob can still try to negotiate further.  His goal is to save as much money as possible.  By rejecting the offer, he can try to get a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about $10,500? It's a fair price for both of us and closer to what I can afford."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his goal of saving as much money as possible.  This counteroffer is a small compromise from his previous offer but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit while staying within Bob's budget."
