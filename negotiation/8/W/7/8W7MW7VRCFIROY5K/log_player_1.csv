Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this valuable product.  I believe its worth is easily above a million, but to kick off our negotiation, I'm willing to let it go for $1,000,000. What do you think?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 to start the negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is my final offer for today.  I'm confident it's a fair price that reflects the product's worth."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $900,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  I could do $700,000. I think that's a fair offer considering its true value and allows us both to benefit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is moving closer to my price range, he's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. It's unlikely he'll reach that number in the remaining rounds. Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
