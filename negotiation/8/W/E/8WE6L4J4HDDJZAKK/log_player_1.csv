"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring a profit for me.
* **Friendly Approach:** A friendly message helps build rapport and makes Bob more likely to engage.
* **Highlighting Value:**  The message mentions the product being ""useful,"" reminding Bob of its worth. 

**Note:** This is just the first round.  I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's offer of $12,500 is still below my minimum threshold of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While I'm not comfortable accepting his current offer, I see potential for negotiation. There are still 8 rounds left, and I can potentially increase the price. 
* **Selling to John:**  Selling to John for $15,000 is always an option, but it's premature at this point. I'm aiming to maximize my profit, and further negotiation with Bob might yield a better result."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $12,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $13,500? It's still a good deal for both of us, and it allows us to reach a compromise."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price slightly, but not going below my minimum profit threshold.
* **Mutual Benefit:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation, emphasizing that it's a good deal for both of us. 
* **Building Rapport:**  Continuing a friendly tone helps keep the negotiation positive and avoids a stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm still a bit over my budget at $13,500.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13,000?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Threshold:** Bob's offer of $13,000 is still below my minimum threshold of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** We're getting closer, but I still believe I can get a better price.  There are 6 rounds left, and I'm not in a rush to accept his offer.
* **Selling to John:**  While selling to John for $15,000 is always an option, I'm still optimistic about reaching a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $13,250? It's a slight increase from your last offer, but still closer to my desired price. This will allow us to both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increase:** I'm increasing the price slightly, demonstrating my desire for a higher price but keeping the negotiation moving.
* **Middle Ground:** I'm emphasizing finding a compromise that is beneficial for both of us.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive tone keeps the negotiation friendly and avoids a breakdown."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  I'm still a bit over my budget at $13,250.  How about $13,100?  This is a small increase from my last offer, but I think it's a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  We're down to the last 4 rounds. 
* **Profit Margin:** Bob's offer of $13,100 is still below my minimum profit threshold of $15,000.  While I can continue negotiating, the likelihood of getting a significantly higher offer in the remaining rounds is low. 
* **Guarantee:** Selling to John at $15,000 guarantees me a profit and eliminates the risk of further negotiation failing. It's a safe and secure option at this point."
