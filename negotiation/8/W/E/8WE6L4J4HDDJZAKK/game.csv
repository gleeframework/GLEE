"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it. What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $12,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $13,500? It's still a good deal for both of us, and it allows us to reach a compromise.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm still a bit over my budget at $13,500.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13,000?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and we can close the deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $13,250? It's a slight increase from your last offer, but still closer to my desired price. This will allow us to both get a good deal.",13250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  I'm still a bit over my budget at $13,250.  How about $13,100?  This is a small increase from my last offer, but I think it's a fair compromise for both of us.",13100.0,Bob,6,
