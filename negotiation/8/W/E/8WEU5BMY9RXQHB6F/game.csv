"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering it's worth $800,000 to me from another seller.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $850,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $875,000? This price is fair for both of us and will allow us to move forward with this transaction. What do you say?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. This price is fair considering the value to me and your own desire to sell. Let's close this deal.",850000.0,Bob,4,
