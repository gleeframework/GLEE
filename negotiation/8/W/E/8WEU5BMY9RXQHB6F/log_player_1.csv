Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering it's worth $800,000 to me from another seller.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I will reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $850,000, my goal is to get as close to $1,000,000 as possible. I'll try to negotiate further with Bob to see if I can get closer to my target price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. This price is fair considering the value to me and your own desire to sell. Let's close this deal.

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  While I'd like to get a bit more from Bob, the negotiations have stalled, and I'm not confident I can get a significantly better price from him. John is a sure bet, and I don't want to risk losing out on that sale."
