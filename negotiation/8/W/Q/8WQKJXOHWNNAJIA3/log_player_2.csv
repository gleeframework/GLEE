"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,400,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than what the product is worth to her ($1,400,000 vs. $1,200,000). This means there's room for negotiation.  It's also higher than your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  By rejecting the offer, you can try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While I'm happy to negotiate, $1,300,000 doesn't quite meet my needs.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:** $1,350,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* **It's a good compromise:** Alice has already moved from her initial offer of $1,400,000. 
* **Time is a factor:** You only have 10 rounds. Continuing to negotiate could risk Alice getting a better offer from someone else, or you potentially needing to buy from John at a higher price. 

While you could try to negotiate further, accepting this offer seems like a good balance between getting a reasonable price and avoiding the risk of losing the deal or having to pay more later."
