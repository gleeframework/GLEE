"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,400,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Opening Offer:** Starting at $1,400,000 allows for room to negotiate while still securing a significant profit.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the potential for a good deal.
* **Room for Counteroffer:**  I've left space for Bob to counter without immediately rejecting his potential offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,300,000 is still a good profit, it's worth pushing for a higher price. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point with more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I'm happy to negotiate, $1,300,000 doesn't quite meet my needs.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm proposing a midpoint between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a reasonable profit.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm highlighting the ""fair compromise"" and the ""great deal"" to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Open for Discussion:** I end with a question, inviting Bob to respond and potentially continue the negotiation."
