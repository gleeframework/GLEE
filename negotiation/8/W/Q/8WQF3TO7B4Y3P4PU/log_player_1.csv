Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits you'll gain. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you start the negotiation significantly above Bob's perceived value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $1,300,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate up while still securing a price well above his $800,000 valuation. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value and potential"" to justify the high price without revealing your bottom line.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to potentially negotiate with Bob if he counters.  Remember, any price above $1,500,000 is a win for you!"
