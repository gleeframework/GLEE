"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $850,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise considering its value to you and the minimum price I'm willing to accept.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I understand you need to make a profit, $1,050,000 is still outside my budget.  Let's try $950,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects the value I place on this product.  I'm confident this price is mutually beneficial.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $950,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum acceptable price. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit.  I can go up to $975,000 for this product.  That's a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to a deal. Let's make this happen.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, $975,000 is still a bit short of my minimum price. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking of $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum acceptable price. Let's see if we can seal the deal.",1150000.0,Alice,7,
