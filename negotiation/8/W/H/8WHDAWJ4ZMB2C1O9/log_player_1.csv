Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $10,000. I believe this price represents a fair deal considering its value."", ""product_price"": 10000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aiming for a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) increases potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $10,000 allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle the price down. 
* **Secure a Sale:**  While a higher price is tempting, it increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer and forcing you to sell to John for $8,000. 

This strategy balances risk and reward, aiming for a price that is appealing to Bob while still generating a significant profit for Alice."
