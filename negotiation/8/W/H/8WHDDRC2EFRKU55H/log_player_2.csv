{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget. It makes sense to reject and see if we can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, well below Alice's initial price, to gauge her willingness to negotiate.  This sets the stage for a more balanced conversation and hopefully leads to a price closer to my budget."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my ideal price point. I'm going to continue to try and negotiate a lower price.  There are still several rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing my offer slightly from the last round.  This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product but also that I'm not willing to pay her full asking price. I'm hoping this will lead to a quicker agreement within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, but I'm still not willing to pay that much. I'm confident I can get a better deal if I keep negotiating. I've only had one round where I haven't made a counteroffer, and there are still several rounds left. I'm going to try to push for a price closer to $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm making a final push to get the price down to my maximum budget. This is my last counteroffer before I need to decide whether to buy from Alice or John. If Alice rejects this offer, I'll move on to John to avoid risking further negotiation."
