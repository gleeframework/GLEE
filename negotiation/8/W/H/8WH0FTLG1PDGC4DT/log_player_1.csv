Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'd like to offer $13,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $13,500 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

``` 

Bob's offer of $13,500 is a good compromise, and it's closer to my target price than what John would offer.  It's worth accepting the deal."
