Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $175. I believe it's a great deal and would be very valuable to you."", 
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $175 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate the price down, while still ensuring you make more than your minimum. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This first offer helps gauge Bob's interest level. If he accepts immediately, you've maximized your profit. If he rejects or negotiates, you can adjust accordingly knowing you have John as a backup."
