"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000.  This is a strong opening offer, demonstrating my belief in the product's value.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate.  If he's not, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000. This is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to negotiate, but still pushing for a price closer to my initial offer. I'm aiming for a middle ground that might be acceptable to Bob, while also giving me a good return on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $875,000 is getting closer to my floor price, I'm still hoping to squeeze out a bit more. I'm going to counter with a slightly higher price in the next round.  I believe there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

I'm going to counter with $925,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and my previous counteroffer. I'm hoping this will be acceptable to him, as it's closer to his price point while still giving me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is tempting, I'm still not willing to settle for that price. I believe I can push for a bit more, especially since we're nearing the end of the negotiation process.  I'm going to counter with a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000.  This is a significant compromise from my previous offer and signals a strong desire to close the deal.  I'm hoping that Bob recognizes this as a fair price point. If he doesn't, I'll have to seriously consider John's offer, as we're running out of time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, the time pressure is high. Bob's offer of $875,000 is getting closer to my floor price, but it's still not ideal. There's a good chance he'll reject my next counteroffer, leaving me with no deal.  I'd rather take the guaranteed $800,000 from John than risk getting nothing at all."
