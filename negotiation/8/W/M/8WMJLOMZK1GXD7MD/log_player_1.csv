Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with an offer of $1,000,000. This is a significant amount, but it's still below Bob's perceived value of the product, leaving room for negotiation. I'm confident Bob will see the value in this offer, but if he rejects it, I'll be prepared to counter his offer while keeping my minimum acceptable price in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can still secure a better price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm offering $950,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $920,000 is a fair price, considering he rejected my previous offer. It's above my minimum price and within a reasonable range for both of us. Accepting his offer ensures a smooth transaction and a good profit for me."
