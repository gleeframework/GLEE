"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we split the difference at $8,500?  It's still a great price for you, considering the value you'll get from this product.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $7,000 might be a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $7,750? That's a fair compromise, I think.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $7,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but let's meet at $8,250.  This price is fair for both of us, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",8250.0,Alice,5,
