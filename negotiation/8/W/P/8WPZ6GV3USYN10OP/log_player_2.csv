"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity to get something truly valuable. Considering its worth and benefits, I'm extending this offer to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice first.  $120 is a bit too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to move the price significantly closer to my $100 limit. There's room for further negotiation if Alice rejects it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I'd like to make a counterproposal. Considering the value of the product and your interest, I'm willing to offer it to you for $95. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $95 is better, I think there's still room for negotiation. I'll try to meet Alice halfway between our last two offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we meet in the middle at $87.50?"",
""product_price"": 87.50
}
``` 
This keeps the negotiation moving while aiming for a price closer to my target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're still interested, Bob. I'm willing to consider your proposal. For the product, I would be able to offer it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $90, and it's a reasonable price compared to John's $100 offer. It's time to accept the deal."
