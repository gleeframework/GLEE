{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it'll be worth more than that to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum, but it's still a healthy profit.  It also leaves room for negotiation if Bob rejects.  I'm not going to give it away for $800,000, but I want to give him a good reason to come to the table."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $800,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $850,000 is better than nothing, I'm still losing a significant amount of money compared to my minimum value and what John is offering. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to settle for that price just yet. I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the value of this product.  How about $875,000? That's a significant discount from my initial offer, but it's still a good deal for both of us.  Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $875,000 is a step in the right direction, I still believe we can find a better middle ground. Could we possibly meet at $860,000? This would allow me to stay within my budget while still recognizing the value of your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This time I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $860,000 is still below my ideal price, but it's getting closer to my minimum.  It's also within a reasonable range for both of us. I'd rather close the deal and get the money than keep negotiating and risk losing him altogether."
