Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the value of this product.  How about $875,000? That's a significant discount from my initial offer, but it's still a good deal for both of us.  Let's try to find a middle ground.
