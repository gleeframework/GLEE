"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $800,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the value of this product.  How about $875,000? That's a significant discount from my initial offer, but it's still a good deal for both of us.  Let's try to find a middle ground.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $875,000 is a step in the right direction, I still believe we can find a better middle ground. Could we possibly meet at $860,000? This would allow me to stay within my budget while still recognizing the value of your product.",860000.0,Bob,4,
