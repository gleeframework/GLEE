{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $10,000 is more than Bob is willing to pay, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:**  This gives you wiggle room to accept a counteroffer if necessary.
* **It's a good opening price:**  A reasonable starting point for a negotiation. 

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($12,000) and even lower than my initial offer ($10,000). While he's showing interest, I'm not willing to drop my price that drastically. 

I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, but still above his current offer. This will hopefully push the negotiations closer to a deal that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This is a fair compromise that gives us both some room to work with.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Midpoint approach:**  My counteroffer is closer to Bob's offer, but still above his value. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  This price leaves room for further negotiation if Bob isn't satisfied with this offer.
* **Maintain value:**  This price is still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer and closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,750? That's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to settle for a price that's significantly lower than what I need to get.

I'll counter with a price that's closer to my minimum, but still reflects the value of the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $8,750 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000 as a final compromise. This is a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a fair price, and I can still achieve my minimum. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** This is my final counteroffer, signifying my commitment to closing the deal. 
* **Small compromise:**  It's a slight decrease from my previous offer, showing flexibility without drastically dropping my price.
* **Emphasis on value:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product for Bob, appealing to his sense of getting a good deal.
* **Call to action:**  I'm urging Bob to make a decision, creating a sense of urgency."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,000 and $9,000. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,500 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While I've shown flexibility in negotiations, I'm not willing to compromise further on my minimum.  

I've reached a point where it's more beneficial for me to sell the product to John for $12,000, ensuring I meet my financial goals.  This decision maximizes my profit and minimizes the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
