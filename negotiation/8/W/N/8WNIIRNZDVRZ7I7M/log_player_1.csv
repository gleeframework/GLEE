Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and presents a significant return on investment for you."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially still landing within a very profitable range for Alice.
* **Alternative Buyer:** While John provides a safety net, the aim is to secure the higher profit from Bob.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and ensuring Bob finds the offer enticing enough to accept."
