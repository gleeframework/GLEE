Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to spend less, but I still believe the product's value is significant. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $750,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and takes into account your desire to spend less.

Alice is coming down, but I can likely get a better price.  Let's see if we can squeeze a bit more."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get as close as possible to your target price, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you at $725,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value.

While I could try to negotiate further, the price is now very close to my target.  At this point, it's probably not worth risking losing the deal with Alice."
