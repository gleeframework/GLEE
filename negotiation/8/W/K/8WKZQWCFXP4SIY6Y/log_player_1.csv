Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. Given the value of the product to me, I'm willing to offer $950,000.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
