"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation while still being profitable for me.
* **Positive message:**  I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to build a rapport with Bob and encourage him to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Focus on value:**  I highlight the value of the product to Bob, reminding him of its potential benefits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $1,000,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I have 9 rounds left and the option to sell to John for my desired price. It's worth exploring further negotiation with Bob to try and achieve a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your interest. While $1,000,000 is a fair price for the product, I'm hoping we can find a compromise that works for both of us.  I'm willing to lower my price to $1,150,000.  This gives you a significant discount and allows me to cover my costs. Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's position:** I start by acknowledging Bob's stance and expressing appreciation for his interest. This helps build a positive rapport and shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Counteroffer with justification:**  I offer a counteroffer of $1,150,000, which is still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer.  I justify this price by emphasizing the discount it offers him while still allowing me to cover my costs.
* **Focus on finding a compromise:**  I re-emphasize the goal of finding a compromise that benefits both of us. This creates a collaborative tone and encourages Bob to see the value in reaching a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my position, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,075,000 for the product. I believe this offers a reasonable compromise for both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is closer to my minimum, it is still significantly lower than my ideal price. I have 6 rounds remaining and the opportunity to sell to John for my desired price. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Bob to see if I can push for a higher price. There is still room for compromise without significantly jeopardizing my desired profit margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. This price would allow me to cover my costs and make this deal a success for both of us. Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's offer:** I acknowledge Bob's counteroffer to show I'm actively listening and engaging in the negotiation.
* **Counter with a justified price:** I offer a counteroffer of $1,125,000. This is a smaller concession than Bob's last offer, demonstrating my commitment to securing a more profitable deal. I justify this price by emphasizing that it would allow me to cover my costs and make the deal successful for both parties.
* **Focus on collaboration:** I reiterate the goal of finding a solution that works for both parties, fostering a sense of partnership and encouraging Bob to consider a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts in negotiating, Alice. Considering our previous discussions, I would like to propose a price of $1,100,000 for the product. This price offers a fair compromise between our positions and would allow me to stay within my budget while ensuring a profitable transaction for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is now very close to my desired price point. While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,150,000, I'm running out of time.  I only have 4 rounds left, and there's no guarantee that further negotiation will result in a higher price. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is always an option, but I'd rather secure a deal with Bob at this point.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and allows me to move on to other opportunities."
