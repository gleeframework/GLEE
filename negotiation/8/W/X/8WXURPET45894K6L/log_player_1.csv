{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. I think it's a great deal considering its value, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $130 is more than the $80 Bob is willing to pay, but it leaves some room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:**  $130 is still above your minimum of $150, giving you some wiggle room. 
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** This offer is not overly aggressive, allowing for a smooth negotiation. 

By sending this offer, you are initiating the negotiation while setting a clear price expectation. You are also showing flexibility by leaving room for a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I am looking for a price closer to $80. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $80 is significantly below your minimum price of $150 and even below your initial offer of $130. 
* **Opportunity cost:** Accepting Bob's offer would mean losing out on a guaranteed $150 from John.
* **Negotiation potential:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you are demonstrating your willingness to negotiate while also setting a clear expectation that you will not accept a price significantly lower than your initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $80 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** The counteroffer of $100 is a compromise between your initial offer of $130 and Bob's offer of $80.
* **Fair Value:** You're still making a profit, and the price is closer to what Bob is willing to pay. 
* **Open to Further Negotiation:** You're leaving room for another counteroffer, showing flexibility and a willingness to find a mutually agreeable price.

By sending this counteroffer, you are demonstrating your flexibility while still maintaining your negotiating position. You're also encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation and potentially reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still looking for a price closer to $80. Could we possibly meet in the middle at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still below your minimum:** $90 is still below your minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Potential for a better deal:** While $90 is closer to your minimum, there is still potential to negotiate a higher price.  You haven't reached a point where the risk of continuing the negotiation outweighs the potential reward.
* **John's offer:** You have a guaranteed $150 from John, making the risk of accepting Bob's offer even higher.

By rejecting Bob's offer, you are demonstrating your commitment to maximizing your profit while still being open to further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $90 is still a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $95?  This would allow us both to get a fair deal. "", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This counteroffer is exactly halfway between your previous offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $90, showing a clear attempt to find a compromise. 
* **Maintaining profit:** $95 is still above your minimum acceptable price of $150, ensuring you make a profit.
* **Encouraging a deal:** This counteroffer is a strong signal that you're serious about reaching an agreement and are willing to negotiate further.

By sending this counteroffer, you are demonstrating a strong commitment to finding a mutually beneficial solution while still maintaining a solid negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your continued willingness to negotiate. I'm still aiming for a price closer to $80. Considering our previous discussions, could we agree on $92 as a fair price for both of us? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Profit maximization:** While $92 is a decent price, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $150. You are guaranteed a profit of $150 by selling to John, making it the most financially advantageous option.
* **Negotiation fatigue:** The negotiation has been ongoing for several rounds, and the price difference between your offers and Bob's offers is not significant enough to warrant further negotiation. 
* **Limited potential:**  Bob has shown a clear preference for a price closer to $80, making it unlikely that he will significantly increase his offer.

By selling to John, you are maximizing your profit and avoiding the potential for a prolonged negotiation that may not lead to a better outcome."
