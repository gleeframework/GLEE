Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to come down.
* **Justification:** The phrase ""given its value"" subtly implies that the product is worth the higher price. 
* **Leaving the Door Open:** By asking ""What do you think?"", you invite Bob to counter-offer and engage in negotiation rather than just giving a flat yes or no.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While you know the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, he might not be willing to pay that much. There's always a chance he'll reject the offer.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $15,000 provides you with a strong fallback position. You're never truly at risk of losing money."
