"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,200,000. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth at least that much to you.  Let's make this quick and easy. What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'm not sure I can meet your price. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low.  It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm sure we can find a price that's fair for both of us. How about $1,100,000?  I'm willing to be flexible, but let's not waste any more time. ",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort, but $1,025,000 is still a bit low for me. I know it's a valuable product for you, and I'm willing to compromise. How about $1,050,000? That's a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. Let's make a deal and move forward.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to get a good price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. Can we meet somewhere in the middle at $1,012,500?",1012500.0,Bob,6,
