Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,200,000. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth at least that much to you.  Let's make this quick and easy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'm not sure I can meet your price. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum desired price of $1,000,000.  I'm going to try and negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low.  It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm sure we can find a price that's fair for both of us. How about $1,100,000?  I'm willing to be flexible, but let's not waste any more time. "", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum desired price, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I have a few rounds left and I'm confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your effort, but $1,025,000 is still a bit low for me. I know it's a valuable product for you, and I'm willing to compromise. How about $1,050,000? That's a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. Let's make a deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to get a good price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. Can we meet somewhere in the middle at $1,012,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,012,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,012,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,012,500 is still a bit below my ideal price, it's getting close to my minimum threshold. With only four rounds left, it's getting risky to keep pushing for a higher price.  Accepting this offer secures a profit and prevents the risk of Bob backing out completely or me having to settle for the $1,000,000 offer from John."
