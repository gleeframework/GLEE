"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that's worth at least $10000 to me. I believe it has the potential to be even more valuable to you, depending on your specific needs.  I'm willing to sell it for $15000. If you're not interested, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $10000. This is a chance to get a valuable asset at a potentially significant discount.  Let me know your thoughts.",15000.0,Alice,1,
