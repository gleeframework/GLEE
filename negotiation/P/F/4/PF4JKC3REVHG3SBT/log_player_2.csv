# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $20,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $8,000 at this time. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and your counter-offer. I understand that $20,000 is a significant investment. While I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000, I'm open to finding a middle ground. How about we meet halfway at $14,000? This price reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his limit. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a price closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $14,000 is closer, it's still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. Let's settle this at $12,500.  This offer takes into account both our positions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer, it's still above Bob's limit. He can still try to negotiate further, aiming for a price closer to $10,000. If that fails, he can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000. This is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product while staying within my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, we're getting close. I appreciate your persistence in this negotiation.  While $11,000 is still under my ideal price, I'm willing to accept $11,750.  This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's ideal price of $8,000.  Even though Alice has indicated this is her final offer, there's no guarantee she won't change her mind again in the next round. Since Bob has the option to buy from John for $8,000, it's the most sensible choice to avoid further negotiation and ensure he gets the product at the lowest possible price."
