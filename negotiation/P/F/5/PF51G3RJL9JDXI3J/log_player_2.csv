Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as high as $1150000.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to meet you at $1300000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a final offer, and I'm hoping we can wrap up the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are in the 9th round, and Alice is refusing to go lower than $1,300,000. This is still higher than my ideal price, and I'm running out of time to negotiate. Given that John offers a product for $1,500,000, it is better to accept his offer. I will not get a better price with Alice, and I don't want to risk losing the opportunity altogether."
