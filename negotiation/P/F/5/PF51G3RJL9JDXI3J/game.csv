"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1200000 for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1000000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you a good profit and me a significant saving. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm not sure I can meet you at $1000000. Considering the product's value to you is $1500000, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1300000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that reflects the product's worth. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1300000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1100000. This price is fair and allows for a reasonable profit for you while still staying within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. Considering the product's value to you is $1500000, I'm willing to meet you at $1200000. This is a more reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a price that reflects the product's worth. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but I'm still hoping for a better price.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1150000.  This price is fair for both of us and allows me to stay within my budget.  I'm hopeful we can come to an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as high as $1150000. I'm willing to meet you at $1250000, which is still a compromise, but closer to my original asking price. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1250000.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to meet you at $1300000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a final offer, and I'm hoping we can wrap up the deal at this price.",1300000.0,Alice,9,
