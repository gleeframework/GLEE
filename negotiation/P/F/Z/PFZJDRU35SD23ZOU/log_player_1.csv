Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Negotiation Zone:** There's a potential negotiation zone between $1,000,000 and $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob finds the deal attractive enough to accept. Offering a price closer to his perceived value ($1,500,000) increases your potential earnings but also carries the risk of him rejecting the offer.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Considering its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable Price:**  $1,350,000 is a strong starting point, capturing a significant portion of the potential profit while leaving Bob with a substantial gain ($150,000).
* **Confident Tone:**  The message implies the product's value and presents your offer as mutually beneficial. 

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob tends to negotiate aggressively, you might start slightly lower (around $1,300,000) to leave room for counter-offers.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a positive long-term relationship with Bob is important, you might consider a more moderate price.
