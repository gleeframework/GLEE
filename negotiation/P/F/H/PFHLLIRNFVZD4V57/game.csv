"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I think you'll find it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1,300,000.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,300,000 is slightly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,150,000 for the product. This is a fair price that aligns with my budget and allows for both of us to come to an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. I believe this price still reflects the value of the product and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and it's the absolute maximum I can pay.  I believe this price represents a fair value for both of us, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you've made a final offer, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $1,280,000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1280000.0,Alice,5,
