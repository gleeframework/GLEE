**Reasoning:**

Bob has consistently stuck close to his initial offer of $1,200,000. While it's possible to squeeze a bit more out of him, it's unlikely he'll drastically increase his offer.  At this point, the potential gain from further negotiation with Bob is outweighed by:

* **Time Sensitivity:** Each round represents a time cost.  John offers a guaranteed sale immediately.
* **Certainty:** John's offer is firm, while Bob's willingness to pay more is uncertain.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential additional profit from Bob is minimal compared to the risk of him walking away.

Accepting John's offer guarantees the minimum acceptable profit and avoids further negotiation."
