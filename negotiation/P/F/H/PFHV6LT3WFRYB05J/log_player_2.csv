"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be incredibly valuable to you. While I can't disclose specifics without a non-disclosure agreement, I can assure you it's worth at least $1.2 million to me.  I'm offering it to you for $1500000, a price that reflects its potential.  If you're interested, let's schedule a time to discuss it further.  I'm confident this is an opportunity you won't want to miss. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. 
* Although she claims the product is worth $1.2 million to her, you have no way to verify that. 
* It's always best to err on the side of caution when dealing with an unknown product and a high price.
* You can get the same product from John for a much lower price, making it the more logical choice."
