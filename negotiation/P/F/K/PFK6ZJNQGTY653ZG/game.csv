"I'm very interested in the product, but $1,250,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",1150000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your interest in the product.  While $1,150,000 is closer, I'm still a bit above my target. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,200,000? This would be a great deal for both of us, and we could finalise the sale quickly.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I still think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to meet you at $1,150,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Can you consider that?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget. I'm willing to make a final concession and offer the product for $1,175,000. This is my best price, but it's still above my minimum. Let me know if you're able to accept. If not, I'll have to move on to other opportunities.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final concession, but $1,175,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,150,000 and $1,175,000, so I'll offer $1,162,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1162500.0,Bob,6,
