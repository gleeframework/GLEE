{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me some leeway if Bob counteroffers. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  A $250,000 gap between my starting price and Bob's perceived value allows for some back and forth without me going below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm highlighting the benefit for Bob (""great deal for both of us""). This might encourage him to consider accepting.

**Important Note:**  This is just the starting point.  I'll need to carefully assess Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his actions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but $1,250,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired profit margin. 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  I believe I can still get a higher price by continuing the negotiation. 
* **Playing the Long Game:**  Rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, which might make him more willing to compromise.

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired amount, aiming to bridge the gap between our current positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your interest in the product.  While $1,150,000 is closer, I'm still a bit above my target. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,200,000? This would be a great deal for both of us, and we could finalise the sale quickly."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromising, but Not Giving In:** I'm moving slightly closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility, but still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the mutual benefits of the deal and highlighting the potential for a quick and easy transaction. 
* **Maintaining My Stance:**  My counteroffer demonstrates that I'm not willing to drop my price significantly and that I'm confident in the value of the product.

**Next Steps:** I'll closely monitor Bob's response and be prepared to adjust my strategy if necessary. If Bob rejects this offer, I might consider a final concession, but I'll still be mindful of my minimum acceptable price and the option of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I still think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to meet you at $1,150,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob's counteroffer is the same as his previous one. This suggests he's not willing to budge further. 
* **Risk of Losing a Better Deal:**  If I accept Bob's offer, I'll be leaving $350,000 on the table compared to selling to John.
* **Last Chance for Compromise:**  I'll make one final counteroffer to see if I can bridge the gap. 

**Next Steps:**  I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly closer to his offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. This will be my final attempt to secure a better deal before potentially selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget. I'm willing to make a final concession and offer the product for $1,175,000. This is my best price, but it's still above my minimum. Let me know if you're able to accept. If not, I'll have to move on to other opportunities."", ""product_price"": 1175000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Concession:** This is my last offer, showing Bob that I'm serious about closing the deal but also emphasizing the limitations of my negotiation.
* **Bridge the Gap:** The offer is a small compromise on my part, acknowledging Bob's budget constraints while remaining above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Creating Urgency:** The message conveys a sense of urgency, implying that I'm open to other options if Bob doesn't accept. This might encourage him to close the deal.

**Next Steps:** This will be my final offer. If Bob rejects it, I will proceed with selling the product to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final concession, but $1,175,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,150,000 and $1,175,000, so I'll offer $1,162,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,162,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,162,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:** Bob's final offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  There's little room for further compromise, and he's made it clear that he's not willing to go higher.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing a much more lucrative deal with John. 
* **Time is Money:**  Prolonging the negotiations with Bob could take more time and energy, ultimately costing me more in the long run.

**Final Decision:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is the most financially advantageous decision, even though it's a better deal for him than for Bob."
