"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1,100,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the price down, but I'm still not comfortable going below $1,050,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",975000.0,Alice,5,
