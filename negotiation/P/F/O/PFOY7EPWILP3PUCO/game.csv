"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it, which is still a good deal for you given its worth to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering its worth to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget, but $1,100,000 is still beyond what I can comfortably afford. Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me and leaves some room for you to profit.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, but $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you considering its worth to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try to split the difference. I'm prepared to offer $980,000 for the product. This is a fair price that gets us both closer to a deal.",980000.0,Bob,6,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $1,025,000 is getting closer to my budget, I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price.  I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me and leaves some room for you to profit.  Let's try to come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,8,
