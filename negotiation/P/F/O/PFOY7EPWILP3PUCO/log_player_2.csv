"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,200,000 is well above his budget of $800,000. He has room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it, which is still a good deal for you given its worth to me."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering its worth to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $1,100,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still too high for Bob. He should keep negotiating and try to get closer to his budget.  There's still time to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget, but $1,100,000 is still beyond what I can comfortably afford. Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me and leaves some room for you to profit."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, but $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

Bob should still reject the offer. While $1,050,000 is getting closer to his budget, there's still room to negotiate further. He should continue to try and get a lower price from Alice.  He has a few rounds left to make a deal."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $1,025,000 is getting closer to my budget, I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price.  I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but $1,000,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $800,000.  He's getting closer to his target price with Alice, but it seems unlikely he'll get Alice to budge any lower. It's better to secure the product now at a price he's comfortable with rather than risking further negotiation."
