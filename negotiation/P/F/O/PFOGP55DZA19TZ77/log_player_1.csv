Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your effort. I would like to propose a price of $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, it's still far below what I'm willing to accept. I'm going to try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. How about $110? This is still a great price for you, as you'll be getting the product for less than what it's worth to you."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $105. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $105 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I believe I can get a better price with a little more negotiation.  I'm going to try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I still need to make a profit on this product.  $105 isn't quite there yet.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to sell the product for $108.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 108}
