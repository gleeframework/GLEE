"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll really love it, and I'm confident you'll be willing to pay a premium for it. I'm offering it to you for $1,800,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product is very interesting, but $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,800,000 might be a bit high for you, Bob. However, I believe the product is worth more than $1,400,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,600,000. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $1,600,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $1,550,000?  That's a fair compromise and allows both of us to walk away happy.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see that you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $1,580,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",1580000.0,Alice,5,
