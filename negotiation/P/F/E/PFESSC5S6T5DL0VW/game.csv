"Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit too high for me right now.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your initial offer, the product's value significantly exceeds that.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the true potential of what I'm offering.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but that's still a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing some hesitancy on your end regarding the price. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,700,000? I'm confident that the value you'll gain from this product will far exceed this investment.",1700000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm still interested but we're pretty far apart on price.  To be honest, anything much above $1,000,000 is going to be a tough sell for me. I could do $1,050,000 today to get this done.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty.  I've tried to make this work and believe the value this product offers is substantial.  I'm willing to consider a final offer of $1,450,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, but I want to see this deal closed.",1450000.0,Alice,7,
