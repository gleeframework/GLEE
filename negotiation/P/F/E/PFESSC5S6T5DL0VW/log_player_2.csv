**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but she's still significantly above your maximum budget and even further above what John is offering.  At this point, it's unlikely Alice will come down to a price that makes sense for you, especially since she called her last offer ""final."" Cutting your losses and going with John guarantees you the product at the best possible price for you."
