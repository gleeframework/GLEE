"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $135? ",135.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $135 is a good compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to sell it for that price. How about we meet in the middle again and go for $142? I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",142.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $142 is still a little high for me.  Let's try $138. It's a fair price and closer to what I can afford.  What do you think? ",138.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your latest offer of $138 is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still not willing to sell it for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and go for $140. It's the highest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,5,
