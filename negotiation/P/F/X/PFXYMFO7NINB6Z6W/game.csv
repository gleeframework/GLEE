"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,350,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1350000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground there.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer and for recognizing the value of this product. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm confident we can find a middle ground. How about we settle on $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,225,000 is getting closer, but I'm still aiming for a bit lower.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,162,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",1162500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product and I respect that.  While $1,162,500 is a tempting offer, I'm holding firm on a price closer to $1,200,000.  Would you consider $1,190,000?  This feels like a fair compromise to me.",1190000.0,Alice,5,
