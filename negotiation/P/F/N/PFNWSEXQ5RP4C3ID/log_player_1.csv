"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000.  This is a bold move, but it sets the stage for potential negotiation. It shows I believe in the value of the product, and it gives me room to lower the price if necessary. I'll be watching Bob's reaction closely to see if he's even remotely interested at this price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is a good offer, it's still below my desired price. I'm going to reject it and see if I can push for a higher price. I have 8 rounds left and I'm confident I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 980000}
```

I'm countering with $980,000. This is a small concession, but it shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.  I believe I can still secure a price closer to my initial ask. If Bob is truly serious about buying, he should be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my bottom line, I still have 6 rounds left and I'm hoping to squeeze a little more out of the deal. I'm not ready to settle just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway and counter with $950,000.  This is a significant concession, but I think it's the best move to keep the negotiation going.  If Bob accepts, I've secured a good price. If he rejects, I still have several rounds left to work with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is close to my floor, I still have a few rounds left and I'm determined to get closer to my desired price. I believe I can still squeeze a little more out of this negotiation.  I'm not ready to settle just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 930000}
```

I'm countering with $930,000. This is a small concession, but I'm getting closer to Bob's offer.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground and secure a deal that is fair to both of us.  If Bob rejects this, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'm not thrilled with the price, it's above my floor and I only have two rounds left. There's a significant risk of getting a worse offer or even having to sell to John for $800,000.  It's time to secure the deal and move on."
