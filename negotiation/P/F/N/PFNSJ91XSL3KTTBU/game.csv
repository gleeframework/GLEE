"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,100,000 price point. Would you consider lowering the price to $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budgetary considerations.  While that price doesn't quite reflect the value I see in this deal for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000.  This offer represents a significant discount and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given my current financial situation, I am proposing a price of $975,000 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for us.",975000.0,Bob,4,
