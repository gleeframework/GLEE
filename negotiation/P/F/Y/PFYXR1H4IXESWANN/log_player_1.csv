Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing your profit and ensuring a sale. Here's why:

* **For you:** You're earning $150,000 more than your minimum acceptable price.
* **For Bob:** He's getting the product for $50,000 less than its value to him. 

There's a good chance Bob will accept, as he still stands to gain a substantial amount. However, if he rejects, you have a guaranteed sale with John, so you're not taking a big risk."
