"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her value, it's still above your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a better deal.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to come down a bit closer to your $10,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  $10,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to go down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it would be a great deal for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now within my budget and is a good deal considering her initial price.  While I could potentially continue negotiating, it's likely she won't go any lower, and I risk her getting frustrated and potentially calling off the deal entirely. Accepting this offer secures the product at a price I'm comfortable with."
