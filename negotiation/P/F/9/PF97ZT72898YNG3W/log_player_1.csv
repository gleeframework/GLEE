Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $110. I believe it will be highly valuable to you."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120, so he's willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80 from the sale. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** By offering the product at $110, you leave some room for negotiation while aiming for a price significantly higher than your minimum. Bob is likely to accept this offer as it saves him $10 compared to his maximum valuation.
* **Alternative Buyer:** While you have John as a backup buyer, selling to Bob at a higher price is more profitable."
