"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $110. I believe it will be highly valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see why:

* **Alice's Offer:** $110
* **John's Price:** $120
* **Your Maximum:** $120

While Alice's offer is below your maximum, you can do better. By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're looking for a lower price.  There's a chance she'll come back with a better deal, and if not, you can always buy from John."
