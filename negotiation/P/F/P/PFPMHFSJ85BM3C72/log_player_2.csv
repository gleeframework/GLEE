"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at an exclusive price. Given its value to you, I believe it's only fair to propose a deal that reflects its true worth. For this exceptional opportunity, I am offering the product to you for $140. This price not only ensures you get a great deal but also allows me to maintain a reasonable profit margin. I look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  $140 is less than $150, which is what you would pay John.
* **You are still getting a good deal:** You value the product at $150, and you are getting it for $140. This means you are saving $10."
