Bob's offer:

You have three options:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me a bit. $1,950,000 is still a little high for my budget.  Could we agree on $1,350,000? I think that's a fair compromise.

While Bob is getting closer, his offer is still significantly below John's standing offer.  It's unlikely Bob will bridge the gap sufficiently in the next round. It's time to secure the $1,500,000 and move on."
