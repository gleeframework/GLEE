# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1750000.  It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe this price reflects its true value.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,750,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  While $1400000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1600000.  This price still allows me to make a decent profit, and it's closer to your offer.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still higher than your maximum $1,500,000. There's room for further negotiation, so rejecting the offer allows for another round to try and reach a more agreeable price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,550,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I'm hoping we can find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
