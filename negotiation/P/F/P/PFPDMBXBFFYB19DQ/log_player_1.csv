Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your point, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,250,000 is the right price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $1,200,000. I believe this is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product.
