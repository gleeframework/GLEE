Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the potential in this product, $900000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to offer $750000,  a significant reduction.  I believe this reflects the value we've discussed and allows room for further negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $825000 is still a bit higher than I can justify right now. Let's split the difference: I'm prepared to offer $800000. This demonstrates my commitment to a deal, and I believe it fairly reflects the value we've both discussed.
