"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to begin negotiations with an ambitious offer. This anchors the discussion at a higher point and leaves room for concessions. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""value and potential"" subtly justifies the high price without explicitly stating your minimum.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrasing ""confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement""  signals a willingness to negotiate. 

This strategy aims to gauge Bob's eagerness and provides insight into his valuation of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  That starting price is a bit too high for me, but I'm very interested in the product. Would you consider $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is significantly below both your minimum price and his own perceived value of the product. Accepting would mean a substantial loss for you.  While selling to John is an option, it's still early in the negotiation with Bob. There's room to explore if you can bridge the gap and secure a better deal than $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, to be frank, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true market value. I could consider a price of $1,750,000. This reflects the value this product brings while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong but Conciliatory:**  Acknowledging Bob's enthusiasm maintains a positive tone. The phrase ""significantly below its true market value"" reinforces the product's worth.
* **Strategic Concession:** Dropping from $2,000,000 to $1,750,000 is a substantial concession, designed to signal flexibility while still staying above your minimum. 
* **Justification:**  Framing the counteroffer as ""reflecting the value"" provides a reason beyond simply meeting in the middle. 

This approach aims to move the negotiation closer to your desired outcome while leaving room for further bargaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,375,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're making progress, but $1,375,000 is still less than what John is offering.  Bob is clearly interested and moving towards our desired price range.  There's potential to negotiate a better deal than John's guaranteed offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go as low as $1,375,000.  How about $1,600,000? This is a significant compromise on my end."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge Progress:** Recognizing that ""we're getting closer"" keeps the momentum positive and reinforces Bob's perception that a deal is achievable.
* **Firm but Flexible:** While stating you can't accept his offer, you reiterate your willingness to ""come down a bit further."" 
* **Strategic Concession:**  The decrease to $1,600,000 is less drastic than Bob's previous move. This signals you're approaching your limit but still open to a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Framing:** Highlighting this as a ""significant compromise"" aims to nudge Bob into making a more substantial move towards your target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your compromise is noted and I appreciate the movement. To be completely transparent, I have another offer on the table for $1,200,000.  If you can meet that, I'm ready to close the deal with you today.  Otherwise, I'll need to consider my options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has revealed his hand. His $1,200,000 offer is firm and represents the absolute maximum he's willing to pay.  It's also clear he has an alternative option. 

Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a price Bob is willing to accept that's also higher than John's offer.  It's time to cut your losses and secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
