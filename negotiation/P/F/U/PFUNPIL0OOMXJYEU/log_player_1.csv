```

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a strong opening position that leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident the product is worth more than $1,500,000 to me, and this price allows for some flexibility in the event of a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my starting price and lower than my minimum acceptable value.  I will reject his offer and counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,750,000. This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer. It keeps the negotiation moving forward and allows for further potential compromise if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'm comfortable with.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,600,000.  This is a slight decrease from my last offer, but still above Bob's latest offer. It demonstrates my willingness to compromise while maintaining a price I'm comfortable with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum value, I'm not confident we'll reach an agreement that satisfies me in the next round.  It's better to secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John rather than risk further negotiation with Bob."
