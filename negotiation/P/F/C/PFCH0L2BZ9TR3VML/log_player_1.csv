{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to reach a price that's acceptable for both of you.  It's important to remember that if Bob rejects your offer, you can always fall back on John's offer of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, I am only able to pay up to $1,200,000 for the product. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. You can potentially get a better price by continuing negotiations.  It's important to remember that if you reject Bob's counteroffer, you can always fall back on John's offer of $1,500,000."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still a bit below my target.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1250000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. While I understand the value of your product, I believe we can still reach an agreement. I would like to propose a price of $1,225,000. I hope this offers a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum acceptable price, it's still below your desired goal.  You've already negotiated a bit, and there's a chance that Bob won't budge further. It's more beneficial to sell to John at this point and secure the guaranteed $1,500,000."
