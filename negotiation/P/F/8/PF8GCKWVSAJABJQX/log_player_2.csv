"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm asking for $9,500. I think you'll be very pleased with this purchase! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $9,500 is still too high for Bob, as he values the product at $10,000. It's worth negotiating with Alice to see if a better price can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, but it's still within the range of what he's willing to pay.  He's hoping to find a middle ground quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $8,500 is a bit too low for the value this product offers.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still looking to save money. While $9,000 is closer to his target, he can likely still get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's compromise at $8,750. It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering a price closer to the middle ground. He's showing a willingness to compromise, but he's also still trying to get the best possible price.  This offer demonstrates that he's serious about buying the product, but also that he's not willing to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at $8,900? This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly, and $8,900 is a good price for Bob.  While he could potentially get a slightly lower price by continuing to negotiate, the risk of Alice walking away or Bob running out of rounds is high.  Accepting this offer is the most sensible choice given the current circumstances."
