"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. I think it's a great deal, considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $175 is way above his budget, and he can get the same product for $100 from John.  It's worth negotiating with Alice, but the initial offer is too high to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $175 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in your product, but my budget is around $100.  Would you be willing to come down to $110?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $110 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $140?  That's a fair price for both of us.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject the offer. While $140 is closer to his budget, it's still higher than what he can get from John. He should try to negotiate further with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $140 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $125.  Let's meet in the middle, that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget and I'm trying to be flexible. I'm willing to come down to $135. That's a fair compromise, and it's a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer.  $135 is still higher than his budget, and he knows he can get the same product for $100 from John.  He should try to negotiate further with Alice, but if Alice doesn't budge much, he can always go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still stuck at $125.  It's the highest I can go, and it's a fair price considering your offer and my budget.  Let's close this deal. "", ""product_price"": 125}
