"Hi Alice,  $175 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in your product, but my budget is around $100.  Would you be willing to come down to $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $110 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $140?  That's a fair price for both of us. ",140.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $140 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $125.  Let's meet in the middle, that's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget and I'm trying to be flexible. I'm willing to come down to $135. That's a fair compromise, and it's a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal.",135.0,Alice,5,
