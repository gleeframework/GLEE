Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value, I'm asking for $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,750,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,550,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can still secure a better price.  Rejecting allows me to counter-offer and potentially increase the price. Selling to John now would be settling for the minimum, and I'm aiming for a higher return."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,550,000 is still a bit below my expectations. I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000, which reflects a significant discount from my initial offer. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1650000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,650,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,600,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal. Let's reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum of $1,500,000 and allows me to secure a deal without risking further negotiation and potentially ending up with a lower price or having to sell to John."
