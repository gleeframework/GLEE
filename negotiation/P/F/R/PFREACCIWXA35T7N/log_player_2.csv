"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. It makes sense to reject this offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it, which is a fair price considering my needs. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $800,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still interested in selling the product to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get the price closer to his target."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still beyond my budget. Let's meet in the middle at $900,000. This price reflects a substantial discount for you and allows me to acquire the product within my financial limitations."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that should meet both of our needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. While the negotiations are progressing, continuing to bargain may take more time and effort.  Since John offers the product for Bob's desired price, it's more efficient and advantageous to buy from John at this point."
