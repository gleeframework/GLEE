Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so we need to offer a price higher than that to entice him.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,350,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation while still staying significantly above Bob's valuation. 
* **Strong Alternative:** We have a strong alternative buyer (John) willing to pay our minimum price, giving us a strong bargaining position.
* **Confident Messaging:** The message emphasizes the product's value and the exclusivity of the offer, aiming to persuade Bob.

This strategy attempts to secure a price significantly higher than Bob's valuation while leaving open the option to negotiate down slightly if needed.  Our strong alternative buyer gives us leverage in this situation."
