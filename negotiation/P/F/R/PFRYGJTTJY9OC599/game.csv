"I understand that you're looking for a compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $950000 is enough to justify the product's value. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm not leaving money on the table. My next counteroffer is $980000. I believe this price is a reasonable compromise, and I'm willing to meet you at this point. What do you think?",980000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to find a balance, Bob. However, I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to be confident that it's worth it. My next counteroffer is $980000, but I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium support package and a 10% discount on any future purchases. What do you think?",980000.0,Alice,9,
