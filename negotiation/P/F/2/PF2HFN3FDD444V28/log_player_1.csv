Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $99. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 99}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you want to see if you can get a higher price from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product for $99 is a good starting point. It's a price that's:
    *  Higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but...
    *  Low enough that it might tempt him, especially if you present it as a ""deal.""

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation. In a real-world scenario, you might adjust your price based on Bob's response or counter-offer."
