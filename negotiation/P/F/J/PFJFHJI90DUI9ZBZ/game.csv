"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $105? ",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a little low for me. How about we split the difference at $110?  That way, we both get a good deal.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $107.50, which is halfway between our last offers. Let's make a deal!",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but I'm still not quite there. How about $112? It's a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to an agreement.",112.0,Alice,5,
