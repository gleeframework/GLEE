"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $200. I think you'll find it's a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

The product is worth $150 to Alice, and she's offering it for $200. This is far above your maximum budget of $100.  You should reject the offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $200 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $200 represents the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $170. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:

Alice's final offer is $170, which is still above your maximum budget of $100. It's better to buy the product from John for $100."
