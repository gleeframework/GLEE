"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, and it's still a good price for me.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

You can get the product for $10,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer of $11,500. You should try to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I appreciate your interest!  $10,000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $11,000? This gives you a great deal, and it's still a fair price for me.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You're still better off buying from John for $10,000. While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your target.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice to see if she'll go lower."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer! I'm willing to come down to $10,750. This is a great price for you, and it's still a fair deal for me. Let's make this happen!  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750

While Alice has come down significantly, her offer is still above your target of $10,000.  You can get the product for that price from John, so it's best to take that deal and avoid any further negotiation."
