Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while still exceeding your minimum ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $119 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's particularly eager, but still ensures you make a profit.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $120."
