Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase [product name]. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly exceptional."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" to justify the high price, framing it as an investment rather than just a purchase.
* **""Unique Opportunity""**:  This phrasing creates a sense of scarcity and exclusivity, making the offer more enticing. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  While you know Bob values the product at $1,500,000, he doesn't know you have a guaranteed buyer. Gauge his reactions and be prepared to negotiate if the initial offer is too high. 
* **Relationship Building:** Even if Bob rejects the first offer, maintaining a positive relationship is important if you want to continue negotiations."
