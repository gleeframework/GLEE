"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I understand the value of the product, I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $900,000? I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to find a fair deal, the $900,000 price point doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  Could you consider a price of $1,050,000? I believe this would be a win-win, allowing you to benefit from its value while still providing me with a fair return.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I appreciate your perspective on the value of the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,050,000 price point. Would it be possible for you to reconsider and offer a price closer to my maximum of $900,000? I'm hopeful for a mutually beneficial outcome.",900000.0,Bob,4,
