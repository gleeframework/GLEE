Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Situation**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $10,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $12,000 to Bob.
* **Your Backup:** You have a guaranteed sale to John for $10,000.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, so aiming for a price between $10,000 and $12,000 is ideal. Since you have a backup offer, you can afford to be a bit more ambitious. 

**Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for a special price of $11,500. I believe it offers significant value at this price, and I'm confident you'll be very satisfied with it."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** $11,500 is closer to Bob's perceived value, maximizing your potential profit.
* **Confident Language:**  Using phrases like ""special price"" and ""confident you'll be satisfied"" adds a touch of exclusivity and encourages a positive response. 

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob tends to negotiate hard, you might start slightly lower (e.g., $11,000) to leave room for bargaining.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial, you might consider a slightly lower price for long-term goodwill.

**Remember, this is just one strategy.  The best approach depends on your negotiation style and any additional information you might have about Bob.**"
