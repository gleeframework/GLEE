"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  This strategy aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  If Bob is truly interested, he might be willing to negotiate from this starting point.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** I have a significant buffer to work with if Bob counteroffers.
* **Minimize the risk of selling to John:**  While I'm willing to sell to John for $1,000,000, I prefer to get a higher price if possible.

I'll observe Bob's response and adapt my strategy accordingly in the next round."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is a decent price, I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price.  

* **Reasoning:** Bob's offer shows he's willing to pay more than John, which is encouraging. However, I want to see if I can push for a higher price, potentially closer to my initial $1,500,000. 
* **Next Steps:** I'll counteroffer with a price slightly lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's. This will allow for further negotiation without risking losing the deal completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering at $1,400,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. 

* **Reasoning:** This price is still higher than Bob's offer but shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Strategy:** I'm aiming to meet Bob halfway and see if he's willing to bridge the gap. If he accepts, I'll have secured a good price. If he rejects, I can adjust my counteroffer in the next round based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied.  

* **Reasoning:**  Bob's offer is just $100,000 above what I can get from John.  I'm still willing to negotiate, hoping to get closer to my initial target.
* **Next Steps:**  I'll counteroffer with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my previous counteroffer.  This shows continued flexibility and keeps the negotiation moving."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering at $1,250,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's last offer. 

* **Reasoning:** I'm trying to bridge the gap and see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway.  This price is still significantly higher than what I can get from John, making it a worthwhile negotiation.
* **Strategy:** This counteroffer shows my willingness to negotiate further but also sets a firm lower limit for my acceptable price. If Bob rejects this offer, I might start considering selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is my absolute minimum, but I've already spent several rounds trying to negotiate a higher price.  At this point, I'm running out of time and don't want to risk getting stuck with a price I'm not satisfied with. 

* **Reasoning:** John is willing to pay my minimum, and I've already established that Bob is likely to continue offering the minimum price.  There's no guarantee that I can get a higher price from Bob in the remaining rounds. 
* **Decision:**  Selling to John ensures I get my minimum price, while also guaranteeing a quick and secure sale.  While I'd prefer a higher price, I'm not willing to gamble with the remaining time."
