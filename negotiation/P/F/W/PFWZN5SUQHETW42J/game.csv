"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a competitive price, considering the value it brings to your business.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a little too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway Alice. How about we settle at $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're getting close to the price you're willing to pay, but I'm still not comfortable going below $8,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I can offer it to you for $8,200. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",8200.0,Alice,5,
