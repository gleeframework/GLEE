"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is way over his budget, and he can get the same product from John for $12,000.  It makes sense to try to negotiate with Alice, but if that fails, he has a solid alternative."

{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $18,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm very interested in this product, though, and I'm willing to pay $13,000. This is the absolute highest I can go."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $13,000 is the highest you're willing to pay, but I was thinking more along the lines of $16,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $16,000 is closer to his budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. He can get the product for less from John, so there's no reason to accept this offer.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice, but he should be prepared to walk away if her price doesn't get closer to his target."

{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate you coming down to $16,000, but I'm still a bit too far apart. I can't go higher than $14,000, and if you're not willing to go that low, I'll have to consider my other options."", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $16,000 and $14,000, which would be $15,000. I think that's a fair price for this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000.

While $15,000 is tempting, Bob has a solid alternative in John.  He's already said that he can't go higher than $14,000, and it's unlikely Alice will budge further.  To save money, Bob should go with John and buy the product for $12,000."
