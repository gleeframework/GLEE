"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $18,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm very interested in this product, though, and I'm willing to pay $13,000. This is the absolute highest I can go.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $13,000 is the highest you're willing to pay, but I was thinking more along the lines of $16,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate you coming down to $16,000, but I'm still a bit too far apart. I can't go higher than $14,000, and if you're not willing to go that low, I'll have to consider my other options.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $16,000 and $14,000, which would be $15,000. I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",15000.0,Alice,5,
