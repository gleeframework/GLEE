"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your starting price is quite a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table.  However, $1,300,000  doesn't quite reflect the true value and potential of this product.  To move forward, I would need to see an offer closer to $1,800,000.  This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I understand your position, $1,800,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and reflects a genuine desire to reach an agreement.  Let's try to find a middle ground.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. I've given this some thought, and in the spirit of compromise, I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is my final offer. It represents a significant discount from my initial asking price and reflects my desire to see this deal done.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,550,000 is still above my limit.  I'm prepared to pay $1,400,000, which is a fair reflection of the product's value to me.  Let's make this happen. I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
