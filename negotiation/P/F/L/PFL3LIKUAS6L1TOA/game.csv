"I appreciate your interest, Bob. While $95 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $102?",102.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $102 is closer, but I'm still a bit tight on budget. How about $98? It's a fair compromise, and we can close the deal.",98.0,Bob,4,
