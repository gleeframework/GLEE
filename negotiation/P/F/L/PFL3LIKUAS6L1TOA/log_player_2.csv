"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product. I think it would be perfect for you, and I'm asking for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
You're trying to get the best deal, and $110 is still too high.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $95? "", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. While $95 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $102? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $102 is closer to your desired price, there's still room for negotiation. You can try to get it lower by making another counteroffer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $102 is closer, but I'm still a bit tight on budget. How about $98? It's a fair compromise, and we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 98}
