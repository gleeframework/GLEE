"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own a one-of-a-kind item that will bring you a lot of value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $10,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept a higher price.  It makes sense to counteroffer Alice and try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value it will bring to you, and it's a compromise from my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. Alice's offer of $11,000 is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay, and he knows he can get the product for his target price of $10,000 from John. There's no need to continue negotiating with Alice at this point."
