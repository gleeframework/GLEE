"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $800000 is lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to compromise slightly. How about we split the difference and settle on $1000000? This price reflects the true value of the product and would allow us both to walk away happy.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
