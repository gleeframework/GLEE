{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate.  I'm willing to let it go for $10,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a bit above Bob's perceived value, but it gives room for negotiation. It also doesn't immediately make me lose money, which is important considering the alternative buyer, John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I want and what John is willing to pay. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250?  That's still a great deal for you and allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking to make a fair profit, but $9,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $9,000, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer more, $9,000 is a fair price and it's close enough to my desired price point.  I don't want to risk losing Bob completely and ending up selling to John for less than my minimum."
