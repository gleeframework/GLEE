"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $12,000. This is well above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's initial interest and see if he's willing to play ball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm going to reject it and see if I can get him to come up a bit.  $9,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $10,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it's a more reasonable compromise than his initial offer. I'm hoping he'll see this as a fair price and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd like to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to my ideal price, Bob's offer of $8,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price. It's also higher than what John is offering.  I don't want to risk losing this deal and ending up with less than I could have gotten."
