"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, giving me some room to negotiate. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play ball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $12,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still above my minimum. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob and avoid having to sell to John for a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$9,500 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my target.  I'm also considering the potential of selling to John, but I'll keep negotiating with Bob for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm going to lower my counteroffer to $11,000. I'm hoping this will be enticing enough for Bob to accept, but I'm still holding firm on a price that's above my minimum.  I'm running out of rounds and don't want to be forced to sell to John for a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a tricky situation.  $10,500 is above my minimum, but only slightly above what I'd get from John. However, we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  If I reject Bob's offer, I risk ending up with nothing or being forced to sell to John.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
