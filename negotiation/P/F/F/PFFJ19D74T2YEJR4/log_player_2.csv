# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing the details further.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $1,500,000 to me, and Alice is offering it to me for $2,250,000, which is too high. I'll look for a better deal.
