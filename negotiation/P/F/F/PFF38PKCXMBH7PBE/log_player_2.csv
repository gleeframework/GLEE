"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay up to $120 for the product.
* Alice's offer is $95, which is better than John's price of $120 but not the best possible deal.
* It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice values the product at $80.
* Offering $85 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, leaving some room for compromise. 
* It's a significant price reduction from Alice's original offer of $95 and still within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer of $90 is still lower than John's price of $120 and within your budget of $120. 
* While you could try to negotiate further, there is a risk that Alice will reject your offer again, and you might end up paying John's higher price. 
* Accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product at a reasonable price without risking a longer negotiation."
