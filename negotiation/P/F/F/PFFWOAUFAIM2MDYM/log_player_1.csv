Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value, I'm looking to pay closer to $85.  Let me know if that's something you'd consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $85 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price point of $95. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $87.50 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a price closer to $90. I believe I can get a better deal if I continue negotiating with Bob. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for the best deal. While I appreciate your offer, I'm not quite ready to drop below $88.
