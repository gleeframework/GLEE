"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $950,000, reflecting the value I know this product will bring to your business. Let's find a price that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the value the product will bring to my business.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  $925,000 is a good starting point, but I'm going to need to see a bit more to make this deal work.  How about we split the difference and settle on $937,500? I truly believe this product will be a major asset for your company, and this price is fair considering its value.",937500.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable going above $925,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $912,500. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the value the product will bring to my business.",912500.0,Bob,6,
