{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You are willing to pay up to $15,000, but Alice is asking for $14,000. 
* **There is room for negotiation.** You can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer. 
* **Buying from John is a backup option.**  You can always choose to buy from John if you can't reach an agreement with Alice."
