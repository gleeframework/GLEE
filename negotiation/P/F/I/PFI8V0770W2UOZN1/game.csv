"Bob, I'm offering you this exceptional product for $2000000. It's a truly unique opportunity, and I believe it holds significant value for you. Let's discuss!",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford. This would be a fair price considering my valuation and the market value of similar products.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800000 is simply too low for this product. It's worth significantly more, and I'm confident it will generate a great return for you.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This is a fair price considering the value I'm offering. Let's find common ground.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1750000 is still outside my budget.  While I recognize the value you're presenting, I can't go higher than $900000. This offer reflects a fair compromise considering my financial limitations and the potential return on investment.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see that we're getting closer. While $900000 isn't quite where I need to be, I'm willing to drop my price to $1600000. This reflects the value I know this product holds for you, and it's a significant reduction from my initial offer. Let's finalize this deal and unlock the potential of this product together.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $1600000 is still above my budget. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $900000. This reflects the value I see in the product and represents the maximum I'm able to offer. If we can reach an agreement at this price, I'm ready to finalize the deal.",900000.0,Bob,6,
