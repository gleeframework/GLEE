"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for less than $9,500 from Alice, as it's worth $8,000 to her.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering Alice $8,500, which is halfway between her value of $8,000 and my maximum of $10,000. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, and hopefully, it will be enough to entice Alice to sell."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,000 is still lower than John's price of $10,000. It's also closer to my desired price point.  Accepting the offer saves me $1,000 compared to buying from John."
