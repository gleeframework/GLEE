"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $14,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price point, given its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 
The product is worth $15,000 to Bob.  He can save money by negotiating with Alice.  He has the upper hand since he is willing to pay more than Alice values the product.  The counteroffer will provide an opportunity to save more money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,500 is lower than I can go.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,250?

While $13,250 is a better price than John's, Bob can still potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice.  He has room to make a counteroffer and try to bring the price down further."
