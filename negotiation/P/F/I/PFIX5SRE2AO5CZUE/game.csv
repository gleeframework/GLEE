"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount considering its value to me, and it leaves room for both of us to benefit. I'm confident this is a fair price, but I'm open to negotiation if you have any concerns. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the discount, $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value you place on it. I'm eager to make this deal work, but I can't go any higher. Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still significantly below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, but that's my final offer. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. I hope we can reach a compromise.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $900,000, which is a significant amount for me and a reasonable compromise considering your initial asking price. This offer reflects my budget limitations, but also my desire to make this deal happen. I hope we can reach an agreement at this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $900,000 is still too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which reflects a significant compromise on my part. This offer is my final one. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to explore other options.  I'm hopeful we can find a mutually beneficial solution.",950000.0,Alice,5,
