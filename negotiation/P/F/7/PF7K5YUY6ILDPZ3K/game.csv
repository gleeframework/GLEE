"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your $95 offer. I would like to propose $90 as my maximum offer for the product.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort in trying to find a compromise.  $90 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $92, which is a fair price given the value of the product. If you're serious about getting this, I'm ready to finalize the deal.",92.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I've done my best to accommodate your needs while staying within my budget. Unfortunately, I cannot agree to $92. I propose $88 as my final offer for the product.",88.0,Bob,6,
