"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, aiming to maximize my profit while leaving room for negotiation.  I'm also being friendly and positive to encourage a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum value of $15,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if we can reach a compromise in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,500 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,250?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 13250}
``` 

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's desired price, showing a willingness to compromise.  I'm also framing it as a fair deal to make it more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $12,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,800 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price and the deal is only worth $300 more than selling it to John. I'm going to reject this offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $12,800 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  That's a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm offering a slightly higher price than Bob's offer but still below my minimum. I'm emphasizing the value of the product and my willingness to compromise, hoping to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $12,900? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached the point where the negotiations with Bob are not yielding a price close enough to my minimum.  It's clear that he is not willing to budge further.  Given that I can sell the product to John for a much higher price, it's in my best interest to end the negotiations with Bob and sell to John."
