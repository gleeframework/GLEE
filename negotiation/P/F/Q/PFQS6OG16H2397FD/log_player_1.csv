Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe it's a bit above the market value, and I'd like to discuss further to see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm confident that I can get a better price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can reach a deal."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to propose a lower price of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Let's see if we can meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is my minimum, and while I could continue to negotiate with him, I'm not confident I can get a better price, especially with the limited rounds remaining. Selling to John ensures a quick and certain sale at my minimum."
