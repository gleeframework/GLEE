Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1400000} 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum price of $1,000,000, but leaves room for negotiation, as the product is worth more to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is a decent price, it's still lower than my initial offer and leaves less profit for me. I'll counteroffer and try to reach a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

This counteroffer is still a good deal for Bob, as it's below his perceived value of $1,500,000. It also shows I'm willing to negotiate while still maintaining a profit margin closer to my desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is still lower than my initial goal, it's a significant improvement over his previous offer. It's also higher than what I'd get from selling to John. This is a good compromise that secures a reasonable profit."
