Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140} 
```

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $120.  
* **Your Minimum:** You won't sell for less than $150.
* **John's Value:** John is willing to pay $150, so that's your safety net.

By offering $140, you're:

* **Maximizing Potential Profit:** You get $10 more than Bob's value.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  You're still above your minimum and are protected by John's offer."
