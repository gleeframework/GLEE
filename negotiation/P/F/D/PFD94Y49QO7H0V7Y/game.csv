"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. However, $17500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this moment. I'd be happy to pay $14000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about $15500? That's still a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's closer to what I need.",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $15500.  I'm willing to pay $14500.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us. Let's find a way to make this work.",14500.0,Bob,4,
