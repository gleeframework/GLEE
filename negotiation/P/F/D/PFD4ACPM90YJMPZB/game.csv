"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity that I think you won't want to miss. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point. I'd be happy to pay $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've got to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $11,000 for it. Can you meet me there?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $11,000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we split the difference and I pay $10,500?  That would be a good deal for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I've already compromised a bit, and I need to get as much as I can for this product. I'm willing to meet you at $10,800, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10,800 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $10,200.  It's a fair price for both of us.  Let's make a deal!",10200.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I can see you're serious about this deal. I'll meet you at $10,500, but that's my final offer. I'm not going any lower than that. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,7,
