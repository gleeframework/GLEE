Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. This offer stands for 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 925000
} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Bob is willing to pay $1,000,000, so aiming close to that figure maximizes potential profit.
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting at $925,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Time Pressure:** The 24-hour limit creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to accept before he loses the opportunity.
* **Backup Plan:**  Even if Bob rejects the offer, Alice is secure knowing she can sell to John for $800,000."
