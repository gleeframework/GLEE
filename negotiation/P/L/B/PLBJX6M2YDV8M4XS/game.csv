"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm happy to pay $9,500 for the product.  It's a fair price considering its value to me, and it allows us both to make a deal.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $10,500.  That's a good middle ground for us both, and it gets the deal done.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit high for you, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500.
