"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. However, $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. I'm willing to negotiate, so let's meet in the middle. How about $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1,900,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, but I think that's the highest I can go. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
