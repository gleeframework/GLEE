"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $75? ",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $75 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we settle on $82?",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $82 is still a little high for me.  Let's try $78.  I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm not willing to go below $85. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. How about we meet at $84?",84.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's try $80. I think this is a fair price, and it will allow us to finalize the deal.  ",80.0,Bob,6,
