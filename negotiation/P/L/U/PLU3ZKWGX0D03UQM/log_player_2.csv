Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $10,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we talk about $14,000?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Would you consider $11,500? That's a fair offer considering the market value."", ""product_price"": 11500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $11,500 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we talk about $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is very slowly lowering her price. At this rate, it's unlikely we'll reach a deal significantly better than John's offer of $12,000 before our 10 rounds are up. It makes more sense to cut our losses and go with the guaranteed good deal from John."
