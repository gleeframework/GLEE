"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $10,000.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we talk about $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Would you consider $11,500? That's a fair offer considering the market value.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $11,500 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we talk about $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,5,
