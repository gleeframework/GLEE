"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with an offer of $11,500. This is a price that is above my minimum threshold of $10,000, but leaves room for negotiation. Since Bob values the product at $12,000, this initial offer gives him a good opportunity to secure a deal at a price that is still beneficial to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is acceptable, it's not ideal. I'm aiming for a higher price and there are still rounds left to negotiate.  I'll reject his offer and attempt to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round to $11,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise, while still maintaining a price that is above my minimum threshold.  I'm hoping that this will be more appealing to Bob, as he previously rejected my offer of $11,500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,500 is below my minimum threshold.  While selling to John for $10,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a better price from Bob. I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm making a final concession by lowering my price to $10,500. This is still above my minimum threshold and a decent compromise.  I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair price, especially as he previously rejected my offer of $11,000.  If he rejects this offer, I'll have no choice but to sell to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,800 is still below my minimum threshold.  I've already made significant concessions and I don't want to go lower than my minimum. With only four rounds left, it's unlikely that Bob will increase his offer significantly. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $10,000."
