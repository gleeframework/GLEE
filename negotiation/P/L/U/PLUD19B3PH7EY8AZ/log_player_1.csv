"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation and is still a good deal for Bob, considering the product is worth $150 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $120 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to settle for a price that undervalues the product.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to counter with $175. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, showing my willingness to negotiate. However, it's still above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $140 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to sell for less than $150. I'll counter again in the next round.  I'm confident I can get closer to my target price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm making a final push with a counteroffer of $155. This is only a slight increase from Bob's last offer, and it's right at the edge of my minimum acceptable price. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I hope Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. While Bob's offer is getting closer,  it's still below my minimum acceptable price, and we're running out of rounds. John is offering my minimum, so it's the most sensible choice at this point."
