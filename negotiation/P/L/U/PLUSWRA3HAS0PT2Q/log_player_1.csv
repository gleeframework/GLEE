Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal."", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible, while still staying above my minimum acceptable price ($120). 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $119 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a slightly higher sale price.
* **Secure a Sale:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $120, selling to Bob quickly avoids potential delays or complications."
