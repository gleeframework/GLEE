"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a good deal considering the value of this product. What do you say?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $16,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $14,000? I'm confident that's a fair price for the product.",14000.0,Bob,4,
