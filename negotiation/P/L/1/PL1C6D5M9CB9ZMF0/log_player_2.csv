"Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and secure a lower price. It's possible Alice is willing to go lower, and Bob can save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible. Offering $750,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and represents a substantial savings for Bob.  This counteroffer is aggressive, but it leaves room for potential negotiation should Alice counter.  Bob is prepared to walk away if Alice doesn't budge significantly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $775,000 is a good compromise.  It's a significant drop from her initial price and a considerable saving for Bob.  While further negotiation could potentially bring the price down further, the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer or Bob being forced to buy from John at $1,000,000 outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price.  Accepting Alice's offer is a good balance of cost savings and minimizing risk."
