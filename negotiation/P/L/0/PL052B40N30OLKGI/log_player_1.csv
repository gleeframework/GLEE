"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but it allows for maximum potential profit. If Bob rejects, I'll have room to negotiate downwards, and if he accepts, I've maximized my earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,800,000 is a good price, I believe we can still do better.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,900,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a good price."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I think I can still push for a higher price. We're halfway through the negotiation rounds, and I'm not desperate to close the deal yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1850000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,850,000. This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a good price. I'm hoping that this will be a good middle ground for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,650,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm not going to accept it just yet.  I believe that there's still room for negotiation. We are getting close to the end, but I'm going to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000.  This is a compromise, moving halfway towards Bob's offer. I'm hoping that this will be a good middle ground and encourage Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. With only two rounds left, I need to secure a deal.  While $1,600,000 isn't ideal, it's still above my minimum and ensures I make a profit.  There's a good chance that I won't be able to negotiate a better price in the next round, and I don't want to risk selling to John for the lower amount."
