Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price given your value and my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still confident I can get closer to $1,000,000. There's also a risk that Bob will keep lowering his offer if I accept. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit low. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $950,000 for the product. This is a great deal for both of us, allowing me to make a good profit while ensuring you get a valuable asset."", ""product_price"": 950000}
