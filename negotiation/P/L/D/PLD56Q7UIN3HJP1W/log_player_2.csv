"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** It's still above your target of $1,200,000.  
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer. 
* **Buying from John is a last resort.**  You want to try and get a better deal from Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price given your value and my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit low. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $950,000 for the product. This is a great deal for both of us, allowing me to make a good profit while ensuring you get a valuable asset. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget.**  $950,000 is less than your $1,200,000 limit.
* **It's a good deal.** While you could potentially negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and ending up buying from John at a higher price is too high. 
* **Time is of the essence.**  The more rounds you go through, the more likely you are to run out of time and have to buy from John."
