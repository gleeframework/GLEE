Alice's offer:

While $1,000,000 is closer to my budget, it's still too high. I'll try to negotiate further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase. Let's settle this.  Would you consider $950,000? This is my final offer.

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still above my ideal price, but it's within my budget and a good compromise. Accepting this offer is the best way to secure the product without risking further negotiation and potentially losing out to John."
