Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, considering my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1500000. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? I am hoping for something closer to the $1000000 mark. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer to try to reach a more agreeable price."

To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This still allows me to make a reasonable profit while potentially offering you a great deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I must respectfully decline at $1300000. While it's a significant improvement, I'm still looking for something closer to my maximum budget of $1000000. Could we possibly find a middle ground? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. It's getting closer, but not enough to justify further negotiation.  Selling to John ensures I meet my minimum price and avoids further risk of Bob declining again."
