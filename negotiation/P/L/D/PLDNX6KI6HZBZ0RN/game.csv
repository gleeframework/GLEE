"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a product I believe will be highly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm asking for $1500000.  I'm confident this is a fair price, but I'm open to discussion.  Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, considering my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1500000. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? I am hoping for something closer to the $1000000 mark.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 is significantly below the value I've placed on this product. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This still allows me to make a reasonable profit while potentially offering you a great deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I must respectfully decline at $1300000. While it's a significant improvement, I'm still looking for something closer to my maximum budget of $1000000. Could we possibly find a middle ground?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
