"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product but could only consider a price closer to $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle at $12,500? That feels like a fair compromise.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $16,000 is still a bit too high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,500. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $14,500. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",14500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I can do $13,000, but that's really pushing my limit.  Let me know if that works for you.",13000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $13,000. I'll make another compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $14,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",14000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, this is getting a bit frustrating.  I'm offering a fair price, but it seems like we're not making much progress.  My final offer is $13,250.  Take it or leave it.",13250.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're getting frustrated, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a final offer. However, I'm not willing to accept $13,250. I'll make one more compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $13,750. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",13750.0,Alice,9,
