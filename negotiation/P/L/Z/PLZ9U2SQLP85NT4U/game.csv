"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exclusive product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product,  $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000 for it, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a compromise on my end. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit out of my reach. I'm willing to go to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us and allows for a good margin for you.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to squeeze out some savings, Bob. I appreciate your persistence, but I need to be realistic about the product's value. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000, which is still a discount from my original offer. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can close the deal here.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,200,000 is still pushing my budget.  I'm prepared to go to $1,125,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",1125000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to think we're getting close to the point of no return. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,225,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope you can meet me here. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1225000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,225,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you at $1,175,000. This represents a significant compromise from my last offer and brings us closer to a mutually agreeable price.  I'm confident we can close this deal if we both work together to find common ground.",1175000.0,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the point where I need to consider other options. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,225,000 is too high, I will go to $1,200,000 is too low, so I will go to $1,212,500. This is a compromise that I am willing to make, and I hope you can meet me here.",1212500.0,Alice,9,

"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,212,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $1,190,000, which is a significant compromise from my last offer. This is my final offer, and I truly believe it's a fair price that allows us both to close this deal successfully.  Let's make it happen.",1190000.0,Bob,10,
