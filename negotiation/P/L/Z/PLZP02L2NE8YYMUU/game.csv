"Dear Bob, I am excited to present our flagship product, which I believe would significantly enhance your operations and productivity. Given its value to you, I understand it might be worth $8,000 to you. Considering its true worth and the investment we've made into developing it, I propose to sell it to you for $12,000. This price not only reflects the product's quality and potential benefits but also allows us to cover our costs and ensure future development. I look forward to hearing your response. Kind regards, Alice",12000.0,Alice,1,
