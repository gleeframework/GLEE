``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This is to give myself room to negotiate and hopefully secure a higher price. I'm also emphasizing the mutual benefit of the deal to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product is high, but I'm only able to pay up to $850,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to secure a higher price.  I believe there's room for us to meet in the middle."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I value your interest,  $850,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $875,000.

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I want to try to push for a higher price in the next round. I believe there's still room for us to meet in the middle."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm happy to meet you halfway, but $860,000 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to accept $865,000 for the product.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer, even though it's getting closer to my minimum price. I want to see if we can reach a deal closer to my target price in the next few rounds. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe we can still get a better price from Bob."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. Even though it's only $1,000 more than what John is offering, it's still a good deal. There's only one round left, and I'm not sure I can get a higher price from Bob. It's better to close the deal now and avoid the risk of losing the sale completely."
