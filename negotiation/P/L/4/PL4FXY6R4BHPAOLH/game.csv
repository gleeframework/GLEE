I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $1200000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable item at a discount from its true worth of $1500000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.,1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the discount, $1200000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire a valuable asset while providing you with a significant profit. I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1300000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the product's value while also being reasonable for you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a fair price, and I'm willing to compromise further.  However, $1300000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1100000 for the product. This price reflects the value of the product while providing you with a reasonable profit margin. I'm confident we can reach a final agreement at this price.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm counteroffering at $1250000. This price is a bit higher than your last offer, but it's still a compromise that I believe reflects the product's value and my minimum acceptable price.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
