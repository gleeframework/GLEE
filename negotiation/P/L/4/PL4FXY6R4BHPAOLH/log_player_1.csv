Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the discount, $1200000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire a valuable asset while providing you with a significant profit. I'm confident we can reach an agreement.
