"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

Since Alice's offer is at your maximum price point and John is also offering the product at the same price, it makes no sense to negotiate with Alice. Buying from John guarantees you the product at your desired price without any risk of further negotiation."
