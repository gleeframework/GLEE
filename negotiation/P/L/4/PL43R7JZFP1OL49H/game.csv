"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $8,500.  This product is worth $8,000 to you, and I'm willing to pay a fair premium for it. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. This still leaves you with a good deal, and it's closer to what I need. Let's make this happen!",9000.0,Alice,3,
