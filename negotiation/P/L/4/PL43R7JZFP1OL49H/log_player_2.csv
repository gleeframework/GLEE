"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your ideal price point. You can potentially get a better deal by counteroffering. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can reach a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $8,500.  This product is worth $8,000 to you, and I'm willing to pay a fair premium for it. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. This still leaves you with a good deal, and it's closer to what I need. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $9,000 is a good compromise. It's still within your budget and saves you $1,000 compared to buying from John.  Further negotiation might lead to a slightly lower price, but the risk of Alice rejecting and potentially needing to buy from John for $10,000 outweighs the potential savings."
