Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum value of $15,000, but it gives me some room to negotiate.  I'm hoping Bob values the product enough to meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for $12,000, which is below my minimum value. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $17,000. This is still above my minimum value of $15,000 but is closer to Bob's offer. Hopefully, this price is more appealing to him and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $15,000 is my minimum value. I'm not going to risk losing him as a buyer and potentially ending up with nothing.  It's better to take the sure thing and sell to Bob at his price."
