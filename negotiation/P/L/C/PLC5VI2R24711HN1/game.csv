"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. Can you consider that?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $1200000 is a good starting point, I need to consider the true value of what I'm offering.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to accept $1350000 for this unique opportunity.  This represents a significant value for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you. I'm also looking to find a fair deal. While $1250000 isn't quite where I need to be, I'm willing to come down a bit more.  Let's settle on $1300000.  This is a significant discount from my original offer and a good price for both of us.  What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
