Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down a bit, while still ensuring Alice gets a price significantly higher than her minimum.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** Offering it at $15,000 right away might make Bob feel like there's no room for discussion and could lead to an immediate rejection.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
