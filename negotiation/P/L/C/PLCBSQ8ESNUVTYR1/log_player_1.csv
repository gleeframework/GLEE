Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I believe this product is worth more.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000.  This allows for some room for negotiation, but it's still a fair price for its potential value."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

Round 4

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. Although it's getting closer to my minimum, I still believe the product is worth more, and I have time to negotiate further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

We've reached a point where further negotiation with Bob seems unlikely to yield a price higher than what John is offering.  It's time to cut our losses and take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
