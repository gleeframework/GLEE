Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.  He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's a potential agreement zone between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999. 

**Strategy**

You want to aim high, but leave Bob feeling like he got a reasonable deal.  Starting too high could make him walk away immediately.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth in the market."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You're confident about the product's value.
* **Justification:** Mentioning ""unique value"" and ""market worth"" subtly implies it could be worth more to Bob than he realizes.
* **Leaving Room:**  The $1,350,000 price gives you room to negotiate down slightly if Bob hesitates, while still staying above your minimum.

**Important Note:**  This is just one possible offer. You can adjust the price within the ZOPA based on your assessment of Bob's personality and negotiation style."
