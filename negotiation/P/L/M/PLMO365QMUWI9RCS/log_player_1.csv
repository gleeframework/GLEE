{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is slightly above Bob's perceived value, giving him an incentive to accept. However, it also leaves room for negotiation if he counteroffers, as I can still make a profit at a price lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, so I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $1,025,000? This would still be a great value for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,025,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm confident I can get that price from John, so I'll choose to sell to him and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
