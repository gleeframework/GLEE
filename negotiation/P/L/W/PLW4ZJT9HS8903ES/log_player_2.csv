{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to reject Alice's offer.  You can potentially get a better deal by counteroffering.  While John offers a guaranteed $100 price, it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
``` 

I'm offering $85. This is a fair price that's still within my budget and leaves room for Alice to make a profit."

You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer is higher than my initial counteroffer, but still above my desired price. I'll reject and counteroffer again, hoping to get closer to my target price."

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $87. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still trying to get a price that's closer to my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is getting increasingly higher, and the negotiations are becoming less appealing.  At this point, it's better to buy from John for $100.  I've reached a point where the potential savings by continuing to negotiate with Alice are not worth the effort."
