"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This is a good starting point because it gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.  It's also important to remember that I have a guaranteed sale with John for $15,000, so I can afford to be somewhat aggressive in my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $15,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting his offer, I can continue the conversation and try to get a higher price.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I'm hoping for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm offering $17,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the value I place on the product. I believe this is a reasonable price that could be acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $16,000 is a good compromise.  It's significantly more than John's offer, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely by continuing to negotiate."
