"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $11,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn more than selling to John.  I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $12,000, so I don't need to settle for anything less than that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,500 is better than my minimum of $12,000, I believe there is still room for negotiation. I'm confident I can get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm offering $10,500. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer. I hope this will entice Bob to accept, as it's still significantly more than his perceived value but lower than my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,000 is approaching my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired $12,000, especially since I have the option of selling to John.  I'm also not sure if Bob is willing to go any higher, so I'm prepared to risk losing him to see if he'll come up in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm offering $10,000. This is a lower counter-offer than my previous one, but it still puts me closer to my desired price point of $12,000. I'm also hoping that Bob will see this as a sign that I'm serious about getting a deal done, and that he will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10250}
```

I'm offering $10,250.  This is a small compromise, but it shows I'm willing to be flexible and potentially close the deal.  If Bob is serious about getting the product, this might be the offer he accepts.  I'm still closer to my goal of $12,000 than selling to John, but the clock is ticking and I need to be strategic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John.  Bob's offer of $9,200 is too far below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I have only two rounds remaining, and it's unlikely that Bob will come up to a price that I'm satisfied with.  It's better to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John rather than risk getting nothing or a significantly lower price from Bob."
