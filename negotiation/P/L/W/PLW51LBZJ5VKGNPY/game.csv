"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate you meeting me halfway, the price is still a bit high for me. Could you do $760,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",760000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, I understand that $825,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $760,000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm counteroffering at $795,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",795000.0,Alice,5,
