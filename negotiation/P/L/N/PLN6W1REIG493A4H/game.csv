"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has tremendous value and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. This price is still fair for both of us, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $850,000, which I believe is still a great deal for both of us. It's a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $850,000 is still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $700,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value and my budget. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $800,000, which is my minimum target. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it.

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to come down in price.  However, $800,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $750,000. This price is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,6,
