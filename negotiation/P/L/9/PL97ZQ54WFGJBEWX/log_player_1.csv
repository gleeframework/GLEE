Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring you."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This maximizes your potential profit.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""value and potential"" of the product helps justify the higher price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is high, it leaves some room for Bob to negotiate down if he finds it too steep. 
 
**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. You could potentially start with an even higher offer depending on your risk tolerance and your assessment of Bob's eagerness to acquire the product."
