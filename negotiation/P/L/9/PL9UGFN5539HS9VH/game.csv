"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a fantastic deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll love it!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This would be a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can make this happen.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  Let's split the difference and aim for $1,200,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can make it work.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your persistence, Bob! I understand that $1,200,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,250,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
