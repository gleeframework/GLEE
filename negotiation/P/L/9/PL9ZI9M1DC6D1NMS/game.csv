"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000.  I'm confident it can greatly benefit you, and this price reflects its true worth.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is quite a bit higher than I had in mind.  I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000 for the product.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly below its value.  To move this forward, I can come down to $19,000. I believe this price represents a fair deal considering the benefits it offers.",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working on the price.  I'm getting closer, but $19,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you consider $11,000? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, it seems like we are getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $11,000 is still lower than I'd like, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $15,000. This is my final offer, as it already matches what other buyers are offering.",15000.0,Alice,5,
