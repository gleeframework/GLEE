"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1100000} 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly above what the product is worth to Bob. This is a good starting point as it allows for negotiation. It also shows that I am confident in the value of my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I will reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating to try and reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $950,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate but still maintaining a price that's closer to my desired value. It's likely that Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a better price. While Bob's offer is getting lower, it's still not within my acceptable range. I'll continue to negotiate with him, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

Since Bob has been steadily lowering his offer, I'm willing to meet him halfway at $900,000. This shows that I'm flexible and willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is getting a bit too low for me. While I want to make a deal, I'm not going to significantly lower my price anymore. I value the product at $1,000,000, and that's what John is willing to pay.  It's time to move on and accept John's offer."
