"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $8,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate you reaching out, but $18,000 is far too high for me. Considering the value to me, I'm only willing to pay $8,000. Let me know if you're open to discussing that.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $8,000. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to come down, $12,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $8,000. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $8,000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value I place on the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10000.0,Alice,5,
