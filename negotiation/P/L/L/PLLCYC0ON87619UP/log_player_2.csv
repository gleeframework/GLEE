"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 
Alice's offer is still significantly higher than her product valuation. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,500?"",
""product_price"": 8500
}
``` 

This counter-offer aims to bring the price closer to Alice's valuation while still leaving some room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to come down a bit, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $9,250? This would still be a great deal for you, as the product is worth $12,000 to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, we're not in a hurry. It's likely we can get the price closer to $8,000 if we continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $9,250 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we try $8,750? "",
""product_price"": 8750
}
``` 

We're moving in smaller increments now to signal that we're serious about getting a good price, but we're still aiming for something closer to Alice's valuation."
