"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $20,000 is a bit too high for me, but I am interested. How about $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest! While $12,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm happy to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $17,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something a bit lower.  Would you consider $13,500?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, it seems like we're getting closer! $13,500 is still a bit low for me considering the value this product offers. How about we settle at $15,500? This would be a fair compromise.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, you're right, we're getting close!  I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit, but $15,500 is still a little high for me.  Would you consider $14,000?  That's a fair offer considering John is offering me the same product for $15,000.",14000.0,Bob,6,
