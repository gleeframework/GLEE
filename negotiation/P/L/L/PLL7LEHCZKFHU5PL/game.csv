"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to part with it for $900,000. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself!",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $700,000 is still a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $800,000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $800,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to find a little more wiggle room in the budget. How about we settle at $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a fair compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still a bit short on the price. I'm willing to give you a slight concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $820,000? It's a good compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price. What do you think?",820000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close! I can feel it.  I'm willing to bump my offer to $780,000.  That's a significant jump from my previous offer, and shows how serious I am about purchasing this product.",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to bump up the offer, and I'm glad to see we're getting closer. However, I still need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about we meet at $810,000? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price. What do you think?",810000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is my final offer.  I'm willing to pay $790,000.  This is a very fair price, and I need a decision from you quickly.  I'm running out of time and other options are becoming more appealing.",790000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're running out of time, but I'm not willing to give up on this deal just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession to get this deal done. How about we meet at $815,000? It's still a bit above my target price, but I'm willing to make an exception for you. What do you think?",815000.0,Alice,9,
