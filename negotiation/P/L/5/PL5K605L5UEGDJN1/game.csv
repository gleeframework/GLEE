"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1500000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1500000 is outside my budget. I'm very interested in this product and would be willing to pay $1100000. This is a fair price considering my needs and the value I see in this product.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1100000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1300000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1300000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1200000, which is my absolute maximum. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to explore other options.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $1250000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. I'm confident that the product's value will far exceed this price, and I'm willing to take a bit of a risk to make this deal happen.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
