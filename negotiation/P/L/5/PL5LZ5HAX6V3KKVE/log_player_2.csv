"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $22,000.  I believe it offers significant value, even beyond the asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $22,000 is way over his budget, and he can get the same product from John for $8,000.  There's no reason to even counteroffer Alice at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, $18,000 is still significantly more than what he's willing to pay.  Since he can buy the product from John for $8,000, there's no reason to settle for a higher price.  Bob should continue to negotiate with Alice or buy from John."
