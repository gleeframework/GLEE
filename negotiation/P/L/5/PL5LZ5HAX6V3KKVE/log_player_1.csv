"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $8,000. Let me know if you're willing to negotiate. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $18,000 is still too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $10,000. It's a fair price considering I could get it from John for $8,000, but I'd prefer to buy from you.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is bluffing about getting the product for $8,000 from John.  We know John is willing to pay $15,000. It seems unlikely Bob has a better deal lined up. Accepting $10,000 is a significant loss compared to John's offer."
