"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a good profit, while also leaving the option to sell to John if the negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, I'm still hoping to get more. I'll reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

I'm countering with a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now very close to what I know the product is worth to him.  It's getting late in the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for a lower price."
