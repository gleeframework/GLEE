"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll get a lot of value out of it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob:**  Alice is selling the product for $130, which is less than the $150 Bob would pay John.
* **Bob's goal is to save money:** Accepting Alice's offer means saving $20 compared to buying from John."
