"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, she's likely to be willing to negotiate a bit lower to make a profit. Rejecting her offer gives you leverage to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  A counteroffer of $1,000,000 is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but it's still within a range where she could potentially make a profit.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer allows me to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. If she's flexible, she'll likely counter with a price closer to my offer. If she's firm, I'll know I need to adjust my strategy."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **A good compromise:** $1,300,000 is a good middle ground between my previous counteroffer of $1,000,000 and Alice's previous offer of $1,200,000. 
* **Saving money:**  Accepting this offer saves me $200,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Limited negotiation room:**  While I could potentially try to negotiate further, Alice is likely becoming more firm in her price. It's unlikely I'll get a significantly better deal."
