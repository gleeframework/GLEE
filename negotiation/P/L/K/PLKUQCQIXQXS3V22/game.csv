"I'm interested in the product, but $999000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $950000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's potential benefits. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $950000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway as well. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $975000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $975000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $980000, but I'd like to see if we can meet somewhere in between. I'll make a counteroffer of $970000. Can you consider this price?",970000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to consider your counteroffer of $970000. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. I'll meet you halfway again and offer you a price of $992500. This is a compromise that I'm willing to make to reach an agreement. What do you think?",992500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $992500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one more attempt to reach an agreement. I'll make a counteroffer of $985000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",985000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you've made a final offer, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $985000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'll offer you a price of $998000. This is as close as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.
