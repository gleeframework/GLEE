Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers. Let me know your thoughts and if you have any questions."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price closer to your minimum ($1,500,000) sets a high anchor. While $1,500,000 might scare Bob off, $1,300,000 leaves room for negotiation (if needed) while still aiming high.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message focuses on the product's ""unique value"" and ""significant benefits"" to justify the high price and potentially sway Bob. 
* **John as Leverage:**  While not explicitly mentioned, knowing you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 gives you a strong position. You don't *need* to go below that price.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. However, having John as a backup buyer allows you to confidently hold firm if Bob's offers are too low."
