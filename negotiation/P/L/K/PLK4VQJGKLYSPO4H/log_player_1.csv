"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be perfect for you.  I'm offering it to you for $140.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $140, knowing that the product is worth $150 to Bob, giving him room to negotiate. 
* **Showing interest:** I'm emphasizing the potential value of the product for Bob to encourage him to accept.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This allows for potential counteroffers without immediately triggering a move to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, thanks for the offer.  $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $125?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $125 is better than John's offer of $100, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Negotiation is key:**  I believe there's room to negotiate further and get closer to my desired price.  Rejecting Bob's offer gives me the opportunity to counter and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $135. This is still a great deal for you, and it's the lowest I can go. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering a lower price than my initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm emphasizing that $135 is still a great deal for Bob, reminding him of the product's value to him.
* **Setting a limit:**  I'm stating that $135 is my bottom line, putting pressure on Bob to accept or risk losing the opportunity."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $135 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. How about $130?  It's a fair price, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting closer:** Bob's offer of $130 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100 and only $5 away from my last counteroffer.
* **Time is ticking:** We're nearing the halfway point of our negotiations, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely. 
* **Potential for future deals:**  Even though $130 isn't my ideal price, accepting this offer allows me to secure a sale and potentially build a relationship with Bob for future transactions."
