Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I think it would be a great deal for you!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $120 as possible since that's what John will pay.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While I want a price close to my minimum, starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, increasing my profit. 
* **Beat Bob's Value:**  Bob values the product at $100, so offering it below that is pointless.  By offering it at $119, I'm still giving myself the best chance to get a higher price than his perceived value.

It's a delicate balance between getting the best price from Bob and ensuring I don't lose the sale to John."
