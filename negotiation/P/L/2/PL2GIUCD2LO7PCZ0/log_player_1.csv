* **Plan B:**  I have John as a backup option, which allows me to be assertive in negotiations without being overly desperate."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.
