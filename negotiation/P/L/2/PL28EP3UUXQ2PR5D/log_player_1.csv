Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a steal at $145. I think you'll find it's a great value at this price."",
""product_price"": 145
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** The product is only worth $120 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $150. 
* **John's Offer:** You have a guaranteed offer for $150 from John.

Therefore, you need to offer a price that is enticing to Bob (lower than his perceived value) but still higher than your minimum. Offering it at $145 leaves room for Bob to potentially accept while still netting you a profit. If Bob rejects the offer, you're no worse off, as you can sell it to John for your desired price."
