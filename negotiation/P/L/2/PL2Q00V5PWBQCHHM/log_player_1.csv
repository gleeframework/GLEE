Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $115."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $120 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $115 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate but is still a great price for you.
* **Higher than John's Offer:** It's crucial that the offer is more appealing than John's $100 offer, ensuring you get the best possible price."
