"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",1750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $1,200,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This is a significant compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,400,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Can we try $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to be reasonable, but $1,300,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,350,000 as a final offer. This is the absolute lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target price. Can we try $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're going in circles.  While I appreciate your persistence, $1,225,000 is simply too far below what I need to accept.  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us. I'm willing to go down to $1,300,000 one last time. If this isn't acceptable, I may have to consider other options.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close to the end of our negotiations, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time, but I need to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible. Can we try $1,275,000?",1275000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm honestly getting frustrated with this back and forth. We're both being stubborn, and I'm worried we're not going to be able to come to an agreement.  I'm going to make one final offer at $1,287,500. This is the absolute lowest I can go. If you're not willing to accept this, I'm going to have to move on to other options.",1287500.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're frustrated, but I'm not willing to pay $1,287,500. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, which is my absolute maximum. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to consider other options, including buying from John for $800,000.",1200000.0,Bob,10,
