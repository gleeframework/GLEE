"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is great, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,000. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. This product offers tremendous value, and I believe a price of $17,000 is fair. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price. To move this forward, I'd be willing to come down to $15,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest price I can accept for this product.",15000.0,Alice,5,
