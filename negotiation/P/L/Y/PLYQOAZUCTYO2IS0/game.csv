"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. This is a great deal, considering its value and uniqueness.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Can you consider meeting me in the middle at $12500?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, I'm not comfortable going all the way down to $12500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your counteroffer, so I'll propose a new price of $13750. This is still a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",13750.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $13750 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a price of $11000. I'm confident that this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it if we can meet on this price.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I'm not comfortable going below $13000. I'll propose a new price of $13200. This is still a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",13200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but $13200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13200 and my last offer of $11000, which would be $12100. I'm hoping we can meet on this price.",12100.0,Bob,6,
