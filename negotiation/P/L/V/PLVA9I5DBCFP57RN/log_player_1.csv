Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, keeping in mind Alice's goals:

```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it's worth a great deal due to its unique value. I'm proposing a price of $15,000. I think you'll find this a fair offer considering its potential. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim High:**  Since Alice knows Bob values the product at $12,000 and she has a guaranteed sale at that price to John, she has room to negotiate. Starting at $15,000 gives her a buffer.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning ""unique value"" and ""potential"" subtly reinforces the product's worth, making the higher price seem more reasonable.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone is not demanding but rather invites a discussion, making Bob more likely to counter-offer instead of outright rejecting the initial price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Market Research:** While this response offers a good starting point, Alice would benefit from researching if similar products have sold for more than $12,000.  This would strengthen her negotiating position.
* **Relationship:** If Alice wants to build a long-term relationship with Bob, she might be slightly less aggressive with the markup."
