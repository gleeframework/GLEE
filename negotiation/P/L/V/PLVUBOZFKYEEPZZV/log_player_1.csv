"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know will be extremely valuable to your business. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000.  It's a great price considering its true worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Highlighting Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, hoping to pique his interest and make him consider the price. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  By starting high, I have room to negotiate without dropping below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. This also leaves open the possibility of a counteroffer from Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** Depending on Bob's response, I'll adjust my strategy for the next round. 
* **John's Offer:** I'll keep John's offer of $1,000,000 in mind as a safety net if the negotiation with Bob stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think the price is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price. I believe I can get closer to my target.
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's still room for negotiation.  I can likely get a better price than $900,000.
* **John's Offer:**  Although John is offering $1,000,000, I haven't exhausted all my options with Bob yet. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** In the next round, I will send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to be closer to my asking price to make this work. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still reflects the value of the product for your business, and it gives us both a good deal. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000, which is still significantly higher than Bob's offer but closer to my ideal price.  
* **Maintaining Value:** The message reiterates the value of the product for Bob's business to keep him engaged. 
* **Finality:**  I'm using language like ""make this happen"" to subtly signal that this might be my final concession.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** I'll carefully consider Bob's response and decide whether to accept his offer, make another counteroffer, or sell to John if he rejects my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking to make a profit, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my target. 
* **Negotiation Room:** I believe there's still room to get closer to my desired price.
* **John's Offer:**  Although John is offering $1,000,000, I'm still willing to negotiate with Bob to see if I can get a better deal. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** In the next round, I will send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000.  I might propose a compromise like $975,000 to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down to $975,000.  That's a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's close this deal and get you the product you need. "", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise price of $975,000. This is closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive tone, emphasizing a ""good deal"" for both parties, hoping to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Urgency:**  I'm subtly adding a sense of urgency by suggesting we ""close this deal.""

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** I'll closely watch Bob's response.  If he rejects this offer, I will need to seriously consider selling to John, as my negotiation room is shrinking."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $925,000 for the product. Can we meet in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:** Bob's offer of $925,000 is getting too close to my minimum, and I'm not confident I can get a better price.  
* **Time Running Out:**  We're approaching the halfway point in the negotiation rounds.  Continuing to haggle with Bob might mean losing time and potentially a better deal with John. 
* **John's Offer:** John is offering a guaranteed $1,000,000.  This is a safe and reliable option, given the uncertainty of the negotiation with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Sell to John:**  Since I'm not confident of reaching my ideal price with Bob, I'll take John's offer to guarantee a sale at a price that meets my minimum requirement."
