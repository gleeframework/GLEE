**Explanation:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process.  By offering a significantly lower price, I aim to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. If she's willing to budge, I'll adjust my offers based on her responses.  If not, I can always move on to John."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is now within my budget, it's still too high. There's still potential to negotiate a lower price, especially since I'm willing to pay John's price as a last resort.  I'm aiming to get as close to $1,000,000 as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1020000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm getting closer to my goal of $1,000,000. This offer is still within my budget but represents a significant reduction from Alice's latest proposal.  I'm hoping she'll see that we're getting close to a deal and accept this offer."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my target price, it's still $60,000 more than what I can get from John.  At this point, I've already negotiated several rounds and it's likely Alice won't budge further.  It's more efficient to accept John's offer and save myself further negotiation time and potential for more rejected counteroffers."
