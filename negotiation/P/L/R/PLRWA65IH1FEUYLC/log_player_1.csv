Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this product. However, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Considering the value I see in this product, I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
