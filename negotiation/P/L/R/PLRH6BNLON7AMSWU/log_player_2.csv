Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you considering my offer and providing your perspective. While I recognize there's a gap between our valuations, I believe $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential and the benefits it offers. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I'm confident this price reflects the product's inherent value while still offering you a significant return on your investment.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. To be transparent, my absolute minimum for this product is $1,500,000. This is a firm number, and I'm unable to go any lower. I believe it's a fair offer considering the product's potential and the value it brings. I'm open to hearing your thoughts on this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice revealed her bottom line:**  She stated her absolute minimum is $1,500,000. 
* **You have a better alternative:** You can buy the product from John for $1,000,000, saving you $500,000.
* **Limited negotiation room:** Continuing to negotiate with Alice is unlikely to result in a price you'd find acceptable since she won't go below $1,500,000. 

It makes the most financial sense to cut your losses and buy from John."
