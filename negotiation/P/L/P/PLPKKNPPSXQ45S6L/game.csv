"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this fantastic product. It's a unique item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150.",150.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $150 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $60 for this product.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. How about we meet in the middle at $100? I think it's a fair price for this great product.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  While $100 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget. How about $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $90? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to compromise.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle at $82.5?  This way you are still making a profit and I am getting a decent deal.",82.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your creative suggestion, Bob, but I'm not comfortable with the $82.5 price. I can offer you a slight discount from my previous offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet at $92? It's still a bit higher than your last offer, but it's a compromise that works for me.",92.0,Alice,7,
