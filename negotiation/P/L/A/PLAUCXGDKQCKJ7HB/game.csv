"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $18,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'd be happy to pay $14,000 for it. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16,500. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,500 is still a bit too high for me. How about $15,500? This would be a fair deal for both of us.",15500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $16,500 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $15,500. I'm willing to reduce the price by $500, but I think $16,000 is the minimum I can accept. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you.",16000.0,Alice,5,
