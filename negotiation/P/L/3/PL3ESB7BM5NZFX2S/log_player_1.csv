"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum to leave room for negotiation, but also to try and secure a good price early on.  I'm aiming to get as close to Bob's perceived value of $150 as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low, significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $110 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm countering with $130. This is still above my minimum, but it's a significant reduction from my initial offer, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer. How about $120? That seems like a fair price to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $120 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $150, I don't want to risk losing the deal and getting only $120 from John.  I'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
