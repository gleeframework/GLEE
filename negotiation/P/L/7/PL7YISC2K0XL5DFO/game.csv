"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $8,000 at this time.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $9,000, which is a significant step closer to your asking price. Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still trying to work within my budget.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $9,000. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's reach an agreement, I'm sure we can find a way to make this work.",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stick with your previous offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $9,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'm offering it to you for $10,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but that's my absolute limit. We're both close to an agreement, let's make this happen!",9500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $9,500, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one final offer, so I'm offering it to you for $11,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",11000.0,Alice,9,
