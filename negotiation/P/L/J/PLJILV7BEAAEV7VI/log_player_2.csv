Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:

**Reasoning:**  Alice is holding firm near her bottom line. It's unlikely she'll go much lower than $825,000.  While you might squeeze out a few more dollars in further negotiation, it's not worth the risk of her ending negotiations. You have a guaranteed option with John at $800,000.  It's better to secure the product at your target price than to gamble on getting a slightly better deal and potentially lose out entirely."
