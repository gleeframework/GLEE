"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you our premium product for $9,500. This is a high-quality item that I believe would greatly benefit you, given its value to you is estimated at $8,000. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what you know John will sell it for.  It makes sense to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  However,  $9,500 is quite a bit more than I had budgeted for this.  I'd be willing to pay $7,000."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to anchor the negotiation much closer to your desired price range. Even if Alice rejects it outright, it gives you more room to negotiate upwards while still likely staying below your $8,000 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. In light of your offer, I am willing to consider a middle ground. I propose a price of $8,500 for the product. This still allows me to maintain a reasonable profit while being mindful of your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is coming down, $8,500 is still higher than John's price. There's room for one more counter-offer to try and get closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $8,000 even.  That's my absolute limit, otherwise I'll have to go with a different option."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct but respectful:**  This counter-offer acknowledges Alice's movement but is firm about your top price.
* **Slight ""buffer"" removed:** By saying $8,000 even, you signal this truly is your limit.
* **Alternative mentioned:** Reminding Alice you have another option adds subtle pressure without being overly aggressive.

Alice is likely to either accept this offer or counter with something very close to it."
