# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product I believe you'd be very interested in. It's worth a great deal to you, and I'm confident it can be a valuable asset. I'm offering it to you for $1,250,000. This price reflects the value I see in you as a buyer and the potential we both have to benefit from this transaction. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.
