"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price, considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $11,000?"", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By offering $11,000, I'm aiming for a price that's beneficial for me while still potentially acceptable to Alice (considering her product's worth is $12,000).
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of the message is polite and expresses continued interest, making it clear that I'm willing to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. While I understand your position, $11,000 is significantly below its value. Could you do $13,000? It's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Alice's counteroffer of $13,000 is closer to reasonable, there's still a gap between her price and my ideal purchase point. 
* **Leveraging John:**  The presence of John's offer at $15,000 gives me leverage. Alice knows I have an alternative, which might push her to make further concessions.
* **Testing Alice's Flexibility:** By rejecting this offer, I'm signaling that I'm serious about getting a better price and testing how flexible Alice is willing to be."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? That seems like a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Offering $12,000 represents a classic negotiation tactic of finding a compromise. This price is exactly between our previous offers and might be more appealing to Alice.
* **Knowing Her Value:** By offering $12,000, I'm matching what Alice values the product at. While she might prefer to make a profit, this offer eliminates the risk of her losing money and could be tempting.
* **Final Push:** This counteroffer could be my final push before considering John's offer more seriously. It signals that I'm getting closer to my limit but am still open to a deal with Alice."
