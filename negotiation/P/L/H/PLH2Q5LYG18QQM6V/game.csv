"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think a fair price for this product is $110. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a good deal. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your previous offer, so I'll offer $105. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $105 yet. I'm willing to go up to $115, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your latest offer, so I'll offer $112.50. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",112.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're still in the game, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway from your latest offer, but I need to make sure I get a good deal. I'm thinking of $115 again, but I'll throw in a small concession - I'll include a free accessory that's worth $20. So, the total value is $135. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the free accessory offer! That's a nice gesture. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your latest offer, so I'll offer $112.50 again. Would you be willing to accept that?",112.5,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting a bit stuck. I'm willing to meet you at $112.50, but I need to make sure I get a good deal. I'm going to throw in another concession - I'll give you a 5% discount on the total price, so you'll get the product for $106.25. That's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",106.25,Alice,9,
