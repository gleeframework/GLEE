"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $14000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a better deal than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, I'm only able to offer $12,000 at this time. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  While $12000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $13500. This would still allow me to make a reasonable profit, and it's a great price for such a valuable product.  Let's find a way to make this work for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $13,500 is a good price and shows Alice is willing to negotiate, Bob is still trying to save as much as possible. It's still worth pushing for his target price of $12,000."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still firm on my offer of $12,000. This is my final offer, as it's my maximum budget. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}
