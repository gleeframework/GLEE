"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $13,000 is less than your maximum of $15,000, you know you have another option with John. There's a chance you could get a better price by negotiating with Alice or going with John's offer."
