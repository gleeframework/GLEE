"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate further.  How about $1,150,000?  It's a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,150,000 is closer, but I'm still a little off. How about $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $1,075,000 is still a bit low, but I'm flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,112,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",1112500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I appreciate that. While $1,112,500 is close, I'm aiming for something under $1,100,000. Would you be willing to come down to $1,090,000?",1090000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your position. $1,090,000 is getting closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  To make this work for both of us, let's split the difference and go with $1,100,000.  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,7,
