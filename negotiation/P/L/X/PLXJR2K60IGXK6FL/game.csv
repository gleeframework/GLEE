"Thanks Alice, that's an interesting offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8000.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $9000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $12000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12000 is still a bit out of my budget. How about we split the difference and go for $10500?  I'm sure we can find a deal that works for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $13000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I can offer you the product for $12800. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great value for what you'll be getting.",12800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $12800 is still above my target. Let's try $11500. If we can find a compromise close to that, I think we can make a deal.",11500.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $12500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great value for what you'll be getting. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm going to have to consider other options.",12500.0,Alice,7,
