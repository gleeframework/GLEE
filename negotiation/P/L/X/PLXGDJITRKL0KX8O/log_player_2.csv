"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product! I think you'll love it. I'm offering it to you for $12000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer is above Bob's budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice! It's a great product but unfortunately, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be happy to pay $9,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to be aggressive in lowering the price. $9,000 is still within Bob's budget, but it gives Alice room to counter while leaving room for Bob to potentially compromise further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $10500. Is this a price you'd be comfortable with? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but it's still above his target.  Rejecting allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get an even lower price. There's also a chance Alice may lower her price even further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $10,500 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his initial budget, but he's showing that he's willing to be flexible. He's also highlighting the potential for closing the deal, putting pressure on Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you at $10500 was my previous offer, but I'll go a bit lower to $10250. Is this a price you'd be willing to pay? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to Bob's target price but is still $250 higher. Bob should continue to negotiate as he has a better offer from John. He can potentially get a better price or use John's offer as leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but I'm still a bit too high.  I'm willing to pay $10,100.  I'm hoping we can close this deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 10100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a small counteroffer, showing that he's serious about buying the product but still wants to save a little money.  He's aiming to put the pressure on Alice to close the deal, especially given the limited rounds remaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, and I'm not sure how much further I can go. I'll make one more concession: I'll sell the product to you for $10250. This is as low as I'm willing to go. Is this a price you'd be willing to pay? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has reached her minimum price, and Bob is still $250 above his target. While there's still a chance of negotiating further, the risk of not closing a deal is high. With only a few rounds left, it's more advantageous to buy the product from John at $10,000 and avoid further negotiation. This ensures Bob gets the product within his budget and avoids potential delays or further price increases."
