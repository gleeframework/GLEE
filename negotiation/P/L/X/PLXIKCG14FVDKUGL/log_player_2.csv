"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than buying from John, there's room for negotiation. Bob can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $750000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $950000. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, Bob can still potentially get a better price. There's a significant gap between Alice's offer and Bob's desired price, so rejecting and making another counteroffer makes sense. Bob can try to negotiate a price closer to his target range."

{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice.  However, $950,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $825,000. This is a fair price considering your value for the product and my budget. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this point."", ""product_price"": 825000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to reach a fair price, Bob, but $825000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $925000. This is the best I can do, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above Bob's desired price point. Bob has a better alternative in John, who is willing to sell for $1,200,000.  There's still a good chance Bob can negotiate a lower price with Alice, making it worthwhile to reject and make another counteroffer."
