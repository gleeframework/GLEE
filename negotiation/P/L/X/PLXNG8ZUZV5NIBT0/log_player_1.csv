Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  The product is worth significantly more than that to me, and I believe its value to you justifies a higher price.

Round 4

While $775,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired target. I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming to get closer to my desired price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but I'm still not comfortable going lower than $825,000.
