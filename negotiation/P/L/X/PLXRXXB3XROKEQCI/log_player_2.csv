"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product for you that I think you'd be very interested in.  It's something I've valued at no less than $12000, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $13500. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what you'd be willing to pay. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $13,500, while John wants $15,000.
* **You're still getting a good deal:** You value the product at $15,000, so even paying $13,500 saves you $1,500."
