"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit while leaving room for negotiation.  Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'll see if he's willing to bite at a significant premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,300,000 is a decent amount, I'm aiming for a higher price.  There are still 8 rounds left, and I believe I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,400,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a profitable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, $1,350,000 is still a significant profit and we're getting close to the middle ground.  We're already halfway through the rounds, and I don't want to risk losing out on a good deal by continuing to negotiate."
