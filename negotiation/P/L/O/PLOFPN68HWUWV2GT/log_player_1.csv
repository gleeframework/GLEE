"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit while leaving room for negotiation.  $20,000 is a significant markup from my minimum, but it's a starting point.  I'll see how Bob responds and adjust my strategy from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm not willing to settle just yet. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground.  There's still a good chance we can reach a more profitable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $18,000. This is still a good profit for me and hopefully more appealing to Bob than his previous offer. I'm hoping we can reach a compromise in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $17,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than John's offer and we're nearing the end of our negotiation rounds. It's time to secure the sale."
