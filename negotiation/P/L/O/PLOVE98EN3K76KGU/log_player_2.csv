"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm confident that this product is worth at least $12000, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a price that reflects both its worth and my desire to work with you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
