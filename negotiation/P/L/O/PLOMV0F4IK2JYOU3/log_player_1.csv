Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it to you first at a price of $19,000. It's a unique opportunity and I'm confident it would be a worthwhile investment."", ""product_price"": 19000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potential profit maximization.
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial high price will give you insight into how badly he wants the product.  If he accepts immediately, you know you could have potentially gone even higher. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a safety net with John, so you can afford to be a bit bolder in your initial offer to Bob.
* **Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly state the product's worth to Bob,  the phrase ""unique opportunity"" and ""worthwhile investment"" aim to pique his interest and subtly imply a higher value. 

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, be prepared to negotiate. You can gradually lower the price, but always keeping your $15,000 minimum in mind."
