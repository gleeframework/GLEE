{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $10,000 is more than the $8,000 Bob is willing to pay, giving him a potential bargain.
* **It's below your minimum:** It's still above your $12,000 minimum, so you're still making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  If Bob rejects, there's room to negotiate down slightly without sacrificing too much profit. 

I'm playing it strategically here by leaving the door open for a counter-offer.  If Bob comes back with a price that's too low, I can still walk away and sell to John for my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of a price more around $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because:

* **It's still below my minimum:**  While $9,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my $12,000 minimum. 
* **I can do better:** I'm confident that I can negotiate a higher price with Bob, or I can always sell to John for my minimum.  

By rejecting Bob's counteroffer, I keep the negotiation going and have a chance to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I appreciate your offer, $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. How about $9,500? This price is fair for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

This counteroffer is strategic for the following reasons:

* **It's a compromise:** It's a midpoint between my previous offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **It's still profitable:**  $9,500 is above my $12,000 minimum, so I'm still making a profit.
* **It leaves room for a final negotiation:**  If Bob rejects, I have room to come down slightly to $9,250, but I won't go below that.

By offering a compromise and leaving room for negotiation, I'm increasing the chances of reaching an agreement with Bob that's beneficial for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $9,250? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer because:

* **It's a fair compromise:**  $9,250 is a reasonable midpoint between my last offer of $9,500 and Bob's offer of $9,000. 
* **It's close to my desired price:** While it's still below my ideal price, it's significantly closer to my minimum of $12,000. 
* **There's a chance for a better offer:**  There's always a chance that Bob will make another counteroffer if I reject, but I'm not willing to risk losing the sale and having to sell to John for my minimum.

By accepting Bob's offer, I'm securing a good deal and ensuring a sale, which is more important than trying to squeeze out a few extra dollars."
