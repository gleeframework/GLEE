"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product, but  $1100000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd like to offer $950000.  What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $950000 is just a bit too low for me at this point.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000.  This still leaves room for both of us to walk away happy.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1000000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $975000.  Let's see if we can bridge that gap.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. However, $975000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $990000, which I believe is fair considering the value of the product. This way, we can both benefit from the deal. What do you think?",990000.0,Alice,5,
