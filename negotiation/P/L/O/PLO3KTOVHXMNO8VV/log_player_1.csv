Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product, but  $1100000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd like to offer $950000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $950,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum of $800,000. I'm confident I can get a better deal, so I'll reject Bob's offer and try to counter."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1000000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $975000.  Let's see if we can bridge that gap.

While $975,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still holding out for something higher. I'm confident I can secure a better deal by continuing negotiations, so I'll reject Bob's offer and attempt to counter."
