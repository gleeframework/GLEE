"Alice, while I recognize the value of this product, your initial offer is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,700,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my needs and the product's worth. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,700,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product has immense potential and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000?",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $2,000,000 is still too steep for me. My budget remains at $1,700,000.  If you're serious about selling, I believe this is a fair and realistic price. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I've been considering our conversations and I'm willing to adjust my price slightly. How about we settle at $1,900,000? This reflects my commitment to closing the deal while still acknowledging the value of this product.",1900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $1,700,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's reach an agreement and close this deal.",1700000.0,Bob,6,
