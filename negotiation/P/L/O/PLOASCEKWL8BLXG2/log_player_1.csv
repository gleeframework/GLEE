Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I recognize the value of this product, your initial offer is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,700,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my needs and the product's worth. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,700,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product has immense potential and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $2,000,000 is still too steep for me. My budget remains at $1,700,000.  If you're serious about selling, I believe this is a fair and realistic price. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000.

Bob seems firm on his $1,700,000 offer, but I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. I'm not willing to go below $1,800,000. Let's see if he's open to a slightly higher price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $1,700,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's reach an agreement and close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob seems firm on his $1,700,000 offer.  It's a significant profit over my minimum and continuing to negotiate might risk the deal entirely."
