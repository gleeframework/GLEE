"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. I've done some research and I believe that's a fair price for this product. Can we meet in the middle at $825000?",825000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you've done your research and have a good sense of the product's value. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $825000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more profit. I'm counteroffering at $840000. This is a fair price considering the product's rarity and the value it brings to the buyer.",840000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you need to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $825000, but I'd like to propose a slight discount since I'm willing to pay the full amount upfront. How about we do $820000?",820000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your willingness to pay upfront, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $820000. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $835000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",835000.0,Alice,5,
