Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves some room for negotiation, but still provides a good return for me. 

I'm aware that the product is worth $8,000 to Bob, so I'm aiming for a price that is a little more than his perceived value but still within a reasonable range for him to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer of $9,000. While it is better than his initial perceived value of $8,000, it is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}

I'm countering Bob's offer with a price of $10,000. This is a compromise that meets Bob halfway, giving him a better price than my initial offer while still leaving me with a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000. Bob's latest offer of $9,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price. While I could continue negotiating, it's clear that reaching a mutually agreeable price with Bob will be difficult. Selling to John guarantees me the best possible outcome and avoids further rounds of negotiation."
