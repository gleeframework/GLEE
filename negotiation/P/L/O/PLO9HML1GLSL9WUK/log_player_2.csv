{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $11,000 is a better price than Alice's initial value of $12,000, it's still above your maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth negotiating further to see if you can get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is closer to your budget than Alice's previous offer, it's still higher than your maximum. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a better price. There's always the option of buying from John for $8,000 if you're unable to reach a mutually acceptable agreement with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a compromise between your previous offer of $9,000 and Alice's current offer of $10,000. It shows a willingness to meet halfway, while still being slightly lower than Alice's price. This could potentially encourage Alice to accept the offer or counter with a price closer to your desired range."
