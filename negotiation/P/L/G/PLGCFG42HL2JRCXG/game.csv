"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $200 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $125.  What do you think?",125.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $125 is a bit too low for me.  Could you meet me halfway at $162.5?",162.5,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $162.5 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to go to $140. It's a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",140.0,Bob,4,
