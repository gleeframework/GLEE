"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you consider $14,000? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $14,000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $16,500. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $16,500 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $15,500? This would be a fair price for both of us, and it's the closest I can come to my budget.",15500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $16,000. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, though. How about $16,250? It's a compromise that I think you'll find reasonable. What do you think?",16250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $16,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $15,750. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",15750.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to reach a compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $16,000. I'm willing to give you a small discount, though. How about $16,100? It's a slight compromise, but I think it's a fair price for the product. What do you think?",16100.0,Alice,7,
