"Alice,  $1500000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm very interested in this product, but my budget is limited.  I'm willing to offer $800000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $800000 is below what I can accept, I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1100000? This price still reflects the significant value of this product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1100000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to make the purchase.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I see we're getting closer.  While $950000 is still a bit below my minimum, I'm willing to make one last concession.  I'm proposing $1050000. This price is fair for both of us, and I believe it reflects the real value of the product.  Let's close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
