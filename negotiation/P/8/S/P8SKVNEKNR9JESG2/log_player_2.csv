Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I see we're getting closer.  While $950000 is still a bit below my minimum, I'm willing to make one last concession.  I'm proposing $1050000. This price is fair for both of us, and I believe it reflects the real value of the product.  Let's close this deal.

This will save you time and potential frustration."
