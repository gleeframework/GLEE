"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is higher than our budget. We should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

We start with a significantly lower offer to understand Alice's bottom line. This leaves room for negotiation while staying under our $8,000 maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $6,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $8,500?  That gives you a good deal, and it's still within my range. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to our budget, but we're still not there. We can try to negotiate a little further down before accepting her offer or going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to what I can afford. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?"", 
""product_price"": 7500
}
``` 

We're aiming for a price that's a compromise between her last offer and our previous counteroffer. This shows we're willing to negotiate but also holding onto a reasonable price point."
