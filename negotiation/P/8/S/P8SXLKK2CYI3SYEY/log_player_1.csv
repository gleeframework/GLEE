"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially offering it at $2,250,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and potential."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Negotiating with a high initial offer leaves room for negotiation. It also helps establish the perceived value of the product in Bob's mind.
* **Not Too High:** While we want to start high, an outrageously high price might discourage Bob from further negotiation. This offer is significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and our minimum, but not unbelievably so.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the ""unique value proposition"" and ""true worth,"" we aim to anchor the price in Bob's mind to something beyond just the $1,000,000 he currently perceives.

This strategy allows us to gauge Bob's willingness to pay while keeping the door open for a mutually beneficial deal. We can always come down in price, but it's much harder to go up from a low starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is closer to our minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than our target. We're in the early stages of negotiation, and rejecting this offer allows us to:

* **Maintain a strong position:**  Accepting immediately might make us appear overly eager and limit our negotiating power in future rounds.
* **Explore higher potential:** We know Bob values the product, and his counteroffer suggests he's willing to pay more than his initial perception of $1,000,000. 
* **Leverage the John option:** Having John as a backup buyer gives us a safety net, allowing us to push for a better deal with Bob.

We'll aim for a counteroffer that meets Bob somewhere between his offer and our previous price, keeping the negotiation moving while still striving for a higher selling price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but I believe the product's unique features and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes its true value."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're reducing our asking price by $250,000, demonstrating flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Holding Ground:**  The new price of $2,000,000 is still significantly above Bob's offer, keeping us closer to our target and leaving room for further negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** By calling it a ""fair compromise"" and highlighting the ""true value,"" we're emphasizing the value proposition to justify the price.

We're aiming to find a sweet spot where Bob feels like he's getting a better deal while still securing a significant profit for ourselves."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,700,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob increased his offer, but only by $100,000, and it's still significantly below our $2,000,000 ask. This suggests:

* **Bob is willing to negotiate:** He hasn't walked away, indicating continued interest and potential for a deal.
* **He might have room to move:** The small increase suggests he might be holding back and could be persuaded to go higher. 
* **Time is a factor:**  We have fewer rounds remaining, and Bob knows we have the option to sell to John.

We need to signal that his current offer is unacceptable while keeping him engaged. Rejecting this offer allows us to counter with a price that maintains pressure but potentially moves us closer to a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, your current offer is a bit too far from what I had in mind. I'm willing to accept $1,900,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm Stance:** By stating this is our final offer, we're creating a sense of urgency and signaling that we're serious about our price.
* **Significant Concession:** We're dropping by $100,000, showing flexibility and willingness to close the deal.
* **Mid-Ground:** This price is a significant move towards Bob, but still above his last offer, aiming to encourage him to meet us closer to the middle ground.
* **Time Pressure:** With fewer rounds remaining, this firm stance combined with a concession might push Bob to accept or propose a more aggressive counteroffer. 

We're taking a calculated risk here.  Bob might walk away, but the potential reward of getting closer to our target price outweighs the risk of accepting his previous offer or selling to John at this stage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,650,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm willing to make one more concession. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** We are now past the halfway point in the negotiations with only four rounds remaining. Bob knows we have the option to go with John.
* **Minimal Gains vs. Risk:**  While $1,650,000 is less than our desired price, it's a reasonable increase from Bob's previous offer.  Continuing to negotiate has diminishing returns and risks him walking away. 
* **Acceptable Profit:** This offer is still a significant profit above our minimum of $1,500,000. 

It's time to secure a good deal rather than risk losing Bob entirely and settling for the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
