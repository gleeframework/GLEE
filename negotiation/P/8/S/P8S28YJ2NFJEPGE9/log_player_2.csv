"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $15,000, but Alice's offer is $12,000, which is still more than the product is worth to you.
* **Negotiation is possible.** Since you have 10 rounds, you can try to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback.**  If you can't get a good deal with Alice, you have the option of buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. However, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. Would you be willing to consider $10,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but not unreasonable:** A $2,000 reduction from Alice's offer is a significant move, but it's still within your budget and leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Focus on fairness:** The message emphasizes a ""fair"" price for both parties, appealing to Alice's sense of reason and potentially increasing her willingness to compromise. 
* **Keeps the door open:** This counteroffer acknowledges Alice's offer while expressing your intent to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $10000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  How about we split the difference and go with $11000?  It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:** While Alice has lowered her price, $11,000 is still more than what you're willing to pay for this product. 
* **Room for further negotiation:** You still have 7 rounds remaining, and Alice has shown flexibility, so there's potential to get a lower price.
* **Buying from John is a backstop:** If negotiation fails, you have a guaranteed alternative with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for being open to negotiation.  I appreciate your flexibility. I'm still not quite there at $11,000.  How about $10,500?  It's closer to your last offer, and a more comfortable price point for me."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental offer:**  This counteroffer moves closer to Alice's offer, showing that you're willing to meet her halfway, but still maintains a lower price point. 
* **Emphasizes comfort:**  Mentioning a ""comfortable"" price reinforces that you're not just trying to get the lowest price, but find a solution that works for both sides.
* **Keeps the momentum:**  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving and shows a clear path to reaching an agreement."
