"Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll still be happy with the product.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $11,500 is still not quite there for me. How about $12,500?  That's a good price for both of us, and it will allow me to keep my profit margin reasonable.  Let's try to reach a compromise so we can both be happy with this deal.",12500.0,Alice,5,
