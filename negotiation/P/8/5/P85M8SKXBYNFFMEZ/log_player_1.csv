**Reasoning:**

While we could push for a bit more, Bob is clearly willing to negotiate and has steadily increased his offer. Accepting $910,000 represents a significant profit above our minimum, and there's a risk Bob might walk away if we push too hard. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk getting stuck with a lower offer or having to sell to John for our minimum."
