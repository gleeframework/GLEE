"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11500. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

While $11,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $15,000.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."

While $12,200 is close to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price.  I'm confident I can get closer to my goal with John, so I'll take his offer."
