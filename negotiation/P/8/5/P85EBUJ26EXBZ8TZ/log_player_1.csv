"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This initial offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're already aiming for more than your minimum value of $800,000.
* **It's not too aggressive:**  $900,000 is a reasonable starting point that leaves room for negotiation. 
* **It opens the conversation:**  The message is friendly and encourages Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my value for it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is below your minimum, it's still within the range of what you'd potentially accept. However, there are a few reasons to reject it at this point:

* **You have time:**  You have 8 rounds left, and you can counteroffer to try and get closer to your desired price.
* **Bob's counteroffer was aggressive:**  He went down significantly from your initial offer, showing he's willing to negotiate.
* **You're still in a strong position:**  You know John is willing to pay $800,000, so you have a safety net.

**Next Steps:**

You'll counter Bob's offer in the next round. It's likely you'll meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $750,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** My counteroffer splits the difference between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to compromise. 
* **Highlighting the value:** I remind Bob of the product's worth to emphasize the fairness of my offer.
* **Positive tone:** I keep the message friendly and encouraging to keep the negotiation going.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to find a compromise and move the negotiation towards a successful outcome.  I'm still above my minimum, leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $850,000 is still a bit higher than I can afford.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is a fair price given its value to me. Let's close the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Your Minimum:** Bob's offer of $800,000 is exactly your minimum acceptable price.
* **No Further Upside:** You've already negotiated down from your initial offer, and there's no guarantee you'll get a better price in subsequent rounds.
* **Time is Valuable:** You have 6 rounds remaining, and each round takes time. There's a risk that Bob will continue to reject offers, or that John's offer could expire.

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and efficient sale at your minimum acceptable price. It's the most pragmatic choice given the current negotiation dynamics."
