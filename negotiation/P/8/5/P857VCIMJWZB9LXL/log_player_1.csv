"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $9,500. This is a significant amount for Bob, and I'm hoping he'll be willing to negotiate from here.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum desired price of $8,000. I'm willing to risk going through another round of negotiation before considering selling to John. I'll counteroffer Bob with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $9,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but still above my minimum acceptable price. Hopefully, this will entice him to accept the offer and avoid further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $8,700 is just above my minimum price of $8,000.  I've already rejected two offers from Bob, and it's possible the negotiation could continue to go down.  At this point, I think it's wiser to accept Bob's offer and secure the deal rather than risk losing the sale altogether."
