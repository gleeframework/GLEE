"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $175 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, knowing Bob values it at $100. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Tone:**  A friendly message helps build rapport and makes Bob more receptive. 
* **Open-Ended Question:** The question encourages Bob to engage and potentially make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $175 is a bit high. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $120 is significantly lower than my minimum of $150. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation.  
* **Value to Bob:**  I know Bob values the product at $100, so there's still some potential for him to increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $140.  Let's try to make this work!"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my minimum ($150) and Bob's offer ($120). This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is positive and emphasizes finding a solution. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  ""Let's try to make this work"" subtly reminds Bob of the value of the product and encourages him to come closer to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $130 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential to Increase:**  I'm only two rounds away from selling to John for $150. There's still a chance Bob will come closer to my minimum if I reject his offer.
* **Limited Downside:** If I reject and Bob walks away, I can still sell to John for a profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  $130 is closer, but I really need to get at least $145 for this. I'm willing to meet you halfway there.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 145} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:**  I'm only increasing my offer by $5, showing flexibility while still holding onto a significant portion of my profit margin.
* **""Meet You Halfway"":** This phrasing emphasizes that I'm willing to compromise and puts the ball in Bob's court.
* **Reiterating Value:**  ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to consider the value of the product again.

**Note:** We are now getting close to my minimum, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer. If he doesn't, I'm prepared to sell to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to pay $135 for it, but that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $135 is getting close to my minimum of $150, but it's still not enough. 
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  If I reject and counteroffer again, there's a high chance Bob will walk away, leaving me with nothing.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John for $150 guarantees me a profit and avoids the risk of a failed negotiation with Bob.

While it's tempting to try for a few more rounds with Bob, the risk of losing the deal entirely outweighs the potential to gain a few extra dollars. Selling to John now ensures a successful transaction."
