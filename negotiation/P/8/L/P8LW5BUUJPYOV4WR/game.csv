"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you! I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this incredible item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $18000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $8500 at this time.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $12000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9500.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11500. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",11500.0,Alice,5,
