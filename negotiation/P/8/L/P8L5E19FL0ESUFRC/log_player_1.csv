"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product. I believe it's a great value at $1,200,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price, knowing that I have a backup buyer in John who is willing to pay significantly more. This leaves room for negotiation and potential counteroffers from Bob.
* **Realistic but Ambitious:**  $1,200,000 is a significant discount from my minimum price but still represents a considerable profit for me.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message is friendly and open to discussion, indicating a willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks Alice, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob's offer is higher than his initial valuation, it's still significantly lower than my minimum price of $1,500,000. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  I'm confident that I can get a better deal with Bob by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer. 
* **Value of Negotiating:**  The back-and-forth of negotiation helps me understand Bob's true willingness to pay and could lead to a more profitable deal for me.
* **Selling to John is a Backup:**  Having John as a backup buyer gives me the flexibility to walk away from the deal if I don't get a satisfactory offer from Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer is a Compromise:** My counteroffer is a significant drop from my initial offer but still maintains a significant profit margin for me. 
* **Show Flexibility:** I'm demonstrating my willingness to negotiate and reach a compromise.
* **Reasoning:**  I provide a reason for my counteroffer, emphasizing the value of the product.
* **Open Invitation:** My message invites Bob to continue the discussion and potentially reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position but $1,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.  Let's try to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still significantly below my minimum price of $1,500,000.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:**  I'm not in a rush to sell. There's still room to negotiate and potentially get a higher price from Bob.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $1,500,000 gives me the leverage to hold out for a better deal from Bob.
* **Value of Time:**  By continuing the negotiation, I can see if Bob is truly willing to go higher."
