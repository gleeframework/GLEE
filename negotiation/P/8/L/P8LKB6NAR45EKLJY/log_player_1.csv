"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but it establishes a strong starting point and leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to negotiate towards a price that benefits both of us."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round, where I can make a counteroffer. I still believe there is potential to negotiate a deal that is mutually beneficial."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}

I'm counter-offering at $1,750,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still above my minimum price. I'm hoping this demonstrates flexibility and willingness to compromise, encouraging Bob to come closer to my desired price."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at the expense of my own financial goals.  I will reject his offer and continue to negotiate with Bob.  I want to see if there's more room for him to increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $1,600,000.  This shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a price that's fair to me. I'm hoping this will motivate Bob to come closer to a deal that meets both of our needs."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  While it's getting closer, I'm not willing to settle for less than $1,500,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push him higher with another counteroffer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

This is my final offer.  I'm dropping the price to $1,550,000, which is only $50,000 above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping that Bob will recognize this is a fair and reasonable price. If he rejects this, I will sell the product to John."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached the point where Bob's offers are not getting any closer to my minimum acceptable price.  I've already made significant concessions, but I'm not willing to go any lower.  To guarantee a reasonable profit, I will sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
