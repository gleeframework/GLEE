Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it's worth $1,000,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Justification for value:** By mentioning that you believe the product is worth $1,000,000, you anchor Bob's perception of the product's value at a higher point. Even if he doesn't agree to $1,000,000, it makes it more likely he'll be willing to pay more than $800,000. 

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. He might counter-offer, and you'll need to decide how low you're willing to go before accepting John's offer."
