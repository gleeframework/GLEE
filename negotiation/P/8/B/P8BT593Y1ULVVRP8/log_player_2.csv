{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $875,000, which is within my budget and a good deal considering the value of the product. While I could potentially negotiate a lower price, it's getting close to the price I can get from John, and there's no guarantee of further success.  Accepting this offer minimizes risk and saves time."
