"Hi Bob, I understand that $80 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",100.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $85 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $95. It's getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",95.0,Alice,5,
