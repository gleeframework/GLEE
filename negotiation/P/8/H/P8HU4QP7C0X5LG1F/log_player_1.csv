"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000.  This leaves room for negotiation while still maximizing my potential profit.  I'll be ready to adjust my offer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'm not yet ready to sell to John for $1,500,000 because I'm confident I can secure a higher price through continued negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,600,000. This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my minimum.  I believe Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and be more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still not comfortable accepting it. I'm willing to keep negotiating, as I believe we can reach a price that's mutually beneficial. I'm also still holding out for a slightly higher price, and I don't want to sell to John for $1,500,000 just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

I'm making a final concession to Bob, dropping my price to $1,550,000.  This is close to my minimum value, but it's important to remember that Bob values the product at $1,000,000. This offer is still significantly better for him than walking away.  I believe he'll be more inclined to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only 4 rounds left, the negotiations are getting tense.  Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm worried that we won't be able to reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds.  To ensure I don't lose out on a guaranteed sale, I'm choosing to sell to John for $1,500,000. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a decent profit and guarantees a sale."
