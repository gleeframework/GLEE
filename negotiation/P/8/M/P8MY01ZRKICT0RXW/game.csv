"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $950,000 is simply too low for me to consider at this point.  I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $1,050,000?  This reflects the value of the product and leaves room for us both to be happy with the outcome.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
