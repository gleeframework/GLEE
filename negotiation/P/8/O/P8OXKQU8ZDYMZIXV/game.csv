"Hello Bob, I'm excited to start our negotiation. I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I need to let you know that I'm looking for a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm thinking of starting at $1,800,000.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,800,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value you place on it and my own budget constraints. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $1,600,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,450,000, which is a good compromise considering we're both trying to find a deal. This is my final offer before I consider other options.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $1,550,000, which is just $50,000 above your last offer. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,550,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,500,000, which is my absolute maximum. If you're willing to accept this, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
