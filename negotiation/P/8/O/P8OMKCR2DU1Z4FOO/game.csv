"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about we start the conversation at $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $20,000 reflects the true value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $17,000.  This is a significant reduction and I believe it's a fair offer considering the benefits you'll gain.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $17,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Could we meet in the middle somewhere around $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
