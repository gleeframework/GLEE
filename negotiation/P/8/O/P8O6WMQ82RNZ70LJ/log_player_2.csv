"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. This is a substantial discount from its true worth, and I'm confident you'll see the tremendous potential it holds.  Let's discuss further if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your constraints, but $1000000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity. To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $1250000.  This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my budget. I can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate, or I can buy from John and be done with it.  I'll see if I can push Alice lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $1,100,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I want to make this work. However, $1100000 is still below the value I see in this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1175000. This is a fair price considering the unique opportunity this product presents.  Let me know if you're ready to finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,175,000 is still above my budget, and I'm not sure I can push her any lower. At this point, it's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $1,000,000. While it's not the absolute lowest price, it guarantees I get the product within my budget and avoids further negotiation."
