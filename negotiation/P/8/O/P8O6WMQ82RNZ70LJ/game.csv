"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. This is a substantial discount from its true worth, and I'm confident you'll see the tremendous potential it holds.  Let's discuss further if you're interested.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I can only go up to $1000000 at this time.  Let me know if you're willing to consider this price.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your constraints, but $1000000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity. To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $1250000.  This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1250000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $1100000. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I want to make this work. However, $1100000 is still below the value I see in this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1175000. This is a fair price considering the unique opportunity this product presents.  Let me know if you're ready to finalize the deal.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
