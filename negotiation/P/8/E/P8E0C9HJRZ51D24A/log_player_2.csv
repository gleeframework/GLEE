Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9000.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can sell the product to you for $8800. This is my best offer for now, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $8,800 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than John's price and closer to Bob's desired price range. It's also a reasonable compromise, as Alice has already lowered her price from the initial offer.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price without risking further negotiations."
