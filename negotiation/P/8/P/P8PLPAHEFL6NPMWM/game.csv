"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a rare opportunity, and I believe it would be highly valuable to your business. My initial price is $1,350,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.  What are your thoughts?",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. This product is interesting to me, but $1,350,000 is a bit outside my budget.  Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I need to ensure I receive a fair price for this valuable product.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This price reflects the true value of the product while still providing you with a good deal.  Let's work together to find a solution.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
