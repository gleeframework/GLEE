"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $8,500?  It's a fair price, and I think we can both be happy with that.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. That's my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",7500.0,Bob,4,
