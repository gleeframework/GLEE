"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,800. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget.",10800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but $10,800 just doesn't work for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,150? That's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.",11150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $11,150. How about we meet in the middle at $10,900? That's the best I can do.",10900.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,900 is still a little too low for me. Let's try $11,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm really interested in the product, but I'm starting to think I should just go with John's offer at $10,000. Can you meet me at $10,500? That's as low as I'm willing to go.",10500.0,Bob,6,
