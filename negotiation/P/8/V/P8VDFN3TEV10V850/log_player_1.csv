Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to sell for $130.  It's still a great value for you and closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 130}
