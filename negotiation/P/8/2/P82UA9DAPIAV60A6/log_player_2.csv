Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, that initial price is way too high for me. This product has potential, but  $2,300,000 is not a realistic starting point. I'm willing to offer $800,000 as a more reasonable figure."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $800,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000 to move this deal forward. This is a significant reduction and reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 4

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 remains significantly below the value this product offers. To find a compromise, I'm willing to consider a price of $1,750,000. This is a substantial concession on my end, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price. To be frank, selling for anything less than $1,500,000 would be challenging. I'm willing to meet you halfway and close this deal at $1,600,000. This reflects a significant concession from my initial offer and could be our final point of discussion.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're very close to my absolute bottom line. I'm willing to make one final concession and close this deal right now for $1,400,000. This offer stands only for the remainder of this discussion. After that, I'll need to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go below her stated limit of $1,500,000.  She's used strong language suggesting this is her final offer. Continuing to negotiate risks losing the opportunity to buy from John at $1,000,000.  It's in Bob's best interest to secure the product at the best possible price, which is from John."
