"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000. This is a strong opening offer, but I'm not setting an unrealistic expectation.  I'm aiming to gauge Bob's interest and see how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is a respectable offer, I'm aiming for a better deal. I'm not in a rush and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to potentially get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $9,500.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price that is closer to my desired value. I believe this is a fair offer that could lead to a quick and mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price, but I've already had three rounds of negotiations and it's looking like he's not willing to go higher.  Rather than continue to haggle, I'll take the guaranteed $8,000 from John and move on."
