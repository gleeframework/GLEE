{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still too high, and I'm not willing to pay that much.  It's worth trying to get a better price. I'm going to reject her offer and continue to negotiate. There are still a few rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a better deal."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is now back down to $95. This is the same as her initial offer, which I rejected earlier. However, with only a few rounds remaining, it's becoming riskier to continue rejecting offers. There's a chance that Alice might be unwilling to negotiate further, and I might end up having to buy from John for $100. Accepting this offer means I save $5 compared to buying from John."
