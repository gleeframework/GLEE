"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12500 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9000? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12500 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000.
