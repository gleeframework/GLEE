This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** You're buying the product for $975,000, which is well below John's price of $1,500,000 and a significant discount from Alice's initial offer.
* **Final Offer:** Alice has stated this is her final offer, signaling she's unlikely to go lower. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Alice walking away, forcing you to buy from John at a higher price. 

While you might be able to negotiate a slightly lower price, the potential savings are likely outweighed by the risk of losing the deal with Alice."
