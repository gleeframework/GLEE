Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this price reflects its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $15,000, offering it slightly below that at $14,000 maximizes your potential profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is close to Bob's valuation, it leaves a small margin for potential negotiation if he tries to counter-offer. 
* **Secure a Sale:**  The offer is significantly higher than your guaranteed sale price to John ($10,000), making it highly likely Bob will accept and you'll secure a better deal."
