Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment. I'm asking for $950,000.  Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you start with a strong position. Offering it slightly below that at $950,000 aims to secure a significant portion of the potential profit. 
* **Room for negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, should he be very interested. This allows for a potential agreement that's still highly profitable for you.
* **Justification of value:** The message subtly emphasizes the product's value to Bob, aiming to justify the high price. This is important since Bob's perceived value ($800,000) is lower than the asking price.

**Important Note:**  This strategy prioritizes maximizing profit. It's possible Bob might be turned off by the high initial price. A different approach could involve a lower starting price with the goal of fostering a more collaborative negotiation."
