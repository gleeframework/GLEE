"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $125?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm happy to meet you halfway, but $125 is just too low for me. I'm willing to drop the price to $150, which is a significant discount from my initial offer.  What do you think?",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I would like to propose a price of $130. This still allows for a good discount while staying within my spending limit.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm really trying to work with you here, but $130 is still a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $140?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal today.",140.0,Alice,5,
