Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $19,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value is Impossible:** In a real-world scenario, you (Alice) wouldn't know Bob values the product at $12,000.  
* **Aim High, Room to Negotiate:** Starting with a price of $19,000 allows room for negotiation. If Bob counters, you can gradually decrease the price while staying above your minimum ($15,000). 
* **Backup Offer Secures Minimum:** The fact that John will buy the product for $15,000 means you have a safety net. It's better to aim high with Bob and potentially earn more.
* **Message Tone:** The message strikes a balance between being confident about the product's value and leaving room for discussion."
