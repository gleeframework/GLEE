"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $9,000 for this product.  How about we split the difference and agree on $8,750?",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,000 and $8,750, which would be $8,375. Can you consider this offer?",8375.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,375 is still too far below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down one more time, but $8,500 is my absolute bottom line.  If we can agree on that, great.  Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",8500.0,Alice,5,
