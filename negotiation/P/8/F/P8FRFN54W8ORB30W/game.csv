"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a price closer to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,500 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,200. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,3,
