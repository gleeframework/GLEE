Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $950,000 is simply too far below my minimum. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,025,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's much closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.
