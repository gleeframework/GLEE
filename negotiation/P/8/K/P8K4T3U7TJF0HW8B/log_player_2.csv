"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer is above his maximum budget. It's best to reject and see if he can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price as close to his $10,000 limit as possible.  Offering $9,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's original price and leaves some room for negotiation. It's a strong starting point for a counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still too high for Bob.  He has a few rounds left and there's still room to negotiate further.  Bob should reject and see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to split the difference between his last offer and Alice's current offer.  This shows a willingness to compromise while still keeping the price below his $10,000 limit. If Alice is serious about selling, she might be more willing to accept this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  He has several rounds left, and he should try to negotiate a lower price.  There's still a good chance he can get it for $10,000 or less.  He should reject and see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is Bob's final offer.  It's his maximum budget, and it's unlikely he'll be able to get a lower price.  Alice has rejected several offers, so it's time to see if she's willing to accept. If not, Bob can always buy from John at the same price."
