"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's offer of $11,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.
* There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and counter-offering allows Bob to try to get a better price."

Alice's offer:

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. 
* Alice's offer of $11,200 is still higher than Bob's ideal price, but closer to his maximum budget.
* Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try one more counteroffer before potentially resorting to John."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $11,000 is still above Bob's ideal price and very close to his maximum budget of $12,000. 
* There is a risk that further negotiation will not result in a lower price from Alice, and Bob might end up with the product for $12,000 anyway. 
* To avoid this risk, it is more sensible for Bob to buy the product from John for $12,000, as it is a guaranteed price within his budget."
