"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1100000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product at $1,200,000. This gives us room to negotiate and hopefully get a good price, but still leaves a decent profit margin for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is a decent amount, it's still significantly lower than what I want for the product. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate with Bob, so I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show good faith, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my ideal value. This keeps the negotiation moving forward and hopefully leads to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$900,000 is still too low, and I'm confident I can get a better price. I have 6 rounds left to negotiate with Bob, so I'm going to continue trying to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm going to stick to my guns and offer a price that's still in my range but closer to Bob's last offer.  He's shown he's willing to negotiate, and I believe we're getting closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I still have 4 rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway this round, as we only have 3 rounds left. He's shown a willingness to negotiate, and I believe this price is a good compromise that will hopefully lead to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum but still not quite there. With only two rounds left, the risk of a counteroffer I can't accept is too high. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum profit, and it's the safest option at this stage."
