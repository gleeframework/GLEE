Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This sets a high bar and gives me room to negotiate.  I'm confident that John will offer me $100 if I need to move on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is close to my minimum, but I can likely get more. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired price, but still lower than my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still staying above my minimum. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm confident in the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now very close to my minimum, and I'm not sure I'll be able to get a better price. It's better to secure the sale at $95 than to risk getting a lower offer from Bob or having to sell to John for $100."
