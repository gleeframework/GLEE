"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product for $11,000. It's a fair compromise considering its value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $11,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500. This price reflects the value of the product to me, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $10,500 is still a bit above your target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product for $11,200. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's value to me.",11200.0,Alice,5,
