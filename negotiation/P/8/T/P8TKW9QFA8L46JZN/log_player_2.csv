"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for $12,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to reject the offer and counter-offer.  The product is only worth $10,000 to you, so paying $12,000 is too much. It's also better to avoid buying from John right away since you may be able to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product for $11,000. It's a fair compromise considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $11,000 is closer to your ideal price, it's still a bit high. There's still room for negotiation, so it's worth rejecting the offer and trying for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $11,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500. This price reflects the value of the product to me, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,500 is still a bit above your target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product for $11,200. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice has come down a bit, but it's still not within your desired price range. It's getting close to the end of the rounds and you don't want to risk losing the opportunity to buy from John. At this point, it's better to go with John's offer and secure the product at your target price."
