"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a significant discount, but I'm afraid I need to stay closer to the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1600000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $1500000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to finalize the deal.",1500000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm afraid $1500000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1400000, which I previously offered. I'm confident that's a fair price for the product. If you're willing to accept it, I'm ready to finalize the deal.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
