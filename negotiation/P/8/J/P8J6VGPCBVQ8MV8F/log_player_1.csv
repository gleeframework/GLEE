I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,400,000. This is a strong starting point, leaving room for negotiation but still giving me a significant profit.  I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

At this point, I'm running out of time and Bob isn't willing to budge much further. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob for a higher price,  $1,000,000 from John is still a good deal.  It meets my minimum and ensures I don't lose out on a potential sale completely. I'll choose to sell to John."
