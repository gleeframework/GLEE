{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:** I want to maximize my profit, so I'm aiming for a price closer to my $1,500,000 minimum.
* **Negotiation Room:**  $1,450,000 leaves room for some negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can come down a bit, but I still have a buffer before reaching John's offer.
* **Attractive to Bob:** The price is significantly lower than my minimum and likely within his range of interest, given the product's value to him is $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is too Low:** $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer would leave me with a substantial loss. 
* **Potential for Counteroffers:** While Bob has a limited budget, he has expressed interest. This suggests he may be willing to negotiate further. 
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay my desired price. However, I still want to explore the possibility of getting closer to that amount with Bob. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a higher price, potentially reaching a compromise that is more beneficial to me."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, though. How about $1,350,000? That's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer is a compromise between my desired price and Bob's initial offer. It shows a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price that's profitable for me.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob, reminding him that $1,350,000 is still a good deal for him.
* **Positive Tone:** The message maintains a positive tone, focusing on finding a solution that benefits both parties. This helps to keep the negotiation amicable and increases the likelihood of reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,350,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $1,275,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** While Bob has moved closer to my minimum, $1,275,000 is still below my desired profit margin.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, and I believe there's still potential to reach a price closer to my target.
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed backup offer from John, giving me the flexibility to continue negotiating with Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price closer to my target, aiming for a compromise that will maximize my profit."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,275,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. How about $1,312,500?

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Compromise:** I'm continuing to make small concessions while still staying above my minimum price. This shows flexibility without jeopardizing my profit margin.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I'm still a bit short. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is very close to my desired price of $1,312,500. This is a good compromise considering I'm still making a substantial profit.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:** It seems Bob is nearing his limit.  Continuing to counter could risk losing him as a buyer and I might end up with John's offer which is only slightly higher.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Accepting this offer guarantees a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation leading to a stalemate or Bob walking away altogether.

While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer is the most pragmatic choice. It ensures a sale and minimizes the risk of losing a buyer while still securing a profitable outcome."
