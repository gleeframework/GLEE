Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $120, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $80, but still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Room for negotiation:** This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially reach a price that is mutually beneficial.
* **John as a safety net:** Knowing I have John as a backup buyer for $150 gives me confidence to negotiate with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $60? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $60 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting it would result in a huge loss for me.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** Even though Bob rejected my initial offer, he is willing to negotiate. This indicates there's potential for a mutually agreeable price.
* **John is a strong fallback:**  I can always sell to John for $150, making me comfortable rejecting Bob's low offer and continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90. This is still a good deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to negotiate by coming down from my initial $120 offer.
* **Still above my minimum:** $90 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, ensuring I don't lose money. 
* **Attractive to Bob:**  $90 is still a good deal for Bob, considering his perceived value of $80. This increases the likelihood of him accepting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a higher price, Alice, and I'm willing to move a little.  How about $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob has shown willingness to negotiate, $75 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **John is a safe and profitable alternative:**  I can sell the product to John for $150, which is a guaranteed profit and avoids further negotiation. 
* **Risk of further decline:**  There's no guarantee that Bob will increase his offer further, and continuing to negotiate might lead to an even lower price or a stalemate.

By selling to John, I ensure a favorable outcome and avoid potentially losing money in further negotiation."
