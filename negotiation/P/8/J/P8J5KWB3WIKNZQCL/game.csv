"Bob, I'm excited about the possibility of you acquiring this product. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be very beneficial for your business.

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value and potential benefits of the product. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be within my budget.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 is significantly lower than the product's true value. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $775,000. This price reflects the benefits you'll gain from the product while staying within a reasonable range. I believe this is a fair offer that benefits both of us. What do you say?",775000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $775,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $725,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value I'll get from the product without breaking the bank.",725000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're close to an agreement.  $725,000 is still a bit too low, but I'm willing to compromise further.  How about $750,000? This would ensure you get a great deal on a valuable product while allowing me to make a fair profit. It's a win-win situation. Let's finalize this deal!",750000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm glad we're close, but $750,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one final offer of $725,000. I think this is a fair price that balances my budget with the value I'll get from the product. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to consider purchasing from John for $800,000.",725000.0,Bob,6,
