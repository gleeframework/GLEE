"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm afraid $1,300,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to consider a price of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price given the product's value and my budget constraints.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
