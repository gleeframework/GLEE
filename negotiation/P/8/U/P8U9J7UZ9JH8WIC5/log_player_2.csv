Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're sticking to your $9,000 budget, but I really need to get closer to $11,000 to make this work.  Let's think about it this way:  This product can save you a lot of money in the long run, and it's a one-time investment.  If you're willing to compromise a bit, I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we split the difference and go with $10,000?  It's a fair compromise, and it allows me to move forward with the sale.
