Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and ensuring Bob has a good deal. Here's why:

* **For me:** It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  
* **For Bob:** It's still a great deal since he values the product at $1,500,000. He saves $50,000 and still gets a valuable product. 

By offering a price in the middle, I increase the chances of Bob accepting, allowing me to potentially earn more than I would from John."
