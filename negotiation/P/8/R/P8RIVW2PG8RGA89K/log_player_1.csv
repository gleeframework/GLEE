``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation without risking losing the sale immediately.  It also demonstrates confidence in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I'm willing to pay up to $750,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products. Would you be willing to consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 
 
While Bob's offer is still within the product's value range for him, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I need to hold out for a better offer.  I'm not ready to settle for that price yet.  The next round will allow me to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the market value. However, this product is unique and offers specific advantages that justify a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $800,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value. Let's find common ground. "", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your point about the product's unique advantages, Alice. However, I'm still not willing to pay the full $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I want. I'm not willing to risk a further negotiation, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John. It's time to secure the sale and move on."
