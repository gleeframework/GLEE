"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's valuation but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a chance to maximize my profit, while also being open to a deal. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120, as I mentioned earlier. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum price of $150. I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $120 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $140, which is still a good price for both of us. Let's close this deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground by offering a price that's still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer.  I'm also emphasizing the fairness of the price and the desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $110, as I mentioned earlier. I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $110 is still too low. It's below my minimum price of $150.  I've already gone through a few rounds of negotiation and it seems unlikely that Bob will come up to a price that's acceptable to me.  Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $150.  This ensures that I get at least my minimum price and avoids further time wasted on a potentially fruitless negotiation."
