"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120, as I mentioned earlier. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",120.0,Bob,2,,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $120 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $140, which is still a good price for both of us. Let's close this deal. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $110, as I mentioned earlier. I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial price.
