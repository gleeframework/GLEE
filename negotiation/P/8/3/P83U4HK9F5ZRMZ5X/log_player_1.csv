{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $120 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer sets a price above my minimum value but below the maximum value Bob is willing to pay. This gives Bob some room to negotiate but also ensures I don't sell too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $100. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

While $100 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob. I'll reject his offer and try to counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $110 is still a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

Bob has come up to $105, which is close to my desired price and a significant improvement on his previous offer. Accepting his offer will get me a good deal and avoid further negotiation."
