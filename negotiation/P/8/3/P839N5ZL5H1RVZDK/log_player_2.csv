"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1400000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its value to you and more than my minimum. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than John's price, there's room for negotiation to potentially get a better deal.  Bob can counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm hoping for a price closer to $1,250,000. It's still a significant gain for you and within my budget. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1250000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1325000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it keeps the deal moving forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,325,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000, and still provides Alice with a profit of $125,000.  There's a chance that Bob could continue negotiating and potentially get a slightly lower price, but the risk of losing the deal to John makes accepting Alice's offer the most sensible choice."
