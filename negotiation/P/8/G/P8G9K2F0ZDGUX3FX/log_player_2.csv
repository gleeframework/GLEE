"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm initially offering it to you for $2,000,000. I'm open to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is way too high, exceeding my maximum budget.  I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  while I see the value in this product, $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and allows for some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you offering a starting point. However, $1,300,000 is considerably lower than I believe this product is worth.  To be fair to both of us, I could consider a price of $1,800,000. This reflects the true value of the product while still acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still too high, although it's a step in the right direction.  I'm going to reject it and continue negotiating.  The price from John is my safety net if we don't reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $1,800,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and it's closer to your last offer.  Let's work together to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your commitment to finding a solution is appreciated. Let's aim for a win-win. How about we settle on $1,650,000? This represents a significant compromise on my part and keeps us moving towards a mutually agreeable outcome. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still too high.  I'm going to reject it and see if we can find a price closer to $1,450,000 in the next round. If we can't reach a deal, I have the option of buying from John, so I'm not desperate."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,650,000 is still above my budget.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to offer $1,500,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and it's a fair compromise given the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
