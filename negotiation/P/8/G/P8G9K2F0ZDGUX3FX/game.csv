"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm initially offering it to you for $2,000,000. I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  while I see the value in this product, $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and allows for some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you offering a starting point. However, $1,300,000 is considerably lower than I believe this product is worth.  To be fair to both of us, I could consider a price of $1,800,000. This reflects the true value of the product while still acknowledging your interest.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $1,800,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and it's closer to your last offer.  Let's work together to close this deal.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, your commitment to finding a solution is appreciated. Let's aim for a win-win. How about we settle on $1,650,000? This represents a significant compromise on my part and keeps us moving towards a mutually agreeable outcome.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,650,000 is still above my budget.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to offer $1,500,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and it's a fair compromise given the value of the product.  What do you think?",1500000.0,Bob,6,
