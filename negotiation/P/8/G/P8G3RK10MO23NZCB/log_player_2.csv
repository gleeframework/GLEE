Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, my absolute maximum. If you're open to that, we can close the deal. Otherwise, I'll need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is your final offer, matching your maximum budget.  You've stated your position clearly and given Alice a clear decision point. It also reinforces that you're willing to walk away if this deal doesn't work out."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty, Bob, but I'm not willing to go down to $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $1,000,000, so I'm offering you the product for $1,025,000. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, her offer is still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. You've already made your final counteroffer, and there's a good chance further negotiation won't get you a better price.  Buying from John at $1,000,000 ensures you get the product within your budget and avoids potentially losing more time and effort in negotiation."
