"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Since Alice is offering the product for the exact same price as John, you can reject her offer and still get the product from John for the same price. This strategy doesn't save you any money, but it avoids unnecessary negotiation."
