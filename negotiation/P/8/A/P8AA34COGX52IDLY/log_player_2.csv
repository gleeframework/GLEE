Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $600,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price that still reflects the product's worth.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $700,000 is still not enough for me to consider selling the product. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $850,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

It's time to cut bait and go with John.  Here's why:

* **Alice is unlikely to budge:** She's framed $850,000 as her ""final offer"" and her previous concessions were relatively small.
* **John's price is your target:**  You're aiming for $800,000 or less, and John provides that with no negotiation hassle.
* **Further haggling is risky:**  You only have a few rounds left. Pushing Alice further might make her dig in, leaving you with no deal and forced to go with John anyway."
