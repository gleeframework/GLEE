"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $18,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is the maximum I can afford right now. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $16,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to you.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $12,000. This is my absolute maximum, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're firm on your offer of $12,000, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be at least at $14,000 to make it worth my while. This is my final offer for now, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still a bit above what I can afford. I'm going to stick with my offer of $12,000. It's a fair price, and I'm confident that you'll find another buyer willing to pay closer to your asking price. If you're not willing to accept this offer, I'm going to have to move on to another seller.",12000.0,Bob,6,
