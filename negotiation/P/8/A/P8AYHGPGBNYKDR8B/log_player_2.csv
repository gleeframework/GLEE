"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll try to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider selling it for $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($8,000) than Alice's initial price ($12,000). This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Polite and Reasonable:** My message is polite and acknowledges Alice's offer. I'm also providing a reason for my counteroffer (budget limitations), which might make Alice more receptive. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  My goal is to acquire the product for a price closer to my limit ($10,000). By starting low, I'm hoping to meet Alice somewhere in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $10,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my limit, but I can still try to push for a better price.  I'm willing to go slightly above John's price to see if I can get a deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. How about we settle at $9,500? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  I'm aiming to split the difference between her latest offer ($10,500) and my previous counteroffer ($8,000).  
* **Compromise:** My message emphasizes that this is a fair compromise for both parties.
* **Nearing the Limit:**  I'm getting close to my upper limit ($10,000), but I believe there's still a chance to negotiate a slightly better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $9,500. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I think $11,000 is the lowest I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice seems firm on a price that's above my budget.  It's unlikely she'll go much lower than $11,000. To avoid further back-and-forth and potentially losing out on the product entirely, it's time to buy from John for $10,000. This ensures I get the product at the best possible price for me."
