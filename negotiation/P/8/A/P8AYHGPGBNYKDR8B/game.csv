"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider selling it for $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $10,500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. How about we settle at $9,500? That's a fair compromise.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $9,500. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I think $11,000 is the lowest I can go. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
