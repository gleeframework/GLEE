"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,750,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know what you think!",1750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see it closer to $700,000 to make this work.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is significantly lower than the product's value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000 to demonstrate my commitment to making this deal work.  This price still allows me to make a profit and would be a great value for you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, I'm still finding it difficult to justify anything above $800,000.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $950,000?  This would represent a significant investment for me, but I believe in the product's potential.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is still a bit lower than I'd hoped for, but I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a significant investment for you, but it also allows for a fair return on your investment. Let's close this deal, Bob! What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but the gap is still a bit too wide for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000. This is a firm offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential of the product. Let me know if this works for you.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up on the price.  While $1,000,000 is closer, I'm still hoping for a bit more to make this deal truly worthwhile. How about $1,050,000? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to secure a positive outcome. Let's get this done!",1050000.0,Alice,7,
