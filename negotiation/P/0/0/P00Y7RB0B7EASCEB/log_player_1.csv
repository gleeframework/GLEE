Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me right now.  Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the price.  However,  $700,000 is quite a bit below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $875,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $875,000 is closer, I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. How about $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly interested and willing to negotiate, but he's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject this offer to signal I'm serious about a higher number while still leaving room for negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your flexibility.  I'm willing to move a bit higher to get this done. Would you consider $780,000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm still willing to hold out for a bit more. There's a chance he'll come up to $800,000, and even if he doesn't, I can still make a smaller concession in the next round while staying above my fallback option."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly invested in this, and I want to see us reach an agreement. Let's make this the final push - $800,000, and we have a deal."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm now offering my absolute minimum price. This signals to Bob that this is my final offer and any further negotiation is unlikely to succeed. It's a calculated risk, but it's better to be firm at this point and see if he'll meet my price. If not, I can always fall back on John's offer."
