Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $175. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Not Too High:**  While we want to maximize profit, setting the price too high (like $250) might make Bob immediately walk away. $175 is a reasonable markup that still keeps the price within Bob's potential valuation. 
* **Positive Messaging:**  The message focuses on value rather than just the price, aiming to make the offer more appealing. 
 
**Important Note:**  There's a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you don't lose anything by aiming higher with Bob."
