Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale. I think it's really valuable, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts on a fair price. What do you think a good starting point would be?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I begin with a price higher than my minimum ($100) and Bob's perceived value ($80). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Open-ended Question:**  By asking Bob for his thoughts on a ""fair price,"" I encourage him to engage in the negotiation instead of just saying ""yes"" or ""no.""
* **Appear Flexible:** While I start high, my tone suggests willingness to negotiate, which might make Bob more receptive. 
 
**Strategy:**

My goal is to gather information about Bob's willingness to pay. Based on his counteroffer, I can decide whether to:

* **Continue Negotiating:** If Bob's offer is reasonably close to my minimum, I'll negotiate further.
* **Accept John's Offer:** If Bob's offer is too low, I'll take the guaranteed $100 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I believe we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $95 is a significant jump from his perceived value of $80. This indicates he's quite interested in the product. While $95 is a decent price, I believe I can still push for a bit more before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $95 is still lower than I'd like. How about we meet in the middle at $105?"",
""product_price"": 105
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** I acknowledge Bob's offer and signal willingness to negotiate by lowering my initial price. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  $105 keeps me above my minimum while being closer to Bob's counteroffer, potentially encouraging him to move closer to my desired range.
* **Maintain Value:** My messaging still implies the product is worth more than his offer, hoping he might increase his price further.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a compromise above my minimum.  If Bob rejects this and doesn't offer a significant increase, I'll likely accept John's $100 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see where you're coming from, Alice. Let's try $100 instead. That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has met my minimum acceptable price of $100. There's no benefit to rejecting this offer and potentially getting a lower counteroffer in the next round, or selling to John for the same price."
