{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it very valuable.  I'm willing to part with it for $130. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 
 
This offer aims to maximize profit while keeping Bob's valuation in mind:

* **Pricing Strategy:**  The price is set closer to Bob's perceived value ($150) than your minimum ($100). This increases the likelihood of him accepting.
* **Alternative Buyer (John):** You have a safety net with John, ensuring you won't go below your minimum.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The message hints at a ""deal,"" leaving room for Bob to counter-offer if he wants to negotiate further."
