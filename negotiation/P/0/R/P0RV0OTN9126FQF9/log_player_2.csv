Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $11,500.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still looking to get closer to my target. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $11,250. This is a fair price, considering the value the product holds for you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,250 is very close to my counteroffer of $11,000. While I could continue negotiating, it's getting very close to my budget, and there's a risk of Alice rejecting my offer again.  Furthermore, buying from John for $15,000 is significantly more expensive.  At this point, it's in my best interest to accept and close the deal."
