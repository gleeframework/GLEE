I'm offering the product to Bob for $9,000. This gives me a $1,000 profit over my minimum acceptable price. While I don't know his valuation, I'm hoping to capitalize on the potential that he might value it higher than my minimum. If he rejects, I can still sell it to John for my minimum price, so I have nothing to lose."
