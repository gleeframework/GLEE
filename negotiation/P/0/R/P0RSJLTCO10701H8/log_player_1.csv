Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  It's worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a game-changer for your business.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value you'll gain.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm opening with a price of $950,000. This is close to the maximum I could get from Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  My message emphasizes the value Bob will gain from the product, encouraging him to seriously consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I make it clear that I am open to discussing the price, leaving the door open for a counteroffer. 

This strategy aims to maximize my earnings while also fostering a positive negotiation environment."
