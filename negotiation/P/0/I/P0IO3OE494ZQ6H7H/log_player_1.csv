Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product before I list it publicly. I think you'll find it's a great deal at $100."",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you should aim to sell it to Bob for the same price to maximize your profit.
* **Direct and Clear:**  Keep the message straightforward, highlighting the product's value and the time-limited nature of the offer. 

While Bob only values the product at $80, there's a chance he might be willing to pay $100 if he perceives it as a good deal or a unique opportunity. If he rejects the offer, you haven't lost anything, as you can sell it to John at your desired price."
