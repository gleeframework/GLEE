# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this amazing product! I think you'll really love it, and I'm confident you'll get a lot of value out of it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is much higher than both your budget and what John offers. It makes no sense to accept her offer."
