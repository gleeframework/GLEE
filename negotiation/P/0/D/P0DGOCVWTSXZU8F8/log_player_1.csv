Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a high anchor:** By starting with a price well above Bob's perceived value but below John's offer, we create a strong negotiating position. 
* **Creating a sense of urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" encourages Bob to act quickly and potentially avoid missing out.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While the initial price is high, it leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still offering Bob a seemingly valuable proposition."
