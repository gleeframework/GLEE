"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I believe this price is fair and reasonable, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with your decision. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Even though Alice's offer is lower than her product's value to her, it's still significantly more than your maximum budget and what John offers. Buying from John saves you the most money."
