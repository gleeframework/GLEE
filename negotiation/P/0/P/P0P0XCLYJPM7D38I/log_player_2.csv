"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is worth $150 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $140. This is a great opportunity to save $10 on the original value. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is a good start, but there's still room for negotiation. I'm aiming to get the product for a lower price, so I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider lowering the price to $120?"",

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, and I'd like to accommodate you as much as possible. I'm now offering the product at $130. This is a $20 discount from its original value, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down on the price, which is a good sign. However, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll continue to counter-offer in the hopes of securing a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for getting back to me, Alice. I'm getting closer to your price point, but $130 is still a tad high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $125?"",
""product_price"": 125
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your patience, Bob. I'm glad we're making progress. Considering your feedback, I'm willing to offer the product at $127.50. It's a $22.50 discount from its original value, and I hope this meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $127.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly trying to find a middle ground, and $127.50 is a reasonable compromise. It's a good discount from the original price, and continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better outcome."
