"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95. I think it's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!",95.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $85 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product for you.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we try $87.50? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product for me.",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $87.50 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for. I'm willing to come down to $89.  This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product and I think it will be mutually beneficial.  Let's reach an agreement on this one.",89.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $89. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we try $88? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product for me.",88.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point, but $88 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of the product and how much time we've spent negotiating, I'm willing to meet you in the middle again at $88.50.  This is my final offer. Let's get this done!",88.5,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $88.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we try $87? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product for me.",87.0,Bob,8,
