"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get a little closer to my asking price.  How about we settle on $11,000? This would still be a good deal for you, considering the value you've mentioned, and it's a step closer to where I need to be. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. While $10,500 is a good offer, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the true value of the product. I'm willing to come down to $10,750. This is a small step closer to your offer, but I believe it's fair considering the benefits this product will provide you. Let's see if we can make this happen.",10750.0,Alice,5,
