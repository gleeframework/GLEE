"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $950,000 is a good starting point, it doesn't reflect the true value of what I'm offering. I'm willing to come down a bit further and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the potential benefits you'll receive. Let's work together to finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
