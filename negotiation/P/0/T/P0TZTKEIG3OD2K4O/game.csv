"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,400,000. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me.  What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my minimum price. What are your thoughts?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,350,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000.  This reflects the product's value to me, and it's the best I can do at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I can see you're willing to meet me halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,420,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finalize the deal here.",1420000.0,Alice,5,
