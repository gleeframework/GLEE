"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, given its value to me. I'm open to further discussion.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, Bob. However, I believe the product's value is worth more than $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're not seeing eye to eye on the price, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make a living. I'm thinking more along the lines of $10,500. What do you think is a fair price for this amazing product?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $10,500 is still too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and it shows I'm serious about buying your product.  Let's make this deal happen.",9000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm not ready to give up on getting a better price yet. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think is a fair price for this incredible product?",9500.0,Alice,7,
