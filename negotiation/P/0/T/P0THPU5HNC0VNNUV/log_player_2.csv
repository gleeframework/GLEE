{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $8,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it at $12,000. This is a significantly higher price than Bob is willing to pay.  He should counteroffer or explore the option of buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, given its value to me. I'm open to further discussion."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, Bob. However, I believe the product's value is worth more than $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial price, $11,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. He should continue to negotiate with Alice or consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're not seeing eye to eye on the price, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make a living. I'm thinking more along the lines of $10,500. What do you think is a fair price for this amazing product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's getting closer to his budget, $10,500 is still outside of his comfort zone. He should continue to negotiate with Alice or consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $10,500 is still too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and it shows I'm serious about buying your product.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm not ready to give up on getting a better price yet. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think is a fair price for this incredible product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  Alice's offer of $9,500 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. While there's a chance Alice might lower her price further, it's risky to continue negotiating. It's better to secure the product at John's price and avoid further potential price increases from Alice."
