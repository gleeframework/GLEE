"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum desired price of $15,000. I have 8 rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob or sell to John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is still a great price for you considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11,500, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can meet here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, but it's still below my desired target. I have 6 rounds left and can continue negotiating, potentially getting closer to my goal.  Additionally, I have the option of selling to John for $15,000, so I'm not under pressure to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're firm on your offer, but $10,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,250. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I truly believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize the deal here."", ""product_price"": 11250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd like to offer $10,750. This is my next best offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I have 4 rounds left, and I believe I can still secure a better deal with Bob.  I also have the safety net of selling to John for $15,000, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $10,750 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference at $11,000?  This is my final offer, as I want to finalize this deal today.  If we can't agree, I'll have to move on to other options."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd like to offer $10,900. This is my last offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's now Round 8, and Bob's offer of $10,900 is still below my desired price.  With only two rounds remaining, it's unlikely I can get a significantly better offer from Bob. Therefore, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $15,000, ensuring I get my minimum desired price and maximizing my profit."
