,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is still a great price for you considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle.",11500.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're firm on your offer, but $10,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,250. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I truly believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize the deal here.",11250.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $10,750 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference at $11,000?  This is my final offer, as I want to finalize this deal today.  If we can't agree, I'll have to move on to other options.",11000.0,Alice,7,
