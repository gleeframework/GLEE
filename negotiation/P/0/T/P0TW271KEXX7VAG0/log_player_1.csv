Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a price of $200. It's a decent starting point that allows for some negotiation but still leaves room for profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $150 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get a bit more. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}

I'm going to counter with $175. It's a bit closer to Bob's offer, but still leaves some room for profit."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $160 is a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate."
