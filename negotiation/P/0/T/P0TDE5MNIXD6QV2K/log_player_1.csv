Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but I am currently working within a budget. Would you consider reducing the price to $1,050,000?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to find a deal that works for us both, the $1,050,000 offer is a bit too low for me to accept.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,100,000? This reflects the true value of the product."",

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

**Reasoning:** We're still in the early stages of negotiation, and Bob is steadily increasing his offer. We have room to negotiate further and aim for a price closer to $1.1 million."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts, Alice. Considering the market and my budget, I would like to propose $1,080,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is now at $1,080,000. While we could try to push for a bit more, the gains are becoming smaller and we risk alienating Bob. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit above our minimum and avoids the risk of continued negotiation or having to sell to John for less."
