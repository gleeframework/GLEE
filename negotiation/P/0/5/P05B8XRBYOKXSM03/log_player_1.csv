{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of significant value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering its potential. Please let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Initial offer:** I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer in a way that highlights the potential value of the product for Bob, making it more attractive to him.
* **Next steps:** I will observe Bob's reaction. If he rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a new offer. If the negotiations go nowhere, I can always fall back on John's guaranteed $1,000,000 offer."
