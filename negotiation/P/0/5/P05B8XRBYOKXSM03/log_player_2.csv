"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of significant value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. This is a fair price considering its potential. Please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You don't know the true value of the product to Alice. Rejecting the offer allows you to gather more information. You can counteroffer with a lower price to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. This gives you a better understanding of the product's potential value and helps you save money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $1000000 is a good starting point, I believe the true value of this product lies closer to my initial offer. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This price still reflects the unique benefits of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has already lowered her price from $1,500,000 to $1,250,000. This shows she's willing to negotiate. By rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer, you can potentially drive the price down further. You still have the option to buy from John for $1,500,000, so you're not losing anything by continuing to negotiate."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,250,000 is closer to what I'm comfortable with, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,100,000?  This would be a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while still giving me room to work with.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
