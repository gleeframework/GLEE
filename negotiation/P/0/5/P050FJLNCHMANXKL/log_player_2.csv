"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than the product's value to her ($12,000 vs $10,000).** This means there's room for negotiation.
* **You can get the product for $15,000 from John.**  This sets a clear upper limit for what you're willing to pay. 
* **Rejecting allows you to counteroffer and potentially get a better price.**  

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to bring the price down closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is below Alice's offer but above her value.** This shows a willingness to negotiate while also leaving room for Alice to make a concession.
* **It's closer to your desired price range** than Alice's original offer. 
* **You have the option to go with John at $15,000** which provides leverage in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is higher than her previous offer and closer to John's price.** This indicates she is less flexible and might not be willing to negotiate much further. 
* **However, you still have leverage.**  You can still get a better deal from John, so you can afford to be patient and keep trying to negotiate.

By rejecting again, you can:

* **Signal that you are serious about getting a better price.**
* **Try a slightly lower counteroffer to see if you can find a compromise.** 
* **If Alice continues to be inflexible, you always have the option to go with John.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is slightly higher than your previous offer, but still below Alice's.**  This shows a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a lower price.
* **It's closer to your desired price range.**
* **You have the option to go with John at $15,000, giving you leverage.**  You can afford to reject Alice's offer if she doesn't come down further. 

This counteroffer is a strategic move to see if you can find a middle ground before moving on to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is becoming less flexible.** Her counteroffers are creeping closer to your upper limit, indicating she might be unwilling to drop much lower.
* **Her latest offer is only slightly better than John's price.** The difference is not worth the potential risk of continuing the negotiation.
* **You have a reliable alternative.** You can get the product from John for $15,000, which is only $2,000 more than Alice's last offer.

At this point, it's more efficient to secure the product from John. You've established a good negotiation range, but the risk of continuing with Alice is not worth the potential reward."
