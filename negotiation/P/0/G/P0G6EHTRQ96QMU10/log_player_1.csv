Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I'm anticipating, I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Starting High:**  A higher initial offer leaves room for negotiation. While $15,000 is ambitious, it tests Bob's willingness to pay a premium. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's value and potential demand to justify the high price.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you're comfortable with the possibility of Bob rejecting the offer and selling to John at $12,000."
