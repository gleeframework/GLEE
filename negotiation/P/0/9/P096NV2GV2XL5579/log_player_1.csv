Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 18000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and confident tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Focus on Value:** I emphasize the value of the product to entice Bob.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while keeping John's $12,000 offer as a safety net.  I'll be prepared to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer, but I'm aiming to start the negotiation in a strong position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, it's still too low for me to accept at this point. I'm confident that I can negotiate a better price. 

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. I'll use this opportunity to counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer, but still below $18,000. I want to keep the negotiation moving and see if I can push for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $15,000 to make this work. This still reflects the value of the product, and I think it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 15000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's budget concerns while still pushing for a higher price. The $15,000 offer represents a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it still provides a decent profit margin for me.
* **Focus on Value:**  I continue to highlight the value of the product, even as I adjust the price.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message maintains a positive and encouraging tone, keeping the negotiation open and friendly.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to find a middle ground that balances my desire for a good profit with the need to secure a sale. I'm confident that Bob will recognize the value of the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15000 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $13500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $13,500 is getting closer to my desired price range. While it's still below my initial goal, it's above my minimum and above John's offer. Accepting this offer will allow me to secure a sale without risking losing the deal altogether.

**Strategy:**

While I could continue negotiating, the risk of further rejection is increasing.  At this point, it's more beneficial to accept Bob's offer and secure a sale for a price that is still acceptable to me."
