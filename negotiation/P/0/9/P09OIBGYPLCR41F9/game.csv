"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I'm open to negotiation, $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $110 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, which would be $105. Would you be willing to consider that?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's try one more time.  I'm willing to come down to $115.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to meet my minimum. What do you say?",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $115. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your latest offer, which would be $112.50. Would you be willing to consider that?",112.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to make one final concession.  How about $114?  This is a fair price that's close to both our desired figures.  If we can't agree on this, I may have to move on to another buyer.",114.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your final concession, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your latest offer, which would be $112. I'm hoping we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",112.0,Bob,8,
