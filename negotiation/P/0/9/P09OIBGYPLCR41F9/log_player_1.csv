"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $140. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
While $100 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum threshold of $120.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I'm open to negotiation, $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $110 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, which would be $105. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $105 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price.  I'm willing to keep negotiating, hoping we can reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's try one more time.  I'm willing to come down to $115.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to meet my minimum. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $115. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your latest offer, which would be $112.50. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $112.5 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price.  I'm not quite ready to sell to John yet, as I believe we can still reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to make one final concession.  How about $114?  This is a fair price that's close to both our desired figures.  If we can't agree on this, I may have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 114}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your final concession, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your latest offer, which would be $112. I'm hoping we can find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum, but not quite there. With only two rounds remaining, I don't want to risk ending up with a lower price.  John is offering my minimum, so it's the most sensible option at this point."
