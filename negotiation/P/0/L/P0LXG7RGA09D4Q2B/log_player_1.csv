Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll be really interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$120** is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum price of $80, but also leaves room for negotiation and allows for a potential win-win scenario.
* The message is friendly and non-aggressive, aiming to start the negotiation on a positive note. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum price, $90 is still significantly less than the $120 you initially offered.  There is still room for negotiation.  By rejecting Bob's offer, you can try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $90 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my original asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $105? "", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This approach shows a willingness to compromise while still securing a price above your minimum. 
* **Positive message:**  The message remains friendly and positive, aiming to keep the negotiation going. 

Let's see if Bob will accept this counteroffer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. How about $92.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $92.50 is very close to your minimum price of $80. While you could potentially continue negotiating, the risk of Bob walking away or you needing to sell to John for $80 is high. Accepting the offer ensures a quick sale and a decent profit."
