"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 200} 

I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $80. This leaves room for negotiation and hopefully secures a good price for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd like to get more, Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price.  It's better to close the deal now than risk further negotiation and potentially lose out to John."
