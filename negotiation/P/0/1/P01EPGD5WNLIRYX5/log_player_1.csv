"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $8,000 for it. Could we possibly come to an agreement closer to that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I still feel that $8,000 would be a fair price for this product. Could we possibly meet at this amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000.

Bob is firmly rooted at $8,000.  It's unlikely further negotiation will result in a significantly better offer.  Accepting John's offer ensures I get the minimum acceptable price."
