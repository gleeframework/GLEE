{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. How about $10,500?  I'm really interested in this product, but I'm on a tight budget."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11000? It's a fair price, and I think you'll still be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save money, and Alice's offer is still higher than his target price. There's still room for negotiation, so Bob should reject the offer and try to get a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a bit over budget.  Would you consider $10,750? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $11200. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target price, there's still a chance to negotiate further and get a better deal.  Bob is still within his budget, and with several rounds left, it's worth trying to get a lower price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit too high. Would you be willing to go down to $10,900?  I'm really eager to get this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10900}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,100

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit over budget at $11,100. Would you consider $10,950?  I believe this price is fair for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10950}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $11050. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. How about we compromise at $11050? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,050.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,050
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has only one round left to negotiate with Alice.  While he would prefer a lower price, it's getting increasingly unlikely that Alice will go lower.  Accepting Alice's offer at $11,050 is a good compromise, especially considering that John is selling the product for $12,000."
