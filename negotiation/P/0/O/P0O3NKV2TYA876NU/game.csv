"Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $10000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $10000 seems a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $6000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $6000 is unfortunately too far below what I can accept.  I'm willing to come down to $8500, which still reflects the value of this unique item. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $8500, but I'm still not sure if it's a good fit for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $7250. Can you consider that?",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $7750, which is a significant price reduction.  I hope this meets your needs and we can finalise this deal.",7750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $7750, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, so I'll offer $7375. Can you consider that?",7375.0,Bob,6,
