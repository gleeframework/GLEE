{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($8,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  Using a positive and enthusiastic tone might make Bob more willing to engage.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm not giving away specifics about the product, but I'm emphasizing its potential value to Bob. This could pique his interest. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Observe Bob's Reaction:** If Bob rejects, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing to negotiate with him.
* **John's Offer:** I'll keep John's $8,000 offer in mind as a safety net if the negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10000 seems a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $6000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $6,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, he's shown interest in the product.  This means there's potential for further negotiation.
* **Higher Counteroffer:**  I'll make a counteroffer closer to my minimum to see if I can reach a compromise.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'll send a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price, perhaps something like $8,500.
* **John's Offer:**  I'll keep John's offer in mind as a backup option if negotiations with Bob break down."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $6,000 is unfortunately too far below what I can accept.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which still reflects the value of this unique item. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer Closer to Minimum:** I'm moving closer to my minimum price of $8,000, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is unique and has value, hoping to justify my price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm using language like ""find a middle ground"" to encourage further discussion and potential compromise.

**Next Steps:**

* **Assess Bob's Response:**  I'll carefully analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer.
* **John's Offer:**  I'll keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $8500, but I'm still not sure if it's a good fit for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $7250. Can you consider that?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below $8,000. I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum price.
* **Potential for Compromise:**  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate and is closer to my desired price. This suggests there's still room for further compromise.
* **Counter Offer:**  I'll counter with a price that's closer to my minimum, but still higher than Bob's offer. This will continue to show that I'm willing to negotiate while ensuring I don't sell for less than my minimum.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'll send a counteroffer, perhaps something like $7,750.
* **John's Offer:**  I'll keep John's offer in mind as a backup option in case negotiations with Bob ultimately fail."

Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, it's still below $8,000.  
* **Negotiations Stalled:**  We've been going back and forth, and Bob's counteroffers are consistently lower than my minimum.  This suggests that further negotiation is unlikely to yield a higher price.
* **John's Offer is a Safe Bet:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price of $8,000. It's a reliable option that avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob that could potentially result in a lower price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Inform Bob:** I'll politely inform Bob that I've decided to sell to another buyer.
* **Sell to John:**  I'll finalize the sale with John at $8,000."
