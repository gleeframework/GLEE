"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I'm confident that this price reflects the significant return on investment you'll experience."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with an ambitious offer significantly above both my minimum price and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value"" and ""potential for return on investment."" This framing aims to justify the high initial price. 
* **Alternative Option:**  While I have John as a backup, it's too early to settle for my minimum price. I want to explore if I can maximize my profit with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the opportunity to consider your product. I understand the value you're offering, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000. I believe this aligns closer to the value I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price, I still have room to negotiate. I'll aim to meet somewhere in the middle during the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a price of $1,875,000. I believe this reflects a fair compromise while still recognizing the significant value this product brings."",
""product_price"": 1875000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I've moved closer to the middle ground between my initial offer ($2,250,000) and Bob's offer ($1,500,000). 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes finding a ""fair compromise"" while still highlighting the product's value.
* **Time Consideration:** I'm mindful that we have limited rounds, so I'm making a more substantial move to encourage agreement."

Round 4

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly moving towards my price range, but I believe there's still some room for negotiation. It's worth risking another round to see if I can get closer to $1,750,000.  I'll make a smaller concession this time to signal that I'm getting closer to my bottom line."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,812,500.  I believe this offer represents a very fair deal considering the value you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1812500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** I've reduced my price by a smaller amount ($62,500) this round to show I'm getting closer to my limit.
* **Value Focus:** The message continues to emphasize the value proposition to keep Bob engaged.
* **Time Pressure:**  We're over halfway through the negotiation rounds, so I'm aiming to close the deal soon."

{

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,750,000 is a significant profit above my minimum.

* **Time Value:** Closing the deal now avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the negotiation reaching an impasse."
