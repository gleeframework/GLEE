Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Bob's offer is getting very close to my minimum price of $8,000, and I'm confident that I won't get a better offer in the remaining rounds. It's better to accept his offer now and secure a deal than risk losing him and having to sell to John for a lower price."
