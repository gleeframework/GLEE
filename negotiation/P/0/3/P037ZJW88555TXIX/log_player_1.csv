Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only offer $12,000 right now.  Let's see if we can find common ground.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}"
