"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great price considering its value to you, and it leaves room for both of us to make a profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. How about $600,000? That feels like a fairer price that still gives you a good return."",
""product_price"": 600000
}
```

Here's why this counteroffer makes sense:

* **Ambitious but realistic:** Starting significantly lower than Alice's offer shows you're serious about getting a good deal.  $600,000 is still a substantial profit for Alice if her value is $1,200,000.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  This counteroffer opens space for Alice to counter, and for you to potentially meet somewhere in the middle. 
* **Time pressure:** By making a bold counteroffer, we're subtly reminding Alice that we have other options (John) without explicitly saying it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is far too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $800,000, which is a fair compromise given your potential profit. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met our reservation price of $800,000. There's no point in rejecting and trying to negotiate further, as we can buy the product from John at this price anyway. Accepting now secures the deal."
