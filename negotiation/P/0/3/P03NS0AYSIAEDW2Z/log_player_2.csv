"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. I think this is a great deal, considering its value to you is likely much higher. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $9,000 is above his maximum budget, and there's room for negotiation. He should try to get a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $9,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $9000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. Considering your offer of $7500, I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8250. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, he can still potentially get a better deal.  He should try to negotiate a lower price, especially since he has the option of buying from John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $8,250 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $8,000, which is my absolute maximum.  Let me know if you're willing to accept that."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $8000 is your maximum, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. Considering your offer, I'm willing to go down to $8150. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  While Alice's offer of $8,150 is getting closer, Bob can get the product from John for $8,000. There's no guarantee he'll be able to negotiate Alice down to that price, and with only 5 rounds left, it's too risky.  It's time to secure the deal with John."
