"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I see the value, but I need a price that works for both of us. How about we settle around $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. To be honest, my budget is closer to $950,000. If you're able to work with that, I'm ready to close the deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $950,000. I'll give you a bit more wiggle room, but I need to stay close to my minimum. How about we settle at $1,020,000?",1020000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close. I can tell this product is important to you, and I'm willing to bump my offer to $975,000. That's my best and final offer. Let me know if we have a deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your best and final offer, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $975,000. I'll give you a bit more to think about, but I need to stay firm on my minimum. How about we settle at $1,050,000? This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not acceptable to you.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
