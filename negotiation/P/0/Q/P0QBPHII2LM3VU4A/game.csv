"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price. I'm offering the product to you for $2000000.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $2000000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1300000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I see in it, and it's within my budget. What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was expecting a bit more enthusiasm for this product. Considering its value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1800000.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1800000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm committed to making this happen, but I can't go above $1500000.  This is the maximum I can offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we've discussed.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad to see you're still interested in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1500000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm now offering the product to you for $1700000. This is a reasonable price, considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1700000 is still too high for me. I'm committed to acquiring this product, but my budget simply won't allow for that. I'm willing to go to $1600000, which is a significant compromise on my end. Let's bridge the gap and finalize this deal.",1600000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're getting closer to an agreement. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1600000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1700000 and $1600000, which would be $1650000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can conclude the deal at this price.",1650000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1650000.  It's a good sign we're close to an agreement. However, my budget is fixed at $1500000.  To finalize this deal, I'm offering my final price, which is also my maximum: $1500000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had. Let's close this deal now.",1500000.0,Bob,8,
