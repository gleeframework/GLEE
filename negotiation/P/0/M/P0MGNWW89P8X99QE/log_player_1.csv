"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'm hoping to entice him with a reasonable offer while still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation. I'm hoping to find a middle ground where we both benefit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,200,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it still leaves me with a profit. I believe this price is fair and will encourage Bob to continue the negotiation."
