"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $900,000 doesn't quite cover the value of this product. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the benefits you'll gain from owning it. Let's close this deal!",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, your offer is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there.  I value this product highly, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits it offers.  How about we meet at $1,025,000? This is a fair compromise that recognizes both our needs.  Let's make this happen!",1025000.0,Alice,5,
