"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,300,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
 
Alice's starting price is higher than both your ideal price and John's offer. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?"", ""product_price"": 1100000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with a lower offer than your ideal price. This leaves room for bargaining and finding a middle ground.
* **Significant Difference:** The difference between Alice's starting price ($1,300,000) and your counteroffer ($1,100,000) is substantial enough to potentially pique her interest while still leaving you room to negotiate upwards if needed.
* **Below John's Offer:** Your counteroffer remains below John's $1,500,000, ensuring you have a backup option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you think the initial price was a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $1,250,000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Alice's offer has come down, it's still above her own valuation of the product ($1,200,000). This indicates there's likely still room for her to go lower.
* **Close to John's Offer:** At $1,250,000, Alice's offer is getting uncomfortably close to John's $1,500,000 price.  It's worth seeing if you can get closer to your target price before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we settle at $1,175,000?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"", ""product_price"": 1175000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground between your previous offer ($1,100,000) and Alice's current price ($1,250,000). 
* **Signaling Seriousness:** By increasing your offer, you demonstrate to Alice that you're serious about buying but are still seeking a reasonable price.
* **Staying Below John:**  Your counteroffer remains below John's price, preserving your alternative option if negotiations stall."
