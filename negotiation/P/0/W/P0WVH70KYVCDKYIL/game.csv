"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me, and it gives us both a good deal. Let's see if we can work something out.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $750,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price still offers you a significant value, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $850,000, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to pay $825,000 for the product, which is a fair price and still gives you a good profit. Let's get this deal done.",825000.0,Bob,4,
