I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. I'm also emphasizing the value to Bob, making the offer seem more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me, and it gives us both a good deal. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than $800,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $750,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price still offers you a significant value, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $850,000, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to pay $825,000 for the product, which is a fair price and still gives you a good profit. Let's get this deal done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $825,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm happy to accept this offer, as it's a good deal for both of us and secures a sale."
