"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I know you're interested in. I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) and slightly above what I think Bob might be willing to pay ($80). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Approach:**  I'm starting with a friendly message to build rapport. 
* **Direct Offer:** I'm making a clear offer with a specific price. 

**Important Note:** While I'm aiming for the highest price, I'm also aware that I have John as a backup buyer, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob doesn't meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** Even though it's closer to my minimum, it's still below the $100 I'm aiming for. 
* **Negotiation room:** I want to see if I can get Bob closer to my price. 
* **John as backup:**  I'm comfortable rejecting Bob's offer because I have the option to sell to John for $100. 

I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I'm taking a more moderate approach.  I'm not going all the way down to Bob's offer, but I'm showing flexibility.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I'm still above my minimum price ($100) and above the price John is offering ($100).
* **Positive Tone:** I'm trying to keep the conversation positive to encourage Bob to continue negotiating.

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to close the deal. If not, I'll keep negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $95, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Can you meet me at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $85 is below my minimum of $100. Even though we've negotiated a bit, it's unlikely Bob will budge much further. 
* **John's offer is guaranteed:** John is ready to pay my minimum. There's no risk of losing money by selling to John.
* **Limited Rounds:** We're already in Round 4, and time is running out. 

While I'd prefer to get a higher price, securing $100 from John is the safest and most efficient choice at this point."
