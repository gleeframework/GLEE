At this point, Bob's offer is getting very close to my target price. While I could push for a bit more, there's a risk he might significantly lower his offer in the next round or walk away.  Accepting his offer of $1,255,000 ensures a good profit and minimizes the risk of losing the sale to John for a much lower price."
