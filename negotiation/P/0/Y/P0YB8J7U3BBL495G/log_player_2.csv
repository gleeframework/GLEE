# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $11,000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further. I can sell the product to you for $10,500. It's still a great price, and I think you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $10,000. It's in Bob's best interest to take the guaranteed deal from John at $10,000 rather than risk further negotiation with Alice."
