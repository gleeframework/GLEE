"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this is a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I'm considering Alice's offer of $14,500. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I will reject Alice's offer because I can get the same product from John for $15,000, which is still within my budget.
