Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $800,000.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $800,000 to him. 
* **Your Alternative:** You have a guaranteed sale at $800,000 with John.

**Strategy**

Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at Bob's valuation, you have leverage.  You should aim to get more than $800,000 from Bob.  However, you need to balance this with the risk of Bob rejecting your offer.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $850,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring you."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Direct and Confident:**  The message is clear and straightforward about the offer.
* **Value-Based:** It subtly emphasizes the ""value"" of the product to justify the higher price.
* **Reasonable Markup:** The $50,000 markup is significant but not outrageous. It leaves room for Bob to negotiate if he wants, but still secures you a profit above your minimum.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is particularly tough in negotiations, you might slightly lower your initial price to provide more room for bargaining.
* **Market Context:**  If similar products are selling for significantly higher or lower, adjust accordingly.

**Remember:** This is just one approach.  Negotiation is dynamic, and you might need to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response."
