"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than $18,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're interested in a lower price, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $12,000 is a bit low for you, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $16,000. How about $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $15,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $15,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and $15,500. How about $14,750?",14750.0,Bob,6,
