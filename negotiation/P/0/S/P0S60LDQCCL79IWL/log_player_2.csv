It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice.  You're willing to pay up to $800,000, so there's room for a counteroffer."

Alice is coming down, but you can still try to get a better price.  You're willing to pay up to $800,000, so a counteroffer is still a good option."

Alice is still above your target price of $800,000.  While a counteroffer might be possible, you're running the risk of going back and forth.  At this point, it's more efficient to buy from John and avoid further negotiation."
