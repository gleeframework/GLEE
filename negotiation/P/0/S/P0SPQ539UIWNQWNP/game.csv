"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product for a one-time price of $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,500,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Given your value for the product,  I'd like to offer $1,050,000.  This is still a fair price for both of us, and lets me secure the product without exceeding my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,050,000. However, I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,225,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the fact that it's still a significant discount from its worth to you.",1225000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit over my target price.  I'm happy to go to $1,100,000, as this represents a fair compromise for both of us and keeps the deal within my budget. ",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, $1,100,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, which is the same price I offered initially. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you and the negotiations we've had so far.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
