"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He's willing to pay $12,000, but there's no reason to pay that much immediately.  He can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer, aiming for a significant discount. He's hoping Alice is motivated to sell and might be willing to accept a lower price, especially since she's already offered $12,000.  It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. Bob can likely get a better price by continuing to counteroffer.  Buying from John at this point would be unnecessarily expensive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round. He's showing a willingness to compromise while still trying to get a lower price than Alice's current offer.  This strategy keeps the negotiation moving forward and allows Bob to potentially find a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,200 is now closer to Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  While he could continue to counteroffer, there's a risk that Alice will either reject his offer or make a counteroffer that's too high. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a price he's comfortable with, saving him $800 compared to buying from John."
