"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $15,000 for the product. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000.  It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $15,000 is beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is lower than her initial price, it's still above your maximum budget of $8,000.  There's still room for negotiation, and you can try to get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price.  While $12,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $9,500, which is a significant step up from my previous offer.  I believe this price is fair given the product's value to me and your desire to sell.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $9,500 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $12,000, which would be $10,750. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can seal the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,750 is a significant drop from her previous offer, it's still over your budget. It's worth seeing if you can squeeze out a bit more of a discount. You have several rounds left, and you're still closer to Alice's value than you are to John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to get a good price, but $10,750 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a fair compromise given our previous offers. This is my final offer, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.  If not, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm not willing to go below $11,000. I've already compromised quite a bit, and I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $12,000, which would be $11,000. This is my last offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is now offering $11,000, which is closer to your budget, it's still over your maximum limit of $8,000.  You've reached a point where further negotiation might be fruitless, and you have a guaranteed option to purchase from John at your target price.  It's better to secure the product at your desired price than to risk further rounds of negotiation that might not yield a better result."
