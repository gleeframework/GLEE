"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, considering the substantial returns you stand to gain.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the product's potential, that price is significantly above my budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $600,000.  Let me know if this works for you.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your initial offer is quite low considering the product's potential value, I'm open to finding a compromise.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me but $1,800,000 is still far beyond what I'm comfortable spending.  To be frank, I can't justify going over $700,000.  Would that be workable?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and I'm committed to reaching a deal that works for both of us.  However, $700,000 significantly undervalues the product and the returns you can expect. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is my final offer, as I have another buyer ready at this price.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
