Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your initial offer is quite low considering the product's potential value, I'm open to finding a compromise.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,800,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000.

{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me but $1,800,000 is still far beyond what I'm comfortable spending.  To be frank, I can't justify going over $700,000.  Would that be workable?"",

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and I'm committed to reaching a deal that works for both of us.  However, $700,000 significantly undervalues the product and the returns you can expect. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is my final offer, as I have another buyer ready at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding firm at a price significantly higher than your maximum budget. Her claim of another buyer is a common negotiation tactic, and even if true, it doesn't change the fact that her offer doesn't meet your needs. Buying from John for $800,000 ensures you stay within your budget."
