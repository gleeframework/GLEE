"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a great deal to you, and I believe we can find a price that works for both of us. My starting offer is $1,200,000. Let's discuss!",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  Given its value to you, I'm willing to pay $950,000. This leaves room for profit for you and is a fair starting point for our negotiation. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects the value of the product to you, while still allowing me a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  Considering its value to you, I'm confident we can find a price that benefits us both. I'm willing to offer $975,000.  Let's aim for a win-win scenario here.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Given the unique value this product holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,012,500.  Let's make this happen. This is my final offer.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,012,500 is still a bit steep for me.  Considering its value to you, I believe we can find a more mutually beneficial price. I'm prepared to offer $990,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement. ",990000.0,Bob,6,
