"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  Given its value to you, I'm willing to pay $950,000. This leaves room for profit for you and is a fair starting point for our negotiation. Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects the value of the product to you, while still allowing me a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  Considering its value to you, I'm confident we can find a price that benefits us both. I'm willing to offer $975,000.  Let's aim for a win-win scenario here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Given the unique value this product holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,012,500.  Let's make this happen. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1012500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,012,500 is still a bit steep for me.  Considering its value to you, I believe we can find a more mutually beneficial price. I'm prepared to offer $990,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to continue negotiating, I'm running out of time and the risk of losing the deal entirely is high. Bob's offer of $990,000 is just above my minimum, and it's better than selling to John for $800,000. I'll accept his offer."
