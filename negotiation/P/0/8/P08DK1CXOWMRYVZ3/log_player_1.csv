"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This is a good starting point because it's above the product's value to Bob, but not so high that it makes him immediately reject the offer. I'm hoping this will entice him to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm rejecting it and will counter with a price closer to my initial offer.  I want to maximize my profit, and selling to John for $1,000,000 is always an option if I can't get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm countering with $1,100,000. This is still a good profit for me and it's closer to Bob's offer, potentially making him more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my desired price, it's still not enough to make it worthwhile. I'm hopeful that I can get a better price in the remaining rounds. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is still a viable option if negotiations with Bob don't pan out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

I'm going to drop my price a bit more to $1,050,000.  This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but I'm hoping it will be enough to incentivize Bob to accept. We're getting closer to the middle ground and I'm confident that with a few more rounds, we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has finally offered the price that the product is worth to him. I will accept his offer and sell the product for $1,000,000.  It's a good deal for both of us, and it allows me to close the deal without needing to go through further rounds of negotiations."
