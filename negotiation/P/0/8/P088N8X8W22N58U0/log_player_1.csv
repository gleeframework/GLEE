Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident I can get closer to my target value in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price, but I've already reached round 4 and I want to secure the best possible deal. Since John is willing to pay my desired price of $1,500,000, I'm going to sell the product to him. This avoids further negotiation and guarantees me the full value I want."
