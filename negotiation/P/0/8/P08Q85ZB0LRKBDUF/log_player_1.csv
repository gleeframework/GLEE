Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $119. I believe it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while staying above our minimum ($120). 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $119 creates the perception of a deal while still ensuring a profit. 
* **Alternative Option:** If Bob rejects, we have John as a guaranteed buyer at $120. This safety net allows for a slightly bolder initial offer."
