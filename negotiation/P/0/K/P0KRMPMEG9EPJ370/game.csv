"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. However, $11500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point. I'd be interested in purchasing the product for $10500. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10500 is a bit too low for me at this point.  How about $11000?  I'm still willing to work with you to find a price that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $10750 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try to split the difference.  I'm willing to accept $11250. This would be a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your commitment to finding a fair deal.  I'm willing to come down to $11200.  It's a small step closer to your offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can close this deal.",11200.0,Alice,7,
