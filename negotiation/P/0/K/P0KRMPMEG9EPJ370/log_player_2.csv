Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $10750 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try to split the difference.  I'm willing to accept $11250. This would be a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and your commitment to finding a fair deal.  I'm willing to come down to $11200.  It's a small step closer to your offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can close this deal.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $10,000. 

While Alice has lowered her price to $11,200, it's still above Bob's budget. He only has 3 rounds left. With limited time, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice outweighs the potential of saving an additional $200. 

John's offer guarantees Bob the product within his budget, ensuring a successful transaction."
