Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Bob's Value:** Bob is willing to pay $800,000.
* **John's Value:** John is willing to pay $1,000,000.
* **My Value:** I value the product at $1,000,000 or more.

By offering $900,000, I am:

* **Maximizing my profit:**  This is higher than Bob's value but lower than John's, giving me the best possible deal if Bob accepts.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  If Bob is very interested, he might be willing to negotiate up to $900,000.
* **Protecting my minimum value:** If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John and get my desired value."
