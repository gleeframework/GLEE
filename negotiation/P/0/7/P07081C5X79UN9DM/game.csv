"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I see the value in the product, but that price point is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle on $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're clearly seeing the value in this product, and I respect your negotiation skills. Let's close this gap. How about we land at $1,210,000? This provides a mutually beneficial outcome we can both be happy with.",1210000.0,Alice,5,
