This offer is slightly above Bob's valuation of $1,000,000, but significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring you get a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and even lower than the price I initially offered him.  It's not worth selling at that price.  I will counteroffer."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer. How about $950,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to keep costs down.
