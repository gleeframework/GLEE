"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial price. I'm offering you the product for $1,100,000. This still leaves room for a good deal for you, while also ensuring I get a fair price for my product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer. How about $950,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to keep costs down.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $950,000 is just not enough for me. Let's split the difference. I'm offering you the product for $1,025,000. This is a fair price that allows for both of us to get a good deal.  Let me know your thoughts.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,025,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer. How about $975,000? I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,6,
