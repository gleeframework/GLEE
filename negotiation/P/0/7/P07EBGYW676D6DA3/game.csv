"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you place on the product, I am looking for a more reasonable price. Would you consider selling the product for $500000?",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $500000 is significantly below what the product is truly worth.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $700000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer, while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit. I'm confident this is a fair price, and I hope you'll reconsider.",700000.0,Alice,3,
