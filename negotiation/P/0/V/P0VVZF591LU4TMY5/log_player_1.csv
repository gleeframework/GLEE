Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and I'm pleased to offer it to you first. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $950,000."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you start with a strong position. Offering it slightly below that at $950,000 creates a sense of a deal for Bob. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While you have a strong alternative, you don't want to completely alienate Bob. This offer leaves some space for potential negotiation if he tries to haggle the price down. 
* **Highlighting value:** The message emphasizes the ""unique opportunity"" to pique Bob's interest and justify the high price.

This strategy aims to get you the best possible price from Bob, knowing you have a secure backup plan with John."
