"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice! Thanks for the offer. However, I think the price is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim Low:** Starting with a lower counteroffer ($90) leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a significant discount.
* **Polite and Open:** Maintaining a polite tone keeps the negotiation friendly and indicates my willingness to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $90 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $105. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Alice moved closer to my price, $105 is still more than I'm willing to pay. There's room for further negotiation. 
* **Alternative Exists:**  I have the safety net of buying from John at $100 if I need to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for considering my offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $97? That feels like a fair deal to me."",
""product_price"": 97
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Proposing $97 positions the offer as a compromise, encouraging Alice to see it as a fair solution. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This price is closer to my ideal range while still leaving a small margin for potential negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer you the product for $102. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimal Savings from John:** At this point, Alice is offering the product for $102.  Buying from John would only save me $2.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  Continuing to negotiate aggressively risks Alice walking away, leaving me with John's $100 offer, which is only a slight improvement. 

Sometimes, a small win is better than risking it all for a slightly larger gain."
