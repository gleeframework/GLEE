"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $1,100,000 is above my maximum budget of $1,200,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation:** I know the product is worth less to Alice ($800,000) so there's room to negotiate a lower price. 
* **I want to save money:** Rejecting Alice's initial offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate you countering, Bob, and I understand you're looking for a competitive price.  To be fair to both of us, I could consider coming down to $1,050,000. This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:** $1,050,000 is still above my ideal price point, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable number.
* **Room for further negotiation:** Alice has already lowered her offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. I can likely get a lower price with another counteroffer.
* **Time on my side:**  We still have several rounds left, giving me time to negotiate a better deal before resorting to buying from John."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit above my budget at $1,050,000.  How about we split the difference and meet at $1,000,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
