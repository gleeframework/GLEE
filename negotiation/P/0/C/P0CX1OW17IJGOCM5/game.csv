"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you countering, Bob, and I understand you're looking for a competitive price.  To be fair to both of us, I could consider coming down to $1,050,000. This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit above my budget at $1,050,000.  How about we split the difference and meet at $1,000,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
