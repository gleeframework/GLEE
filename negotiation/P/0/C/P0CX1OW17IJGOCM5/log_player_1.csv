"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay.
* **Close to Bob's Value:**  We know the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. By starting close to that value, we're aiming to capture a significant portion of the potential profit while still leaving some room for negotiation.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message uses a confident tone, emphasizing the product's value and framing the price as fair.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while also being aware of the alternative offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is a significant amount, it's still considerably lower than both our initial asking price and the product's value to him. We have room to negotiate and try to close the gap. Selling to John for $800,000 is our fallback option, but we're not there yet. We'll aim for a counteroffer that keeps the negotiation moving in a positive direction."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you countering, Bob, and I understand you're looking for a competitive price.  To be fair to both of us, I could consider coming down to $1,050,000. This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest."", 
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer splits the difference between our last offer ($1,100,000) and Bob's counteroffer ($950,000). It shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a strong profit.
* **Justification:** The message reiterates the product's value as justification for the higher price. 
* **Positive Tone:** We maintain a positive and collaborative tone to encourage Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit above my budget at $1,050,000.  How about we split the difference and meet at $1,000,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is a strong deal for us. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** We're making a $200,000 profit over our minimum acceptable price.
* **Strong Negotiating Position:** Bob has consistently been moving closer to our price, showing he's serious about the purchase. 
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now means we have the money in hand rather than risking further negotiation or potentially losing the deal altogether. 

While we could push for a slightly higher price, the potential gain is outweighed by the risk of Bob walking away or further negotiation rounds not resulting in a significantly better outcome."
