"Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $18,000.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $10,000 to you, and I'm sure we can work out a price that's fair to both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $18,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're trying to find a good price, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a fair price considering what it's worth to me.  Let's meet halfway here.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $16,000 is still too much for me. I'm willing to go to $14,000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering your value and my budget. Let's work together to find a solution.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $15,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a good value.  Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Alice,5,
