Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $14,000, which is a good starting point since it's significantly above my minimum price of $12,000 but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm mentioning the product's value to Bob to emphasize the potential benefit of the deal for him.
* **Open ended question:** I'm leaving the door open for discussion with an open-ended question, allowing Bob to express his thoughts and potentially make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $11,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't sell the product for less than my floor price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000. That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to the value you see in the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm counteroffering with $13,000, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding firm to my minimum price.
* **Highlighting value again:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value he places on the product, emphasizing the potential benefit of the deal for him.
* **Open ended question:** I'm keeping the conversation open with an open-ended question, inviting further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to find a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? That's a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $12,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to sell for more, this is a fair deal and ensures I don't lose out on a sale. It also saves me from the risk of further negotiation with Bob or selling to John for the same price."
