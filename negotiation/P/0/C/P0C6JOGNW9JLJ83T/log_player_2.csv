"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product at a special introductory price of $9500. This is an exclusive opportunity to acquire a valuable asset worth $10000 at a discounted rate. I believe this offer presents a great value for you and I look forward to hearing your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating.  The product is worth more to Alice than it is to Bob, indicating room for a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore that possibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the discount, but $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a more attractive offer. I am willing to consider $9200 for the product. This is a price that reflects its true value while offering you a reasonable saving. Please let me know if this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is now within Bob's budget and is only slightly more than John's price.  It's a good compromise, and further negotiation might be time-consuming without a significant price reduction.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a reasonable price."
