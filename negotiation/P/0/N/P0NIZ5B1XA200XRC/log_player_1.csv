"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. I would like to counteroffer at $1,100,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still within the first few rounds and can potentially get closer to my desired value of $1,200,000.  I'll counteroffer to see if Bob is willing to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price to reflect the true value of the product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I would like to counteroffer at $1,100,000. I hope this price aligns better with our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer remains at $1,100,000, which is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I've already made concessions and it's becoming clear that Bob isn't willing to meet my price point.  Therefore, selling to John for $1,200,000 is the best option to maximize my profit."
