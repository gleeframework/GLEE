Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product for $115. It's a steal, considering its value! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $90 is too low for me, and I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm also keeping John in mind as a backup buyer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $95 is a more reasonable price. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $95 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price. I'm going to counteroffer again, but I'm also closely watching the rounds and will consider selling to John if the negotiation doesn't improve."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $95 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $100? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
