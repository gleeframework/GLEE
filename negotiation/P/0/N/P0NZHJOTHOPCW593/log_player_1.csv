"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point, as it's a bit higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is interested in paying a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I still think I can get a better price. I'm going to try and counter with something closer to my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 98}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $98. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaves me with a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $92 is getting close to my minimum and we're already four rounds in. It's not worth risking further negotiation at this point, as the time constraint could mean losing out on a better price with John."
