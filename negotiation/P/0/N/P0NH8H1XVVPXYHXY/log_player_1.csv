"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,700,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm also aware of John's offer of $1,500,000, which sets a baseline for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I need to get at least $1,500,000 to meet my minimum. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm dropping my price to $1,600,000, which is still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not desperate. I'm hoping this will get Bob closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to settle for less than what I know I can get from John.  I'll keep negotiating with Bob, but I'm prepared to sell to John if I don't get a better offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm going to try one more time to get closer to my minimum. This counteroffer of $1,550,000 is just below my minimum acceptable price. If Bob still rejects it, I'll sell to John and be done with this negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob is getting closer, I've reached a point where I'm risking losing too much time and potentially a better deal with John.  Since Bob's offer is still below my minimum, I'm going to sell to John and guarantee my desired profit."
