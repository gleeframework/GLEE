Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a common tactic in negotiation to see if he's willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to come down a bit, but I won't go below $150, as that's my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, but I can still get a better deal. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to $155. This is still above Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to compromise.  I'm hoping this will encourage him to meet me halfway. If he rejects, I'm ready to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is only $5 less than my minimum price. At this point, it's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing the deal altogether.  It's better to accept his offer and secure the sale."
