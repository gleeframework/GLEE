"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's close to my desired outcome, but leaves room for negotiation.  This allows me to see if Bob is willing to pay a high price without immediately going for the full $1,500,000.  I want to gauge his interest and potentially find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,300,000 is better than selling to John, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob is showing he's willing to pay more than my minimum, and I can try to push for a higher price. I want to explore if I can get closer to my desired $1,400,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway by offering $1,350,000. This shows good faith and willingness to compromise while still trying to get a price closer to my initial goal.  This should hopefully get us closer to a final agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Although Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not satisfied with $1,280,000. I am still confident I can get closer to $1,350,000. We have five rounds remaining, and it's worth continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1320000} 
```

I'm making a final push to get closer to $1,350,000.  We're getting close to the halfway point of the negotiation, and it's time to see if Bob is willing to make one last compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,290,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,290,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,350,000, we're in the latter half of our negotiation rounds.  Accepting $1,290,000 is still a good deal considering my minimum acceptable price and the risk of failing to reach an agreement with Bob. This price is significantly better than selling to John."
