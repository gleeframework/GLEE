Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're offering, I'm hoping to get it for a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. This is still a good deal for you as it's significantly above your value of $10,000, and it's a fair price for me. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
