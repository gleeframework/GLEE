"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're offering, I'm hoping to get it for a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. This is still a good deal for you as it's significantly above your value of $10,000, and it's a fair price for me. Let's see if we can make this work.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on our previous discussions, I would like to propose a revised price of $12,750 for the product. This still represents a significant profit for us, while offering you a competitive price given your valuation. I hope we can reach an agreement that satisfies both parties.",12750.0,Alice,3,
