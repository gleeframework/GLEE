{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000.  It's a fair price considering the value it brings. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}

This offer aims to maximize profit while still being within the realm of reason for Bob. It leaves room for negotiation, but sets a high starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $17,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you do $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take the $12,000, I'm holding out for a better price. I'll counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $15,500, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested in this price."", ""product_price"": 15500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down.  While that price is getting closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $13,000. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

While $13,000 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still below my minimum price.  I'm going to try to get closer to my ideal price with a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
