"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1100000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your budget constraints. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This price still represents a significant discount from the original offer, but it's a fair reflection of the product's value. What are your thoughts?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I've reviewed your proposal and while it's an improvement, I still feel that we're a bit far apart. I'd like to put forward a counteroffer of $1000000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise considering the value of the product. I hope this suggestion is acceptable.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. However, I still believe the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is my final counteroffer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, we can finalize the deal. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
