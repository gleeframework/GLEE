Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $100. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $125? I think that's a fair price for both of us.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise again, but I think $115 is the lowest I can go. It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

At $115, we're getting close to my absolute limit, and further haggling might irritate Alice.  This price offers a good balance of savings and the chance to get the product."
