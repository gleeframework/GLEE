"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $8500, given my budget and the fact I can get a similar product from John for $8000.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer you the product for $10500. It's still a great deal, considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $9500?  That's a fair compromise, and it's still a good deal for you.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $10000. This is my final offer, as I'm not willing to go any lower. It's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10000 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $9750. This is my final offer. If it doesn't work for you, I'll have to go with John's offer.",9750.0,Bob,6,
