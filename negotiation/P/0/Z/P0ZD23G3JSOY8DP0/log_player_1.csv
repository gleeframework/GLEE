Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $15,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for at least $12,000 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $14,000 gives Bob a potential gain of $1,000 ($15,000 - $14,000) and earns you a profit of $2,000 ($14,000 - $12,000).

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough for him to accept."
