"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $18000. Can you meet me at that price?",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $18000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $19000?  I'm confident this product will be worth more than that to you in the long run.",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $19000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $17500? I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget.",17500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I can't go as low as $17500, I'm willing to come down to $18500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows you to get a great product within your budget. Let's close this deal!",18500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $17000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",17000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $17000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers and go with $17750. This is a fair compromise that lets both of us get a good deal. What do you say?",17750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure if we can meet in the middle again, but I'm willing to pay $17000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Can you consider this offer?",17000.0,Bob,8,
