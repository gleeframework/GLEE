"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the initial price of $1,300,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $950,000 is a significant way off from my valuation of the product.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,150,000. I believe this price reflects the product's true value and potential.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value you place on the product, but I must adhere to my budgetary constraints. I am willing to increase my counteroffer to $1,000,000. This is the maximum amount I can realistically afford at this time.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
