"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $600,000 is significantly lower than what I need to sell it for.  However, I'm willing to work with you.  How about $850,000?  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something below $700,000. Would you be open to $680,000?",680000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $680,000 is still significantly below what I need to sell the product.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $750,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from the product.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",750000.0,Alice,5,
