Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000, which is significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** My message is positive and focuses on the benefits for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm clear that I'm willing to negotiate, which encourages Bob to make a counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects my offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer. If it's within a reasonable range, I might accept. 
* If Bob's counteroffer is too low, I'll make a counteroffer closer to my desired price.
* If the negotiation stalls or if Bob becomes too difficult, I'll go ahead and sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $600,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Accepting it would mean a significant financial loss.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, he has shown interest in the product. There's potential to reach a more favorable price through further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired price, but still leaving room for further negotiation. This will test Bob's willingness to compromise. 
* I'll be prepared to walk away if Bob remains unwilling to meet my minimum acceptable price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $600,000 is significantly lower than what I need to sell it for.  However, I'm willing to work with you.  How about $850,000?  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm counter-offering with $850,000. This is a significant jump from Bob's offer but still below my minimum acceptable price. It shows a willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value he'll gain from the product to justify the price.
* **Open to Agreement:** I'm explicitly stating my desire to reach an agreement, encouraging Bob to come closer to my price.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, make another counteroffer, or walk away to sell to John. 
* I'll remain firm on my minimum acceptable price while trying to find a compromise that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something below $700,000. Would you be open to $680,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $680,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $680,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While it's moved closer to my desired price, $680,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation is not fruitful:** Bob's offers have been stubbornly below my acceptable range, suggesting he may not be willing to meet my needs. 
* **John is a better option:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, providing a safer and more lucrative outcome.

**Next Steps:**

* I will proceed to sell the product to John for $1,200,000.  This ensures I get the best possible deal and minimizes the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $680,000 is still significantly below what I need to sell the product.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $750,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from the product.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm countering with $750,000, which is a significant move towards Bob's offer, but still leaves a margin for profit. It shows a willingness to compromise while protecting my financial interests.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value he'll gain from the product, reinforcing the justification for the price.
* **Focus on Finalization:** I'm using phrases like ""bridge the gap"" and ""finalize this deal"" to encourage Bob to see this as a potential closing point.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll assess the situation carefully. 
* If his counteroffers continue to be significantly below my desired price, I'll move forward with selling to John. 
* If his counteroffers get closer to my price, I'll consider accepting or making another counteroffer."
