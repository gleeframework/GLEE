"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've already gone as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm not willing to pay more than $135. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $120.",135.0,Bob,8,
