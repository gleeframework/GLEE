Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but I believe it's a reasonable starting point to gauge Bob's interest and potentially start a negotiation.  I'm confident in the value of the product and will be prepared to negotiate if Bob counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, I'm still willing to negotiate. I'll counteroffer with a higher price, hoping to reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm countering with $1,300,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing my willingness to negotiate but also maintaining a price that still feels beneficial for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close enough to my desired price point. Accepting his offer means I can secure a sale for $1,250,000, which is significantly better than selling to John for $1,000,000.  I'm confident I can find another buyer if I need to in the future."
