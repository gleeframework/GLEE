"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something really valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $250.",250.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $250 is way above my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $80 at this time.  Let me know if you're willing to consider that.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $250 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $180, which is a significant discount from my original price. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the gesture, but $180 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm sticking with my original offer of $80. It's the absolute maximum I can afford at this time.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $80 is a tough pill to swallow for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $140, which is a significant discount from my original price. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my original offer of $80. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to go with John's offer.",80.0,Bob,6,
