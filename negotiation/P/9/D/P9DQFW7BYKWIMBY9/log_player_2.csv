**Reasoning:**

While Alice is slowly coming down in price, it's unlikely she'll reach a price significantly better than John's offer of $100.  At this point, the potential savings from further negotiation are outweighed by the risk of Alice not budging enough.  Buying from John guarantees the best price with no further hassle."
