"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **The goal is to save money.**  $5,000 is a good price, but there's a chance you can get it for less.
* **We have 10 rounds.** This gives us room to negotiate. 
* **Rejecting the offer gives us more information.** By rejecting, we see if Alice is willing to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:** A significant counteroffer shows our seriousness about negotiating and puts pressure on Alice.
* **Leaving room for compromise:** $4,000 is a substantial drop from $5,000, but still leaves room for Alice to counter without feeling like she's losing too much.
* **Balancing risk and reward:**  We're taking a risk by going lower, but the potential reward of a much lower price is worth it in this early stage."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than her initial offer.**  This suggests she's willing to compromise, but not significantly.
* **We still have time to negotiate.** 7 rounds remain, giving us time to push for a better price.
* **Rejecting allows for another counteroffer.**  We can use this round to gauge Alice's flexibility further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:** This offer is halfway between Alice's last offer ($5,500) and our previous offer ($4,000). It shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a lower price.
* **Testing the waters:**  This counteroffer will help us understand how much Alice is willing to move on price.
* **Maintaining pressure:**  By continuing to counter, we're showing Alice that we're serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is raising her offer again.** This pattern suggests she's not very willing to budge.
* **We still have time.** We've only had 5 rounds, giving us a decent amount of time to get a better price.
* **The alternative is still costly.** Buying from John for $10,000 is a significant jump from Alice's current offer.  We should try to negotiate further before resorting to that option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  This offer is halfway between Alice's latest offer ($6,000) and our previous offer ($4,500). It demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a lower price.
* **Time is running out:** We're halfway through the rounds, so we need to start closing the gap to avoid having to buy from John.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer will help us understand how close we are to a deal. If Alice accepts, we've secured a good price. If she rejects, we have more information to make a final decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice keeps raising the price.** This indicates she's not willing to lower the price significantly.  However, we're still better off rejecting and trying to negotiate than buying from John.
* **Only 3 rounds left.** We need to make a decision soon to avoid buying from John.
* **We've reached a point where further negotiation is necessary.**  Our counteroffer in the next round should be strategically chosen based on our assessment of Alice's behavior."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Last chance:** With only 2 rounds remaining, we need to make a final push to get a deal.
* **Balancing risk and reward:**  $5,500 is a good price, but we are still saving $4,500 compared to John's offer.
* **Testing the waters:** If Alice accepts, we have a deal. If she rejects, we can decide between buying from her at her next offer or buying from John in the last round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** It's clear that Alice is not willing to negotiate further.
* **Only one round left.** We are running out of time to make a deal.
* **John's offer is a better deal.** Although it is not ideal, buying from John for $10,000 is still a better option than accepting Alice's current offer. 

Given that Alice has continuously raised the price and we've only one round left, it's better to secure the product from John rather than risk further negotiation and potentially be left with no product."
