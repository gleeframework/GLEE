"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $137.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to meet me at $130?",130.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $130 is closer to where I need to be. Let's try $135 - I'm sure we can come to an agreement.",135.0,Alice,5,
