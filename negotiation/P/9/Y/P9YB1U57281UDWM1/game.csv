"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $22,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to part with. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $18,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $15,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise here.",15000.0,Bob,4,
