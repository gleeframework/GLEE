"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $9,000? I think that's a fair price.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $10,500? That's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,750?  That's a significant step up from my last offer, and shows I'm serious about buying.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $9,750 is still too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but $10,250 is the lowest I can go. This price reflects the value of the product. Let's close this deal.",10250.0,Alice,5,
