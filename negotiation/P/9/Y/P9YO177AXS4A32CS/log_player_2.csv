Round 2

""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $9,000? I think that's a fair price."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $10,500? That's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $9,750 is still too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but $10,250 is the lowest I can go. This price reflects the value of the product. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to a price I'm willing to pay, it's unlikely she'll go much lower than her current offer of $10,250.  Since I can buy the product from John for $10,000 guaranteed, it's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation with Alice. I might save a small amount, but I could also end up empty-handed if the deal falls through."
