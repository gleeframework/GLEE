"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's best to reject and try to negotiate a lower price.  You have 10 rounds to work with, so there's time to see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. I'm thinking of a price more in the range of $1100000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your budget, although it's better than her initial offer.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating and hopefully get closer to your desired price point. You still have a few rounds left to bargain, and you have the option to buy from John if you can't reach an agreement with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,100,000 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which I believe is a fair price given our ongoing discussion. Let's try to find some middle ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $950000 is still a bit below my target, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price more in the range of $1050000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the product's value and our ongoing discussion. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to your budget, but you can likely still do better.  You're only a few rounds away from buying from John, and there's a chance that Alice will come down further to secure the deal.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and allows you to see if you can get closer to your desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is my absolute maximum. This is a fair price considering our ongoing discussion and the fact that I have other options.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1000000 is your maximum, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price more in the range of $1025000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is still slightly higher than your maximum. While it's tempting to try another counteroffer, you're already at round 7.  This means you have limited rounds left to negotiate.  Buying from John at $1,000,000 guarantees you get the product within your budget and avoids the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer and leaving you with no deal."
