"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
 ""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):** By starting with a significantly higher price than my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value, I aim to anchor the negotiation in my favor. This sets a high reference point for subsequent offers and counteroffers. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The initial high price provides me with ample room to negotiate downward while still aiming for a final price above my minimum. 
* **Confident Tone:** Expressing confidence in the product's value and the fairness of the price helps influence Bob's perception."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I'm confident that this price reflects its worth and aligns with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is a significant amount and closer to my target, I still have room to negotiate. Accepting immediately might make me leave money on the table.  I'll counter with a price closer to his offer but still above my absolute minimum."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the value this product brings is truly unique. I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. I believe this price point reflects the value while acknowledging your initial offer."", 
 ""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant concession from my initial price ($150,000) to demonstrate flexibility and encourage Bob to do the same. 
* **Staying Above Target:** This counteroffer keeps me comfortably above my $1,200,000 minimum and closer to Bob's offer, aiming to find a middle ground.
* **Justification:**  Reiterating the product's value helps justify the higher price point and keeps the negotiation focused on the product's worth rather than just numbers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,650,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to propose a price of $1,450,000, which I think is a more balanced price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is negotiating strategically and coming closer to my minimum, but I believe there's still some room to maneuver. While $1,450,000 is tempting, I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can secure a slightly higher price. I'll aim for a counteroffer that splits the difference to entice him while staying above my absolute bottom line."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle on $1,550,000? This demonstrates my willingness to meet you halfway while ensuring a fair deal for both of us."", 
 ""product_price"": 1550000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer splits the difference between his last offer ($1,450,000) and my previous counteroffer ($1,650,000). This signals a strong desire to reach an agreement.
* **Clear Justification:**  By framing it as ""meeting halfway,"" I emphasize fairness and encourage Bob to accept the compromise.
* **Above Minimum:**  Importantly, this price still keeps me comfortably above my $1,200,000 minimum, allowing for a profitable sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to propose a price of $1,400,000, which I think is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** While not ideal, Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is still significantly above my absolute minimum of $1,200,000, securing a healthy profit.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly higher price, but the risk of Bob walking away or stalling increases with each round. 
* **Time Value:**  Accepting now guarantees the sale and allows me to move on to other potential deals or investments. Holding out for a slightly higher price might not be worth the additional time and effort. 
* **Bob's Firmness:** Bob's language suggests he's getting close to his limit. Pushing further might jeopardize the deal altogether."
