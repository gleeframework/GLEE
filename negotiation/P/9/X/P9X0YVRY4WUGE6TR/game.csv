"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is worth much more to you than that.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $700,000. I'll offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $825,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you consider $750,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $750,000 is still a bit above your target price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as that. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll offer it to you for $800,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,5,
