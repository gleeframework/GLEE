Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $800,000.  
* **Potential Profit:** There's a potential $200,000 profit margin if you can sell to Bob for more than your minimum.

**Strategy**

The key is to propose a price that's appealing to Bob while still maximizing your profit. Here's a balanced approach:

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $900,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth in the market."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Why This Offer Works**

* **Attractive to Bob:** The price is significantly less than Bob's perceived value of $800,000.
* **Profitable for You:** You secure a $100,000 profit above your guaranteed sale to John. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** While this is a strong opening, there's some wiggle room if Bob attempts to negotiate further.

**Important Note:**  This assumes you have no information about Bob's financial situation or desperation to acquire the product. If you had more insights into Bob's motivations, you could potentially aim for a higher price."
