"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  I think it would be incredibly valuable to you.  I'm asking for $14,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $14,000 is too high, and he can potentially get a better price by counter-offering. He has 10 rounds, so there's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $14,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,500.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower counteroffer that is still above Alice's value of $12,000.  This allows for some room to negotiate while still keeping the price below his maximum of $15,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a bit more than that.  Would you consider $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is still higher than Bob's ideal price. While it's closer to his maximum, there's still room for negotiation, and Bob doesn't want to settle too quickly. He can continue counter-offering to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $13,000.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is again counter-offering, but this time he's raising his offer slightly to show willingness to compromise.  $13,000 is a good middle ground between his previous offer and Alice's current offer. This shows a genuine attempt to reach a deal, but still remains within Bob's budget."
