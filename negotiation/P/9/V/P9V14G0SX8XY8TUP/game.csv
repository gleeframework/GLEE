"While I appreciate your offer, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is a fair price, as I'm sure you'll agree, given the value I'm placing on it.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 was a bit steep, but I was hoping you could meet me in the middle. I'm willing to compromise and sell the product to you for $11,000. It's a fair price, considering the value it holds for you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to go up to $9,000.  This would be a great deal for both of us, allowing you to make a good profit while still being within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $9,000, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for you and the fact that you're already willing to pay more than the minimum you mentioned earlier.",10500.0,Alice,5,
