"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you'll get it for a price below its value to you, and I'll still get a good return on my investment. Let me know your thoughts!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you do $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, how about $1,350,000?  That still leaves you with a good margin of profit. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
