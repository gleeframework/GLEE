Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with my minimum price, as I'm not willing to sell below $120. While Bob's willing to pay up to $100, I'm hoping to see if I can negotiate a higher price, especially since John is already willing to buy at $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, I'm still not willing to sell below $120. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum.  $115 is a good compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will agree."
