"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand that my initial price was a bit high, but $80 is too low for me. Could you meet me somewhere in the middle, say around $150?",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $150 is closer, I'm aiming for something below $100. Would you consider $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $95 is still quite a bit below what I'm hoping for.  How about we split the difference and call it $122? This gets us closer to a fair deal.",122.0,Alice,5,
