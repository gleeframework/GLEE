"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $18,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's way above his budget, and he can likely get a better price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $12,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, he can still try to get a better price. It's worth seeing if he can negotiate further before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $15,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000.  It's a fair price considering the product's value to me, and it's a good deal for you as well. Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $13,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $14,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it's a good price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While it's still above his initial target, it's a good compromise and he's getting a better price than what John is offering. Further negotiation could continue, but there's a risk of losing the deal to John or having the negotiation drag on."
