"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe you'd find incredibly valuable. I'm offering it to you for $11500. It's a great deal, as it's worth more than that to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  $11,500 is less than $12,000.
* **It's within your budget:**  The offer is below your maximum price point of $12,000. 

Even though you could potentially negotiate with Alice, accepting her offer guarantees you get the product at a price that's both within your budget and better than John's."
