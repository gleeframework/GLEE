"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,500 is a good offer, it's a bit lower than my desired price point. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop my price to $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  $9,000 is still a bit high for me, though.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,750?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to find a compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $8,900.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while being within your budget.  What do you say?",8900.0,Alice,5,
