"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? I'm confident this is still a good deal for you, as the product is worth $8,000 to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",7500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not quite there yet.  $7,200 is a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference - how about $7,350?  That's a fair compromise, and still a good value for you considering the product's worth.",7350.0,Alice,5,
