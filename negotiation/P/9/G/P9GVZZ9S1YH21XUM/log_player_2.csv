"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this truly valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $1,400,000. I believe this reflects its worth while leaving you with a significant return on your investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than Alice's valuation of $1,000,000. There's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Given your valuation and my budget, I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is a significant deviation from my initial asking price. This product offers immense value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save money. While $1,300,000 is closer to his ideal price, it's still higher than his desired target. There's still room for further negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer again and potentially find a price closer to his target."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $1,200,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need you to meet me closer to my valuation. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,275,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on your position, but $1,275,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.
