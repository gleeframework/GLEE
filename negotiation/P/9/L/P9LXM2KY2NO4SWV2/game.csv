"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $15000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $15000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise a bit though. How about we meet in the middle at $17500?  This still leaves me room to make a profit, and I believe it's a fair price for the value this product offers.",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate the adjustment. However, I'm still not able to commit to $17500. I think we could aim for $16000 which would be a fair compromise for both of us.",16000.0,Bob,4,
