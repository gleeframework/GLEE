"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product,  $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let me know if that works for you.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it'll allow us to move forward with the sale.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your position, but $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $8,750. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on. What do you think?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand we're getting closer, but $8,750 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,900. This price reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your budget. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this deal. What do you think?",8900.0,Alice,5,
