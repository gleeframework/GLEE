Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it would be very valuable for you.  I'm willing to part with it for $95."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, your goal is to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $95 leaves some wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate a bit, while still ensuring you make a profit above your minimum.
* **Appeal to Bob's Interest:**  By highlighting the product's value to Bob, you might increase his perceived value and willingness to pay a bit more."
