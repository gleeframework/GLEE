"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 11000} 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit lower than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a good starting point to see if Bob is serious about buying and what his price range might be."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum. I'm not desperate to sell, so I'll reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. I have a backup buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price, giving me some leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm meeting Bob halfway by dropping the price to $10,500. This shows him I'm willing to compromise, but still maintains a profit for me. It's a good balance between pushing for a higher price and not risking losing the deal altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and I'm not willing to accept it. I'll keep negotiating, but I'm also considering the option of selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

I'm sticking to my minimum profit margin by offering the product for $10,000. This shows Bob I'm serious about getting a fair price and that I'm not willing to go lower.  It's a good strategy to show I'm not desperate and willing to walk away if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where I'm not confident Bob will come up to my minimum.  It's getting late in the negotiation, and while I'd like to get the most I can, it's not worth risking missing out on a guaranteed $12,000 from John. I'll take the sure thing."
