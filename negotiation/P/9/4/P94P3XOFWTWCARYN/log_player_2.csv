"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll be very happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a good deal, it's still above my maximum budget of $10,000. I want to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in your product, but I'm only able to go up to $8,500 at this time.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, knowing that Alice likely won't accept it immediately.  I'm offering a price that's still above her minimum value ($8,000), but significantly lower than her initial offer. This will hopefully start the negotiation process and encourage Alice to come down on her price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not able to go that low.  How about $9,000? That's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,000 is still higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm going to try to negotiate further to see if I can get a price closer to my target of $8,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to consider $8,750?  This would be a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a slightly higher price than my previous counteroffer, but still significantly lower than Alice's current offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and meet her halfway, hopefully encouraging her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's go with $8,900. This is my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and this price is within my budget.  While I'd prefer to pay closer to $8,500, it's likely that we've reached a reasonable compromise.  Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a good price and avoids the risk of losing it to another buyer or having to pay the higher price from John."
