Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me, and I think it would be a great fit for you too. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Tone:** A friendly message helps build rapport and makes Bob more likely to consider the offer.
* **Focus on Value:**  Mentioning the product's value to him emphasizes its potential benefit for Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** This price is high enough to allow for negotiation without immediately needing to consider John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and even below my initial offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate with Bob and potentially get closer to my desired price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While selling to John guarantees my minimum price, there's a chance I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While $9,000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer with Reasoning:**  I'm providing a reason for my counter-offer, showing that I'm not just arbitrarily sticking to my original price.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This price is exactly in the middle between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This signals a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasize Fairness:**  I'm framing the offer as ""fair for both of us"" to appeal to Bob's sense of equity."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9,500? It's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing in on Minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,500 is still quite a bit below my minimum of $15,000. 
* **Limited Upside:** Further negotiation with Bob seems unlikely to get me significantly closer to my desired price.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and ensures I don't lose out on a profitable deal.  

While I'd prefer to sell at a higher price, the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob isn't worth the potential gain. It's more secure to take the guaranteed profit from John."
