"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's something I've carefully developed and it's worth at least $1,200,000 to you, I'm sure.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000.  This is a significant discount, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
