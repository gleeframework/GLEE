"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $14,000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a little high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's offer to leave room for negotiation and gauge her flexibility. 
* **Polite and Reasonable:** While the offer is low, I want to maintain a positive tone and express interest in finding a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I have to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $12,500. Is that something you'd be comfortable with? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Alice met us halfway, the price is still above her value. There's potential for her to go lower, especially as we're still in the early rounds.
* **Alternative Option:** We have the safety net of John's offer, so we're not desperate to accept a price we're not happy with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we settle at $11,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  I'm suggesting a price that's roughly halfway between our last two offers, aiming for a compromise.
* **Conveying Fairness:** I want Alice to see this as a reasonable counteroffer, not just me trying to lowball her. 
* **Time Constraint:** As we progress through rounds, getting closer to John's offer becomes a factor."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $12,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Bottom Line:**  Alice has explicitly stated that $12,000 is her lowest price. This suggests further negotiation is unlikely to be successful.
* **Meeting Her Value:** This price aligns with what we know to be the product's worth to Alice. It's a fair deal.
* **Avoiding John's Offer:** While we have John's offer as a fallback, accepting Alice's offer saves us $3,000 and avoids the risk of failing to reach a deal with Alice in later rounds."
