"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid I can't meet you at $100. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $135? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",135.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price at $125. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. How about we meet at $140? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for this high-quality product.",140.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to walking away, but I still think I can get a better deal. I'm willing to meet you at $130, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider buying from John for $120",130.0,Bob,6,
