,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $14,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm eager to make a deal, the value of this product to the right buyer is significant. I could come down to $13,000, which I feel is a fair compromise. This offer reflects the true worth of what I'm providing.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has significant value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think that's as high as I can go.",11500.0,Bob,4,
