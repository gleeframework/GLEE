Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $14,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm eager to make a deal, the value of this product to the right buyer is significant. I could come down to $13,000, which I feel is a fair compromise. This offer reflects the true worth of what I'm providing."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has significant value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While I could push for more, accepting $11,500 is a solid win. It's significantly more than my minimum and a good return.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob altogether."
