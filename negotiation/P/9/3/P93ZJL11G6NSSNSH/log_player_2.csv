# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a unique opportunity with significant value. My asking price is $1200000.  This price reflects the product's exceptional worth and potential for growth. I'm open to discussing your perspective and finding a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I understand your budget constraints, $850000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1000000, which is a significant concession from my initial offer. This price is still below the product's worth to me but allows for a reasonable margin for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Alice's offer is still above your budget, and you're not sure if further negotiation will get you to a price you're comfortable with.  It's safer to go with John's offer and secure the product for your maximum budget."
