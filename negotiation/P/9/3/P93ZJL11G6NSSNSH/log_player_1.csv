Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the potential of the product, $1200000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is a significant concession from my initial offer. This price is still below the product's worth to me but allows for a reasonable margin for you.
