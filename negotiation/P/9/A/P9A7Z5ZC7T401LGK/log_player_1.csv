Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price point, especially considering its worth to you."", ""product_price"": 14000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize your potential profit. Bob is willing to pay $15,000, so starting near that point makes sense.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While you don't want to go below $10,000, a slightly lower initial offer leaves room for Bob to counter-offer and potentially still land you a higher price.
* **Highlight Value:**  Emphasize why this is a good deal for Bob, reminding him of its value to him specifically. 
 
This strategy balances getting the best price from Bob with the security of having John as a backup buyer."
