Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a price of $1,150,000. I believe it holds significant value, and this offer represents a unique opportunity to acquire it."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we could offer the product at $1,200,000 (knowing John will buy it), aiming slightly lower increases the chance of Bob accepting and getting us a profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 is a strong offer that still leaves room for negotiation but ensures a substantial profit above Bob's perceived value. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** The knowledge of John's guaranteed purchase at $1,200,000 gives us a strong fallback position and leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
