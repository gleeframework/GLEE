Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its unique value, I'm offering it at $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential."", ""product_price"": 2300000}
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This allows room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he gets you to come down.
* **Anchoring:** By throwing out a high initial price, you anchor Bob's perception of the product's value.  Even if it's far from his valuation, it sets a high starting point for the negotiation.
* **John as Leverage:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 (from John) gives you a strong position. You can be more willing to walk away from a bad deal with Bob.

This first offer is designed to gauge Bob's reaction and provide a starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product, considering its worth to me is capped at $800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is a significant amount, it's still below our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. We know John is willing to pay the full amount, so there's no need to settle for less. We'll reject Bob's offer and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is generous, the value of this product to the right buyer is considerable. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,950,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Decrease:** We dropped our price by $350,000, showing Bob we are flexible and willing to negotiate. 
* **Still Above Minimum:**  The new offer is still significantly above both our minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's valuation ($800,000), leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Justification:** We provided a vague justification (""value to the right buyer"") to avoid fully revealing our bottom line.
* **Compromise Language:**  Using phrases like ""meet in the middle"" fosters a sense of collaboration and encourages Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,700,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering my budget and the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,700,000 is now above our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While we could potentially push for a slightly higher price, the gains are getting smaller and there's a risk of Bob walking away.  
* **Time Value of Money:**  Securing a deal now is generally preferable to prolonging negotiations for a potentially small increase.

Accepting the $1,700,000 offer represents a significant profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether."
