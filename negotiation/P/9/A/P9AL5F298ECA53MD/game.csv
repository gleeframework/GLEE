"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'd be willing to pay $1200000 for it. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $1350000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and rarity.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1350000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1250000.  This is a fair price considering our discussions, and it would be a good deal for both of us.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1300000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll sell the product to you for $1290000. This is the absolute lowest price I can accept, considering the product's value and rarity.",1290000.0,Alice,5,
