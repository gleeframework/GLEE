{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it's also a great value for you.  My initial offer is $1,400,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, considering its value to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial valuation, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm not willing to settle for a loss at this point. 

I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more favorable price. If not, I have the option to sell to John for my target price."

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.
