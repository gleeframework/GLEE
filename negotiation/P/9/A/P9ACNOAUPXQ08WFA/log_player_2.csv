(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
 Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's much better to negotiate and see if she's willing to come down significantly.  I'll aim to get it much closer to that $8,000 mark."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, that price is way too high for me. I'm interested, but it needs to be a lot lower to make sense for me.  How about we start at $6,000?"", ""product_price"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000, but I'm not going any lower than that.

Alice is coming down, but $9,000 is still too high. I need to push for a better deal and see if I can get closer to my $8,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $7,000.  That's a fair offer considering it's a significant discount from your initial asking price."", ""product_price"": 7000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000, but I'm willing to make a compromise. I'll meet you at $8,200, which is still a good deal for both of us.

This is getting close, but I know I can get it for $8,000 from John. One more counteroffer should do the trick!"

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  To be honest, I've got another offer at $8,000. If you can match that, I'll buy it from you right now.  It's a fair price and saves us both any more back and forth."", ""product_price"": 8000}"
