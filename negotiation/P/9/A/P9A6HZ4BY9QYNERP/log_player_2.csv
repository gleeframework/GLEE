Given its value and potential impact on your operations, I propose a price of $12,000 for it. This price reflects not only the cost of production but also the strategic advantage this product could provide to you. I look forward to hearing your response.

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  $12,000 is less than $15,000.
* **You still get a good deal:** While you could potentially try to negotiate further with Alice, accepting her offer still saves you $3,000 compared to buying from John."
