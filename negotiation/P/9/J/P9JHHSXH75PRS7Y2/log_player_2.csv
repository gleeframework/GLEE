"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which we believe would greatly benefit your business. Given its high value and quality, I propose a price of $15,000 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $15,000 is above his maximum budget.  He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's quality, $15,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I am willing to consider your offer, but I need to adjust the price slightly to $14,000. This still reflects the product's value, while accommodating your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $14,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his comfort zone.  He should try to negotiate further, aiming to get the price down closer to his initial counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still a bit steep.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm happy to pay $12,500 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's within my budget."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your proposal. I appreciate your effort to find a mutually beneficial solution. Considering the value of the product and your budget, I am willing to accept an offer of $13,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects its value while staying within your financial limits. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. This is the best deal he's likely to get from Alice, and it's still within his budget. While he could potentially negotiate further, it's likely that Alice will hold firm at this price. Buying from John would cost him more, so accepting Alice's offer is the most financially advantageous decision at this point."
