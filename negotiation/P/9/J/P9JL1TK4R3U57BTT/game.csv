"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering your value and my budget. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable deal.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $13,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm counteroffering at $16,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $16,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. I'm confident this price reflects the value of the product for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still not quite comfortable with $14,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and counteroffer at $15,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",15500.0,Alice,5,
