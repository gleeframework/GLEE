"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe will be a great asset to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. This is a fantastic price considering its value and potential. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to value:** I'm highlighting the product's value and potential benefits for Bob to make the offer more enticing.
* **Open-ended question:** I'm ending with a question to encourage Bob to respond and start the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $6,000 is far below my minimum value of $15,000 and significantly less than my initial offer.
* **Room for negotiation:**  There's still room for negotiation.  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it shows he's interested in the product.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I can likely get a higher price by counter-offering.

I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is far below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a great deal for you.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm lowering my price from $12,000 to $9,000, showing flexibility and willingness to compromise. 
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's value again to justify my counteroffer.
* **Positive and encouraging:**  I'm using positive language like ""great deal"" and ""finalize this deal"" to create a sense of optimism and encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I can tell this product is valuable.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $7,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is moving closer:** Bob is showing a willingness to compromise and is getting closer to my desired price. 
* **Time to push for more:** I believe there's still room for me to get a better deal.  I'll counteroffer again and see if we can reach an agreement closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  $7,500 is still a bit too low for me, considering the product's value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $8,500.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price again, but I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasizing fairness:** I'm highlighting that this price is ""fair"" to both of us, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Urgency and encouragement:** I'm adding a sense of urgency by saying ""Let's make this happen"" to encourage Bob to accept."
