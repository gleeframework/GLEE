"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand your enthusiasm for it, but I believe I can find a fair price somewhere else. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $9500 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not quite ready to accept $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $11000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the value I know the product holds. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still feel that $11000 is slightly above my budget for this purchase. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10500. I hope this offers a compromise that suits both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're able to continue the negotiation. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10500. I think the product's value is worth more than that. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $11500. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price. Let me know if you're interested.",11500.0,Alice,5,
