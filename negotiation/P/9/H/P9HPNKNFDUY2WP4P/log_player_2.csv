"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's initial offer is far above Bob's budget.  It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Aggressive but Realistic:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating Bob's seriousness about negotiation.  
* **Room for Compromise:** It still leaves room for Alice to counter without going below Bob's maximum price of $800,000.
* **Strategic First Move:**  This sets the tone for the negotiation and pushes Alice to consider a more reasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Budget:** Alice's offer is only $50,000 above Bob's maximum price, and it's possible that she's unwilling to go lower.
* **Risk of Escalation:** Rejecting could lead to further rounds of counteroffers, wasting time and potentially resulting in a higher price.
* **Opportunity Cost:** There's a chance that John might raise his price or become unavailable in later rounds, making Alice's offer more attractive. 

Overall, accepting Alice's offer is the most pragmatic choice, as it secures the product at a price close to Bob's limit and minimizes risk."
