"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's close this deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm still not quite there at $9,800.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,150?  That would be a fair compromise for both of us.",10150.0,Alice,5,
