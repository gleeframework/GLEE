"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this fantastic product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $9,000? I think that's a fair price.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $10,800. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $10,800 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $9,900?  That seems like a fair compromise.",9900.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,900 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $10,400. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",10400.0,Alice,5,
