"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this fantastic product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's start the negotiation. Alice's first offer is quite high. We have plenty of room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $9,000? I think that's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $10,800. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still not at a point where it makes sense to jump at her offer. We're getting closer to my limit, but I can still try to negotiate a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $10,800 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $9,900?  That seems like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 9900
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,900 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $10,400. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $10,400. While I could try to haggle further, it's not worth the risk of her digging in her heels.  Buying from John for $10,000 ensures I get the product at the best possible price for me."
