"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $1,000,000 for the product.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $800,000. Considering your willingness to negotiate, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $900,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm offering $850,000 for the product, and I believe this is a fair compromise given our previous discussions.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go below $950,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to feel confident that the price is fair for both of us. I'm proposing a new price of $925,000 for the product. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's worth considering.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This shows my serious interest in acquiring the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $950,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to feel confident that the price is fair for both of us. I'm proposing a new price of $912,500 for the product.
