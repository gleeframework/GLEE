"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at this price?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $7,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $8,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $8,250? This is the highest I'm willing to go.",8250.0,Bob,4,
