"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob can definitely do better than $12,000.  Since the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering a price slightly above Alice's perceived value of the product ($10,000). This gives Alice some incentive to accept while still allowing Bob to save a significant amount of money compared to Alice's initial offer or buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is slightly lower than her first, it's still not as good as Bob can get.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to bring the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is again offering a price slightly above Alice's perceived value, trying to strike a balance between a fair price and a good deal for himself. He's demonstrating a willingness to compromise, hoping to secure a deal that's better than the $12,500 offer, but still leaves some room for Alice to make a profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is creeping closer to Bob's maximum price of $15,000.  While continuing to negotiate might get a slightly lower price, it risks Alice walking away or pushing the price even higher. It's now more efficient and less risky for Bob to simply buy from John. He's guaranteed a product within his budget and avoids further potential negotiation rounds."
