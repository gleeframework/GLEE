Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value, and this offer reflects a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he wants to negotiate, but still ensures Alice a significant profit. 
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing John will buy the product for $10,000 gives Alice a strong fallback position. She doesn't need to go below that price."
