Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $825,000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I can include a one-year warranty and a comprehensive support package, which will add significant value to the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $820,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and the added warranty and support sweeten the deal. Accepting at $820,000 secures a significant saving compared to John's offer."
