Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point because it's a reasonable price for a product worth $8,000, and it gives me some room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While I would prefer to get a higher price, Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept.  It's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing out on the sale."
