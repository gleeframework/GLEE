"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $90 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. I know I can get the product for $80 from John, so I'll try to negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the counteroffer, but $65 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $72.50? That's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $72.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $72.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is coming down, $72.50 is still more than I need to spend. I'll try to negotiate a bit closer to $70."
