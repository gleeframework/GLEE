Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $90 for it."", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know it's worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate if he counteroffers. However, it's important to note that I have the option to sell to John for $80 at any time, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob doesn't accept a reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering!  That's a little steep for me, would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $65 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price through further negotiation, and if not, I can always sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate the counteroffer, but $65 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $72.50? That's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 72.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  How about $70 even? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $70 is a good price, and it's closer to my desired price than John's offer.  I'm confident that I can make a profit on this sale, and it's not worth risking further negotiation for a few extra dollars."
