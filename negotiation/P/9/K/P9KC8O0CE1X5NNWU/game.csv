"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the gesture, but I believe we can come to an even better agreement. How about we aim for $900,000 for the product? I think this price reflects both the value of the product to me and your willingness to negotiate.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This price still gives you a good deal and allows me to recover a significant portion of the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand your position, but I'm hoping for a bit more flexibility. How about we aim for $950,000? This would be a fair compromise, reflecting both the value of the product to me and your original asking price.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to negotiate.  However, I'm not comfortable going below $975,000 at this point.  This price is still a significant savings for you compared to my original asking price, and it allows me to recover a substantial portion of the value of the product. Let's see if we can make this work.",975000.0,Alice,5,
