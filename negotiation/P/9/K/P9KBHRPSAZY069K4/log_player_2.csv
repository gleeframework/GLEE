Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise between your previous offer and Alice's latest offer. It shows you're willing to meet her halfway, but still want to save some money. If Alice rejects, you can  consider lowering your offer slightly more in the next round, but you'll be getting closer to your maximum price."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,120,000, which is only $20,000 more than your last counteroffer.  While you could continue to negotiate, there's a good chance you won't get a better price. It's likely that Alice won't go much lower, and you're risking losing the deal altogether. Accepting this offer saves you $380,000 compared to buying from John."
