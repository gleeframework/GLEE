Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this to be a fair deal considering its significant worth.  Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Knowing Bob values the product at $800,000 and you have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, aiming for a price above Bob's valuation but below your guaranteed sale maximizes potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $950,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle while still exceeding your guaranteed sale price.
* **Confident Presentation:** The message emphasizes the product's value without revealing your bottom line, encouraging Bob to seriously consider the offer."
