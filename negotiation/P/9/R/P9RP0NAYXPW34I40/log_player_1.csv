I'm offering Bob the product for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the product is worth $12,000 to him, and I need to make a profit of at least $1,000. I'm leaving room for negotiation, but I'm also prepared to sell to John if Bob doesn't accept a price that's reasonable for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $11,000 is still a good deal for me.  It's above my minimum threshold of $10,000 and allows me to make a profit.  There's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer in future rounds, and I don't want to risk losing this sale altogether."
