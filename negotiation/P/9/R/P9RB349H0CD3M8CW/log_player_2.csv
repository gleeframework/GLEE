"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, but I have to be honest with you, it's a one-of-a-kind item. I'm looking for $180 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

Alice's offer of $180 is significantly higher than your $120 limit and what John offers. Buying from John is the most financially sensible option in this scenario."
