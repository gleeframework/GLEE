"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to begin negotiations."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  By starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) and even a bit above my own minimum ($1,500,000), I leave room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:**  The message frames the high price as justified due to the ""value and potential"" of the product.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The wording clearly indicates that this is an opening offer and I'm willing to negotiate.

This strategy aims to:

* **Anchor:** Establish a high reference point in Bob's mind.
* **Gather Information:**  His response (acceptance, rejection, counteroffer) will reveal information about his willingness to pay.
* **Maintain Flexibility:**  I retain the option to adjust my approach significantly in subsequent rounds based on Bob's reactions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering me the opportunity to purchase this product, Alice. After considering its value and my budget, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations while staying within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer matches my absolute minimum acceptable price. While I started high hoping for more, there's no guarantee further negotiation will yield a better result. It's possible Bob won't budge much higher, and I risk him walking away entirely. Accepting now secures a profitable deal."
