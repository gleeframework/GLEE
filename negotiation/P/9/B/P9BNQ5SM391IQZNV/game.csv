"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13000, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $11000. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm really interested in making a deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
