I'm starting with a high offer to see if Bob is willing to bite. If he isn't, I can always adjust my offer downward in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the price is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for that price yet. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's work together to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:

While $775,000 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still not convinced it's the best deal I can get. I'll try to negotiate a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $775,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal now."", ""product_price"": 825000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $795,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $795,000 is close to my minimum price, I still want to see if I can get a little bit more from Bob. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

{""message"": ""Bob, we're very close now! I'm willing to come down to $810,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, and I don't want to miss out on this opportunity. Let's agree on this price and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 810000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really close to accepting, but I still think $810,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $795,000 again. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a stalemate. While $795,000 is a good offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm also running out of time. It's better to sell to John for $800,000 and guarantee a sale at my minimum price."
