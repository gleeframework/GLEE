Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with my minimum price, hoping Bob is willing to meet it. If not, I'll have to consider John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $110 is less than my ideal, it's still a better deal than selling to John for $120. It's a good compromise and allows me to avoid the risk of further negotiation."
