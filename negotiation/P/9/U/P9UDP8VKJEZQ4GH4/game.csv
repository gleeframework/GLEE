"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This reflects the value you've stated, but also allows me to earn a fair profit.  Let's try to find common ground.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. While $1,125,000 is closer, it's still not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $1,140,000. This represents a significant compromise from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value we've both agreed upon. Let's make this deal happen!",1140000.0,Alice,5,
