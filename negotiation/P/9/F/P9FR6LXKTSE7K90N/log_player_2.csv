"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is a good deal, but Bob can potentially do better.  Since the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, he has room to negotiate and try to get a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I think the product is worth more than $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,500 is better than her previous offer, Bob still has room to negotiate. Since the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, he can likely secure a better price if he continues to negotiate. Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to counter-offer and potentially reach a price closer to his desired $10,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still think the product is worth more than $11,000. I'm willing to give you a small discount, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is still hoping to get the product for $10,000 or $11,000, Alice has made it clear that she's unwilling to go lower than $11,250. At this point, continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal and having to buy the product from John for $15,000.  Accepting Alice's offer of $11,250 is the best option as it's still a significant savings compared to buying from John and represents a good compromise in the negotiation."
