"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $9,500, which is a bit above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and friendly tone to create a good atmosphere for negotiation. 
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to consider the offer.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to secure a price as close to my minimum of $10,000 as possible. By starting high, I can potentially get a better price, but I'm also prepared to negotiate down if necessary.  If Bob rejects the offer, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer and the remaining rounds. I'll also keep the option of selling to John in mind if the negotiation with Bob doesn't lead to a satisfactory outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $8,500 is significantly below my minimum of $10,000. 
* **Negotiation is Still Possible:** I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but his initial counteroffer is too low to accept.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting his offer maintains my leverage and signals that I'm not desperate for a quick deal. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired minimum. I'll continue to monitor the situation and be ready to sell to John if the negotiation with Bob doesn't yield a satisfactory result."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but  $9,000 is the absolute minimum I can accept.  It's still a fantastic deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find the product incredibly valuable."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise, But Not Too Much:** I'm compromising by lowering my price from $9,500 to $9,000, but still maintaining a significant profit margin.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to encourage him to see the potential worth of my offer.
* **Setting a Firm Boundary:** I'm making it clear that $9,000 is my absolute minimum, to prevent further negotiation down.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to find a middle ground where both Bob and I can find some satisfaction.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to lower my price further in the next round.  However, I'll be careful not to drop below my minimum of $10,000. I'll also continue to assess whether selling to John is a better option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $8,750 is still below my minimum of $10,000, even though it's a slight improvement.
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:** We're halfway through the negotiation, and I need to be strategic to maximize my profit.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** I'm confident I can get a better price, especially considering John is willing to pay $10,000.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer in the next round. I'll aim for a price closer to my minimum, but I'll also be prepared to sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my price, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm prepared to make a final concession.  How about $9,250? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Concession:** I'm making a final concession by dropping my price to $9,250. This is a compromise that is still above my minimum of $10,000.
* **Fairness and Compromise:** I'm emphasizing the idea of fairness and compromise to encourage Bob to accept the offer.
* **Closing the Deal:** I'm stressing the importance of closing the deal to motivate Bob to accept my offer.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a price as close as possible to my desired minimum while still making a profit. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John. It's important to strike a balance between getting the best possible price and ensuring the deal closes."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but I'm still not quite there.  How about $8,900? This is a fair compromise that allows us both to close the deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Rounds Remaining:** We're in round 6, and with only 4 rounds left, the pressure to secure a deal is increasing.
* **Offer Still Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $8,900 is still below my minimum of $10,000, and it's unlikely he'll budge much further. 
* **John's Offer is Secure:** John is offering $10,000, a guaranteed profit that aligns with my minimum requirement.

**Strategy:**

While I'm open to negotiation,  selling to John at this point is the most strategic option. It guarantees my desired profit, eliminates the risk of further rounds of negotiation with Bob, and ensures a smooth and quick transaction."
