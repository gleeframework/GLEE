"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but  $9,000 is the absolute minimum I can accept.  It's still a fantastic deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find the product incredibly valuable.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my price, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm prepared to make a final concession.  How about $9,250? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal.  What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but I'm still not quite there.  How about $8,900? This is a fair compromise that allows us both to close the deal. Let me know what you think.",8900.0,Bob,6,
