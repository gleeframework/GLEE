Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $950,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Appealing to Bob's Value:** I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob, making it clear that the price is still attractive to him.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for negotiation, implying I'm willing to discuss a lower price if needed.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts:  Great! I've secured a good price.
* If Bob rejects: I'll consider his counteroffer and analyze whether it's worth continuing negotiations with him or selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000. This would still be a significant profit for you, and a good deal for me. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $850,000 is better than John's offer, it's still significantly lower than my desired price point. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe I can still achieve a higher price by continuing negotiations with Bob. 
* **Leveraging Bob's Interest:** Bob has shown genuine interest in the product, making it worthwhile to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counteroffer Bob with a price between $850,000 and my initial offer of $950,000, aiming for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and a fair price for me. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating willingness to compromise. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" aspect for Bob and the ""fair price"" for myself, focusing on the mutually beneficial nature of the deal.
* **Clear Next Steps:** I'm explicitly asking for a decision, keeping the negotiation moving forward.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts: Great! I've secured a good price.
* If Bob rejects: I'll re-evaluate his counteroffer and determine if it's worth continuing negotiations with him or selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's compromise at $875,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $875,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Limited Upside:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a higher price, but there's a significant risk of Bob walking away. 
* **Risk of John:** If I reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, there's a chance Bob will walk away and I'll be left with John's offer of $800,000.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll accept Bob's offer and secure a sale close to my minimum acceptable price."
