"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this truly unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this reflects its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while anchoring the discussion around a high number. 
* **Justification:**  Highlighting the product's ""uniqueness"" and ""potential"" subtly justifies the high price, even if those qualities are subjective.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm fully aware this offer is unlikely to be accepted outright, but it signals my intention to achieve a high sale price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is a significant amount, it's still considerably below my minimum acceptable price and my initial ask. I believe there's room for further negotiation. I'm willing to counter in the next round to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize your perspective on the value, the $1,200,000 figure doesn't fully reflect the unique aspects we discussed.  To move this forward, I could consider $1,450,000. This feels like a fair compromise."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Offer:** Showing that I've listened to his perspective can help keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Concession, but Firm:**  I'm lowering my price, but the drop is substantial enough to signal seriousness while still staying above my absolute minimum. 
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm gently reminding Bob of the ""unique aspects"" to subtly reinforce the product's worth.
* **Seeking Compromise:**  Framing my counteroffer as a compromise might encourage Bob to reciprocate with movement on his end."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering our previous discussions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now getting closer to a reasonable price point, but I'm still aiming to secure a higher amount. It's important to demonstrate that I'm not desperate to close the deal at any price, which strengthens my position.  I'll continue the negotiation to explore if there's potential for a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. $1,350,000 is getting closer, but we need to find a sweet spot. To be frank, walking away with anything under $1,400,000 significantly impacts other opportunities tied to this sale.  Can you meet me at that figure?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Building Rapport:** Acknowledging Bob's seriousness can foster a more collaborative tone.
* **Final Offer (For Now):** By presenting $1,400,000 with a sense of firmness and a plausible explanation (impacting other opportunities), I'm signaling this is my near-bottom line.
* **Direct Question:** Ending with a clear question encourages Bob to respond directly and potentially close the gap. 
* **Maintaining Walk-Away Option:** I'm still implicitly open to selling to John if Bob doesn't meet this offer, keeping my options open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,375,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,375,000 is very close to my desired price.  While I could push for the full $1,400,000, the difference now is relatively small.  Accepting this offer:

* **Secures a Strong Profit:**  $1,375,000 is significantly above my minimum and a very successful outcome.
* **Reduces Risk:**  Continuing negotiations always carries the risk of Bob walking away, leaving me with the $1,000,000 offer from John.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now provides immediate returns, whereas further haggling delays the benefit of the sale. 

This feels like the right moment to solidify the deal and ensure a positive outcome for both parties."
