"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this truly unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this reflects its true worth.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize your perspective on the value, the $1,200,000 figure doesn't fully reflect the unique aspects we discussed.  To move this forward, I could consider $1,450,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering our previous discussions.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. $1,350,000 is getting closer, but we need to find a sweet spot. To be frank, walking away with anything under $1,400,000 significantly impacts other opportunities tied to this sale.  Can you meet me at that figure?",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,375,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1375000.0,Bob,6,
