"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm prepared to pay $950,000 for this product.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product brings to your business.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $975,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset to my business. Let's close this deal.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite ready to meet you at $975,000, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to stay above my minimum value. I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000. This is my final compromise, and I'm confident it's a price that reflects the product's true value.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
