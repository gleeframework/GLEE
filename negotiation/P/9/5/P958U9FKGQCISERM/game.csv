"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10,000 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  It's a fair price, and I'm confident it will be a great investment for me.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this product.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9,500.  I'm still aiming to stay under $9,000.  Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $8,800?  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal.",8800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to stay under $9,000, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",9200.0,Alice,5,
