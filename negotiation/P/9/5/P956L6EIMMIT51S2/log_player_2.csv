"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll really like. I'm asking for $100 for it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than the product's worth to you ($100 vs $120).**  You want to save money.
* **You have a backup option with John.** This gives you leverage to negotiate with Alice. 
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer.**  This starts the negotiation process and gives you a chance to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm really interested in the product but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $90?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is lower than Alice's offer but still above her product value ($90 vs $80).** This gives Alice incentive to consider the counteroffer.
* **Counteroffer is close to your maximum value ($90 vs $120).**  You're trying to save as much as possible but still need to be realistic.
* **Message is friendly and shows interest in the product.** This helps to keep the negotiation positive."
