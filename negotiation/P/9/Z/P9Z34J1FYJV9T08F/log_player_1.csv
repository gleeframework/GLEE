"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $12,000 is a starting point that's significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm aiming to be friendly and positive while highlighting the value of the product for Bob.  This sets a good tone for the negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming to close the deal quickly, but I'm also willing to negotiate.
* The $12,000 offer is a compromise that balances my need to get a decent price with the potential to close a deal quickly.
* I'll be prepared to counteroffer if Bob rejects my initial offer. 
* If the negotiation stalls or doesn't seem promising, I have the option of selling to John for $15,000 as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $5,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is far too low.** $5,000 is significantly less than my minimum value of $15,000, and even less than the value of the product to Bob ($8,000).  Accepting this offer would be a major loss for me.
* **There's room for negotiation.** Bob is willing to pay more than $5,000, as evidenced by his initial rejection of my offer. 
* **I have a backup option.** I can still sell to John for $15,000, which is a much better outcome than accepting Bob's offer. 

**Strategy:**

* I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum value.
* I'll continue to aim for a price closer to $12,000 or above.
* If the negotiation doesn't lead to a satisfactory price, I'll sell to John as a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5,000 is quite a bit lower than what I can accept.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $9,000 is a significant increase from Bob's offer, demonstrating that I'm not willing to accept a low price. It's also a considerable step down from my initial offer of $12,000, showing willingness to compromise.
* **Message:**  The message remains friendly and focuses on finding a solution that works for both of us.  This helps keep the negotiation positive and avoids creating a standoff.

**Strategy:**

* **Finding a middle ground:** I'm aiming to find a price that is fair to both of us, within the range of $8,000 (Bob's value) and $15,000 (my minimum).
* **Building on the negotiation:** By making a counteroffer, I'm demonstrating my willingness to negotiate, which could lead to a successful outcome.
* **Staying open to other options:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to counteroffer again or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $7,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer and would save me a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.**  While it's a significant increase from his previous offer, it's still below the value of the product to him ($8,000) and far below my minimum value of $15,000.
* **There's room for negotiation.**  Bob is clearly willing to pay more, as shown by his increasing offers.
* **I have a better alternative.**  I can sell to John for $15,000, which is a much more favorable outcome.

**Strategy:**

* I will counteroffer Bob with a price that's closer to my minimum value.  This will demonstrate that I'm serious about getting a fair price and will help push the negotiation in the right direction. 
* If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I'll consider the possibility of selling to John. However, I'll try to continue negotiating with Bob for a few more rounds before making a final decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This would be a fair compromise and allow us to both benefit from the transaction.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  $11,000 is a significant increase from Bob's offer and shows that I am not willing to settle for a low price. However, it's still a step down from my previous offer of $9,000, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Message:**  I'm emphasizing the fairness of the offer, focusing on a win-win situation for both of us. This helps maintain a positive negotiation tone.

**Strategy:**

* **Closing the gap:** I'm trying to narrow the gap between our desired prices, moving closer to a potential agreement.
* **Staying firm:** I'm not willing to go significantly lower than $11,000, as it's still above Bob's stated value and closer to my minimum.
* **Balancing options:** I'm prepared to continue negotiating, but I'm also aware that I can sell to John for $15,000 if necessary."
