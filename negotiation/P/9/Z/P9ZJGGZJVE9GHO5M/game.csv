"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you is $800,000, but I'm willing to make a concession to get the deal done.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000.
