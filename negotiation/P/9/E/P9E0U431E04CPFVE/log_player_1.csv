"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200, which is a significant markup from my minimum value. This allows for some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good return."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$60 is far too low for me.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $120. This is still a good profit for me, but it's a significant reduction from my initial offer, showing flexibility. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come closer to a price I'm willing to accept."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $80 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}

While $90 is getting closer, I'm still going to reject Bob's offer.  I'm hoping that with a few more rounds, I can push him closer to my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}

We're running out of time and Bob's offers are not getting close enough to my minimum value. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $150."
