"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really be interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $90. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $100 for the product. Alice is offering it for $90. While that's a good deal, it's still more than you'd ideally like to pay. Since you can get the product from John for $100, it's better to reject Alice's offer and buy it from John."
