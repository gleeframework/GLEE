{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $200. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

This offer starts at a price higher than your minimum ($150) to give you room for negotiation. It also includes a friendly message to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

``` 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price. While it's tempting to take $120, it's better to try and get closer to your desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $120 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $175. This is a great deal for a product of this quality, and I'm confident you won't regret it. "", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the product is high-quality, but $175 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $150 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $150 is your minimum acceptable price.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee that Bob will budge, and you risk losing the sale entirely.  Accepting his offer ensures you get your minimum value and don't have to deal with the uncertainty of more negotiation."
