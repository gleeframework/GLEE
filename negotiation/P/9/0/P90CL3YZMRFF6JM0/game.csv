"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you acknowledging the product's value to me. However, $14,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500, which is still a fair price considering your value for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. To try to meet in the middle, I would like to propose a price of $13,750 for the product. This is a bit higher than your offer but lower than my initial proposal, aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement.",13750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,750 is still a bit outside my budget.  Let's split the difference and meet at $13,125. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to purchase the product while still ensuring you receive a reasonable profit.",13125.0,Bob,4,
