"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. This is a great deal, considering its worth to me is at least $1000000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than what you're willing to pay from John, so it's worth trying to negotiate further.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to come up on her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product,  $950,000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable paying at this time.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for it. This represents a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential value of this product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to invest in this product. However, I'm not quite ready to accept your offer of $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1100000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value I place on the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still a good deal compared to buying from John for $1,500,000.  It's also likely that further negotiation will be time-consuming and might not result in a significantly lower price. Accepting Alice's offer saves time and money."
