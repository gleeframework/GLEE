"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. This is a great deal, considering its worth to me is at least $1000000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product,  $950000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable paying at this time.  I'm willing to offer $1200000 for it. This represents a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential value of this product.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to invest in this product. However, I'm not quite ready to accept your offer of $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1100000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value I place on the product. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
