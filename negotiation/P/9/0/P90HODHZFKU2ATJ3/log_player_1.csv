Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product,  $950000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable paying at this time.  I'm willing to offer $1200000 for it. This represents a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential value of this product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
