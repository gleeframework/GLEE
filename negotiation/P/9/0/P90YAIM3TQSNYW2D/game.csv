"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but  $11,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're close to making a decision, Bob, but I'm not willing to go up to $9,500 just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,250. It's a compromise, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",10250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm trying to be reasonable, but $10,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $9,750. That's my final offer. If it doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options.",9750.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're trying to be reasonable, Bob, but I'm not willing to go down to $9,750. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,200. It's my final offer, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",10200.0,Alice,7,
