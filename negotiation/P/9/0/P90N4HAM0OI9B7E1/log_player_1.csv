Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $725,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my ideal price, I believe I can still get a higher price by continuing the negotiation."

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $730,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price, the risk of losing the deal and having to sell to John for $800,000 is too great. $730,000 is a good compromise and a reasonable outcome."
