Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get him to make a counteroffer closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $180
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is better than selling to John, but I think I can get closer to my desired price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 190}
```

I'm countering with $190. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but still aim for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $175
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now closer to my minimum. While I'd prefer to get closer to $190, it's not worth risking further negotiation.  I'll accept his offer and sell the product for $175."
