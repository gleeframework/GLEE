{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $140 is still higher than Bob's perceived value of $120, giving him an incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** $140 is still above your minimum of $150, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** This makes it easy for Bob to understand and respond. 

By offering $140, you're showing that you're willing to negotiate but also that you value the product. This approach sets the stage for a successful negotiation."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is above Bob's perceived value, it's below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $130 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand the value of the product and your need to make a profit. However, I am still looking to stay within my budget. Could we possibly agree on $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is insistent on $130, which is still below my minimum price. While I could continue negotiating, the risk of getting stuck at an unfavorable price is too high.  It's better to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $150."
