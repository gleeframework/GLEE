"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $8,500? It's still a great price for you considering the value of the product. Let me know your thoughts.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $8,000. This is my final offer, so let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8000.0,Bob,4,
