Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000.  Offering it slightly below this gives him a good deal while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can then decide if you want to go slightly lower.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** While you could aim for an even higher price, there's a chance Bob might reject it outright. This offer balances the risk of losing him as a buyer with the potential for a higher profit margin.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $800,000 from John, providing a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
