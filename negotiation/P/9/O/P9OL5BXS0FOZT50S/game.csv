"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is outside my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $900,000.  Let me know if that's a price we can work with.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  $900,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm open to  $1,050,000.  This price still leaves room for both of us to benefit. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about $950,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal. ",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. $950,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value. It's a good deal for both of us. Let's finalize this.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
