"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, and you have a guaranteed alternative with John for $150, there's no reason to negotiate with Alice.  There's a chance Alice will refuse your counteroffers, leading to a longer negotiation process and potentially no deal at all.  Buying from John is the most efficient and risk-free option."
