Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to sell it for $180. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 180
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation or allows you to appear generous if you decide to lower the price slightly. 
* **Gauging Interest:** By offering the product at $180, you're testing Bob's interest. If he accepts, you've made a great deal. If he rejects, you can always fall back to John's offer of $150. 
* **Respectful Tone:** The message maintains a polite and respectful tone, acknowledging that Bob is the first choice buyer."
