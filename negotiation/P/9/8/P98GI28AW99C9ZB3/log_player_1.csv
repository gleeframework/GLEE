Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice. However, I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me.

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear it's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly closer to my minimum. John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is a fair deal and avoids further negotiation."
