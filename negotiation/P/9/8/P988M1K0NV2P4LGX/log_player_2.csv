"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm hoping to get the product for a little less. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. Is this a price you'd be comfortable with? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,050,000 is still within Bob's budget of $1,200,000 and represents a good deal compared to buying from John. It's a better price than her initial offer, and Bob can save $50,000.  Accepting the offer is the best option at this point."
