"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in this product, but $15000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'd be willing to pay $10000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $10,000 is significantly lower than what I need to accept.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $13000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $11500.  Let's try to bridge the gap and find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can do better. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $11,500 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway again,  and propose $12,500. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement this time."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $12500 is a step in the right direction, I'm still hoping to find a price a bit lower. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach a final agreement this time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 is my minimum price, but I've already been through 5 rounds of negotiation.  It's getting late in the game, and I'm not sure if I can push him higher.  To ensure I get at least my minimum, I'm going to sell to John."
