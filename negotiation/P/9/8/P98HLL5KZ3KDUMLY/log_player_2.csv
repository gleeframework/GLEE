"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. I know this is a significant investment, but I believe it holds incredible value for you, just as it does for me.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since you are willing to pay up to $1,000,000 for the product, and John is offering it for that price, it's the most logical choice. There's no advantage to accepting Alice's offer as it's the same price."
