Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

This offer starts high, aiming to maximize profit. I'm aware of the $1,000,000 floor, so I'm still leaving room for negotiation if needed.  Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my desired price range, but I can likely squeeze out a bit more. I'll reject and try to counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm coming down a bit from my initial price, but still leaving some room for negotiation while staying above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd love to get even closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer is now within a reasonable range and significantly better than selling to John. It's time to close the deal."
