"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating.  Since Bob values the product at $120, there's room to bargain.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to get closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm happy to pay $90 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation. It also signals to Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product, but is looking for a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell it to you for $95. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. Bob can likely get a better deal by rejecting this offer and making another counteroffer. The goal is to get as close to $90 as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $95.  Would you be willing to come down to $92? That seems like a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 92}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer continues to show Bob's willingness to negotiate while still being reasonable. It's a small step closer to Alice's previous offer, showing a willingness to compromise.  This approach keeps the negotiation moving forward without sacrificing too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell it to you for $93. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $93. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $93
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made a significant concession, coming down to $93. This is a good price for Bob, as it is within his budget and only slightly higher than his last counteroffer.  It's likely that further negotiation won't yield a significantly better price, and risking going to John could result in paying $120. Accepting the offer secures a good deal while minimizing risk."
