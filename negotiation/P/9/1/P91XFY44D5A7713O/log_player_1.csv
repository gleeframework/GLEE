"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, I am looking to keep my investment within $1,000,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to $1,000,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to sell now, I believe I can still get a better price by continuing negotiations. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $1,000,000 is a good offer, it's a bit lower than what I was hoping for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still represents a great deal for you, given the value you see in the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,050,000, Alice. While I respect your valuation of the product, I'm still aiming to keep my investment within $1,000,000. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle at $1,025,000? This would allow us both to feel satisfied with the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's counteroffer of $1,025,000 is close enough to my minimum acceptable value. Accepting this offer allows me to avoid the risk of further negotiations and potentially losing the deal altogether."
