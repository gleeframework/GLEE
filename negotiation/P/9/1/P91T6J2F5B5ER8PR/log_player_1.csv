Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's closer to my minimum value of $10,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still maximizing my potential profit.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to consider my offer.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product, even though he already knows it's worth $8,000 to him. This might make him more willing to pay a little extra. 

**Strategy:**

* I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not giving away the product for less than my minimum value. 
* If Bob rejects my offer, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worth negotiating further. 
* I'm always aware of my fallback option (selling to John for $10,000), which gives me leverage during the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay up to $9,000 for the product. Please let me know if this is within your range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer is Close:** Bob's offer is close to my minimum price, but I'm not willing to settle just yet. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I believe there's still room for me to get a better price by counteroffering. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I'm confident I can push for a higher price by staying firm and using my option to sell to John as leverage.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'll send Bob a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to $9,500. 
* **Negotiation:** I'll be prepared to negotiate further if needed, but I won't let the price drop below my minimum acceptable value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a slightly higher price. How about $9,250? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm counteroffering at $9,250, which is closer to my desired price but still within a reasonable range for Bob. 
* **Finding Common Ground:** I'm emphasizing that this price is still a good deal for him and that I'm willing to negotiate. This encourages him to consider my offer seriously.
* **Maintain Leverage:** I'm not revealing my absolute minimum price, keeping my fallback option (selling to John) as a bargaining chip.

**Strategy:**

* By making a counteroffer, I'm demonstrating my willingness to compromise while still trying to maximize my profits.
* I'm hoping Bob will accept this counteroffer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary.
* I'll carefully consider Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I am still not comfortable going above $9,000. Can we meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,125 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $9,000. 
* **Time Factor:** Further negotiation might take longer, and I'm not sure if I can secure a better price.
* **Avoiding Risk:** While I could potentially get a slightly higher price, there's also a risk that Bob might walk away completely.

**Strategy:**

* Accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible decision at this point. 
*  It secures a sale that is close to my minimum, and minimizes the risk of losing the deal altogether.
* I'll need to consider if it's worth pursuing further negotiations with Bob in the future for similar products."
