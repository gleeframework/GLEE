"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you my product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $18,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course!"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer of $14,000 is significantly closer to my minimum price. While I could push for more, there's a risk of losing the deal altogether.
