"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. $10,000 is quite low, but I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. While $17,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. Could you consider something closer to $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, it seems like we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $11,500 is still too low for me.  How about $15,500? This is my final offer.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your flexibility. I understand that $11,500 is a significant decrease, and I appreciate you working with me. While $15,500 is still a bit higher than I hoped, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you consider $13,500?",13500.0,Bob,6,
