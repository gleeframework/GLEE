"I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $900,000? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm and your offer, but $900,000 is unfortunately too far below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $1,050,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I truly believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to come down, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the market value is $1,200,000 to you.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
