"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We're aiming for the best possible price, so we begin significantly above both your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** This high initial price provides a buffer for negotiation and allows us to gradually lower the price if needed, while still aiming for a final price above your minimum.
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's ""unique value and potential"" to justify the high initial asking price. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's Interest:** His response will reveal how interested he is and how much he might be willing to pay.
2. **Maximize Potential Profit:**  We can always come down in price, but we can never go back up after setting an initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the current market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is closer to our target range, it's still significantly higher than his perceived value of $1,200,000. This indicates room for negotiation. We are willing to go lower, but not to $1,800,000 just yet. 

Selling to John at $1,500,000 is our fallback option, and we're not there yet.  We'll use the next round to try and close the gap with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the market. However, the value of this product, especially given its unique features, goes beyond typical market conditions.  I could consider $2,000,000.  This is a significant price reduction, reflecting my willingness to make a deal, but it also recognizes the true worth of what's on offer."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're coming down in price ($300,000 reduction) but not drastically. This shows we're open to negotiation but are still aiming high.
* **Highlighting Value:** We're reiterating the product's unique aspects to justify a price above Bob's initial offer.
* **Creating Urgency:** By mentioning a ""significant price reduction,"" we subtly create a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously. 

We are moving closer to your minimum price, but we want to see if we can get closer to $1,900,000 before considering accepting an offer in that range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the reduction, but I'm still not convinced that $2,000,000 is a fair price. I'd like to meet in the middle at $1,900,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now at $1,900,000, which is a significant price and a good profit margin above your $1,500,000 minimum. While we might be able to push for a bit more, the difference is no longer significant enough to risk losing the deal entirely. 

Accepting at $1,900,000 secures a strong profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
