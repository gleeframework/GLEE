"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your needs. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I think it's a fair starting point given its potential, but I'm open to discussing what makes sense for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I understand the value of the product, but I'm only willing to go up to $900,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 undervalues the product significantly, especially considering its potential for someone like you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This price reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your interest.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still not quite there with $1,025,000. How about we split the difference and go with $962,500? It's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal.",962500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair deal, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. While I appreciate your willingness to move, the product's value to someone with your needs truly is in the higher range. Could you consider $1,000,000? This feels like a strong offer on my end, and I hope it demonstrates my commitment to making this work.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, which is a good compromise and reflects the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can finalize a deal here.",975000.0,Bob,6,
