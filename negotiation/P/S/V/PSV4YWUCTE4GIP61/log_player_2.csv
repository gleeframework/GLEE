Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your commitment to your budget, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $10,600. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.

Alice has signaled this is her final offer, and while it's not ideal, it's better than John's price. It's unlikely she'll go lower and we risk missing out on the deal entirely if we push further."
