"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $10,000?",10200.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $11,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch. Could you consider $10,500? I think that's a fair compromise.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $10,750. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",10750.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the continued negotiation. $10,750 is very close, but I'm trying to stay strictly within a $10,500 budget.  Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",10500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand your commitment to your budget, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $10,600. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",10600.0,Alice,7,
