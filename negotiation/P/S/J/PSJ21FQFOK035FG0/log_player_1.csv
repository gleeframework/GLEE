"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll love it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This allows for room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** My message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob. 
* **Open-Ended Question:** I end with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to engage in the conversation. 

This strategy aims to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get him to make a counteroffer. If he rejects, I'll have a better idea of his perceived value of the product and can adjust my offers accordingly."
