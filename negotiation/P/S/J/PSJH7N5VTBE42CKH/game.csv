"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $90? I think that's a fair price that reflects its value to me.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $110 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. I think this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me.",105.0,Alice,3,
