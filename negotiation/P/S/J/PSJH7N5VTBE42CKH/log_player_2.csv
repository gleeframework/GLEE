"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Reason:While $110 is close to my limit, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell. I'll try a counteroffer to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $90? I think that's a fair price that reflects its value to me."", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $110 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. I think this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Reason: Alice met me halfway.  $105 is a reasonable price, and continuing to negotiate might make me lose the deal entirely."
