"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $925000? I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",925000.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $887500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll give you a slightly more generous offer. How about $910000? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it's still a good deal for you.",910000.0,Alice,5,,
