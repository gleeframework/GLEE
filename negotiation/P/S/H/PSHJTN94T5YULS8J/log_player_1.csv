I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum desired price of $15,000, but still leaves me a reasonable profit.  I believe it's a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see if we can negotiate a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate,  $12,000 is significantly lower than my minimum desired price. I will reject his offer and see if we can come to a more agreeable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering $13,000.  This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between our previous offers.  Hopefully, this is a price we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm concerned that further negotiations might lead to a drawn-out process with no guarantee of a satisfactory outcome.  Given that John is willing to pay my minimum desired price, I will sell the product to John for $15,000."
