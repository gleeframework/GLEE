"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. Let's talk."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Opening high:** Starting with a high price allows for room to negotiate and gives me a strong starting point. 
* **Value proposition:** Highlighting the ""fantastic opportunity"" and ""valuable asset"" subtly reminds Bob of the product's worth. 
* **Open to discussion:** Ending with ""Let's talk"" shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.

**Note:** While this price is above Bob's perceived value, the negotiations haven't begun yet. I am aiming to maximize my potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering me as a potential buyer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to offer $950,000 for it. I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000**.  While it's closer than his initial rejection, it's not enough to consider selling at this point.
* **I have time to negotiate.** We're only in round 2, and I have 8 rounds remaining before I have to decide on selling to John. 
* **I can potentially get a better offer.** I believe I can still get closer to my target price by continuing the negotiation process. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm determined to get a higher price and I'm not desperate to sell. This can put pressure on Bob to increase his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a price closer to $1,100,000.  This product holds significant value, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. Let's continue discussing."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer within a reasonable range:**  I'm lowering my initial offer slightly to show flexibility but still staying above my minimum price. 
* **Maintain the value proposition:**  I reiterate the product's significant value to emphasize my point.
* **Openness to negotiation:**  I end with ""Let's continue discussing"" to signal I'm willing to work with Bob to find a solution.

**Goal:**

* To continue the negotiation and explore if Bob is willing to move closer to my target price.
*  To gauge Bob's seriousness and potential for reaching a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I am still unable to meet the price of $1,100,000. I would like to propose an offer of $1,050,000. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.** This means I'm already securing a profit on the sale.
* **We're nearing the end of the negotiation.**  We're in round 4, and I have 6 rounds remaining before I need to decide on selling to John.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could potentially get a higher price by continuing, there's a risk that Bob will walk away or continue to haggle, and I might end up with less than $1,050,000. 

**Overall:** Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick sale at a price that meets my minimum requirements. It's a good compromise and a reasonable outcome considering the negotiation process."
