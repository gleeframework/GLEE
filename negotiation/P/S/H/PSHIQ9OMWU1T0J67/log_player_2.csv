"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is within your budget, it's still a bit higher than you'd like to pay.  You have room to negotiate, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $95, which is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer of $110. This shows Alice that I'm serious about getting a good deal.  It's still a fair price for both of us, considering my maximum budget of $120 and her minimum price of $80."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $105, which is within my budget and a significant improvement from her initial offer. While I could try to push for a lower price, I risk losing the deal entirely.  It's important to weigh the potential savings against the risk of losing a good deal.  Accepting the offer at $105 guarantees I get the product at a decent price within my budget."
