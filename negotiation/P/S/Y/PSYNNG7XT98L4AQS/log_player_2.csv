"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $1,300,000. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic product at a discounted price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is less than her product's worth to her, it's still more expensive than John's offer of $1,200,000. You can save $100,000 by rejecting Alice's offer and going with John."
