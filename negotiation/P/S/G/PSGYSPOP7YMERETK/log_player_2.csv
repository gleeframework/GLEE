"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You value the product at $15,000, and Alice is offering it for $12,000. This means you can potentially save $3,000.
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can try to get a lower price from Alice.
* **Buying from John is a backup plan.** If the negotiation with Alice fails, you can always buy from John for $15,000.

**Next steps:** You will make a counteroffer to Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $11000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice has moved closer to your desired price.** Her offer of $11,000 is only $1,000 more than your counteroffer of $10,000.
* **You are still saving money.** You can purchase the product for $11,000, which is $4,000 less than what John is selling it for. 
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to get you a significantly lower price.**  You've already made a counteroffer, and Alice is likely willing to compromise but not go much lower. 

**Conclusion:** Accepting Alice's offer is the best option to maximize savings."
