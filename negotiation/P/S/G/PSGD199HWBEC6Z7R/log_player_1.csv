Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be extremely valuable to you.  While I can't disclose specifics about its worth, I can assure you it's worth at least $800,000 to me.  I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000.  I'm confident you'll see the potential it holds, and I'm willing to negotiate further if needed.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,000,000, significantly higher than my minimum value. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob shows interest but wants a lower price.
* **Focus on Value:** I highlight the potential value to Bob, not just my own valuation. This can pique his interest.
* **Open to Negotiation:** By saying ""willing to negotiate further,"" I signal flexibility and make Bob more likely to engage in a conversation. 

This approach aims to:

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** I'm aiming for a higher price than John's offer.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This offer will reveal how much Bob values the product.  
* **Open a Dialogue:** If Bob counters, it allows me to explore his perceived value and potentially reach a mutually beneficial price."
