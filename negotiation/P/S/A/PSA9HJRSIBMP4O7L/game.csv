"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure if it's a fair deal for you. Let me know if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $900,000 is a good starting point, it's a bit too low for me.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a great deal for you. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,000,000, so I'll offer $950,000. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
