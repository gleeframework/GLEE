Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, potentially saving you considerable costs and increasing efficiency. I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This offer stands for 24 hours. "",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to $1,500,000 (John's offer) as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering it slightly below John's price creates room for negotiation while still exceeding Bob's perceived value.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Entice Bob:** The price is significantly higher than his valuation, but the message emphasizes potential benefits and time sensitivity.
2. **Potential Counter-Offer:** This might lead Bob to counter-offer, potentially getting us closer to $1,500,000. 
3. **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, we have a guaranteed sale with John at our desired price."
