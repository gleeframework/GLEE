"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is less than Alice's asking price of $12,000, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product but $9,000 is a bit more than I can afford right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,500?  That would be a great price for me and I'd be happy to close the deal today."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,750. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $8,750 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his limit.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob another opportunity to negotiate a price closer to his desired $8,000.  He can also use the fact that John is offering the product for $8,000 as leverage in future negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $8,750 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in the product and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $8,250?  This is a fair compromise and would allow us to close the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,250. I'm willing to come down another $100 to $8,600. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,600 is very close to Bob's maximum budget, it's still above it.  Bob has already demonstrated a willingness to negotiate and knows that John is offering the product for $8,000. Rejecting this offer gives Bob one more opportunity to push for a better price, or to walk away and buy from John if Alice doesn't budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm very close to finalizing this deal, $8,600 is still just a bit too high for my budget.  I'm confident that if we compromise a little further we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. Would you be willing to come down to $8,400?  This would be a fair price, and I'd be able to purchase the product from you immediately."", ""product_price"": 8400}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,400. I'm willing to come down another $100 to $8,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has reached a point where further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to yield a price lower than his $8,000 budget.  Alice has shown a willingness to come down slightly, but not enough to meet Bob's target. 

Given that John is offering the product for Bob's maximum budget, it's more prudent for Bob to purchase from John and avoid further negotiation with Alice. This decision ensures that Bob gets the product at the best possible price within his budget."
