,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $14,500 is already a competitive price for this product. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is my final offer.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,500. That's the lowest I can go.",11500.0,Bob,4,
