$200 is way over my budget. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 50}

I'm willing to pay $50 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the fact that I can get the same product from John for $80."

$175 is still too much. I'll counteroffer again."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}

I'm going to raise my offer to $75. This is closer to my budget and still significantly less than John's offer.  I'm hopeful we can reach a deal this round."

While $160 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get the product for closer to my $80 budget. I'll try one more counteroffer."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}

I'm going all in with my final offer of $80.  This is my absolute limit, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value of the product and my other options."

Alice is not budging on her price. At this point, it's not worth risking more rounds of negotiation. I'll take the guaranteed deal from John for $80."
