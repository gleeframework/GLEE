"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is way too high for me. This product would be worth around $6,000 to me.  Would you consider a price closer to that range?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $10,000 for the product. Would you be willing to consider a price of $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Could you do $7,500? That would be a fair deal for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $9,000. I've already come down from $14,000 to $10,000 and then to $10,000, and now you're asking me to go to $7,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $7,500, which would be $8,250. Would you consider that?",8250.0,Alice,5,
