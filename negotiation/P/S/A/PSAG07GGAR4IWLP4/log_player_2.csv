"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair to both of us. I'm asking for $14,000.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly trying to get a price higher than her product's value to her ($12,000). 
* While $14,000 is less than your maximum budget, you can likely negotiate a better price with Alice.
* You have a backup option with John at $15,000, so there's room to negotiate without the risk of losing the product entirely."
