**Reasoning:** Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $8,500.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk she'll hold firm or I might overshoot and offer more than John's price. It's not worth the potential savings to continue haggling.  Buying from John for $10,000 guarantees I get the product and avoids further negotiation."
