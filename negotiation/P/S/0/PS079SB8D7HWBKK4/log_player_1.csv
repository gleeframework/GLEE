{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $135. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}

This offer starts with a price slightly higher than Bob's value, leaving room for negotiation. It also includes a friendly message to encourage a positive response.  I'm aiming for a compromise that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $125 is a better price than Bob's initial value, it's still below my minimum value of $150. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $130?  That's closer to your offer and still a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```

I'm offering $130, which is the midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to compromise. I'm aiming for a deal that benefits both of us, while still ensuring I receive a reasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go down to $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is unwilling to move significantly on his price, and I'm not comfortable selling for $125. It's time to cut my losses and move on to a guaranteed sale with John."
