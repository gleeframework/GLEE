"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am unable to meet the price of $1,000,000 for the product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $975,000?  This price is fair considering the value of the product, and it's still lower than my original offer.  I believe this is a good opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I must stick to my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $960,000. I believe this price is fair for both parties and allows me to stay within my financial constraints.",960000.0,Bob,4,
