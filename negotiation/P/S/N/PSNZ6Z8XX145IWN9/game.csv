"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that said, I'm willing to start with an offer of $1000000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a great starting point for our negotiation.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is worth more than $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900000. This is a fair compromise that I believe will benefit both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $900000. I'd be willing to go up to $850000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle again.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $950000. I believe the product's value to me is worth more than that.
