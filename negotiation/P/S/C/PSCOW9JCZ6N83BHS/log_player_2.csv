"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Since your maximum value for the product is $100, and Alice is offering it for $100, it's in your best interest to accept the offer. Buying from John would result in the same price, so there's no advantage to rejecting Alice's offer."
