"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $22,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $18,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",18000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about we meet in the middle at $20,000? This offer reflects the true value of the product.",20000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $20,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $17,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget constraints.",17000.0,Bob,4,
