"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering its value to me.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $10500?  This still leaves some room for profit for you, and allows me to get closer to my desired price.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9200? I'm willing to meet you halfway between our prices.",9200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $9200 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $9800? This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with.",9800.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9000? I'm willing to make one more compromise to get to a price that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,6,
