"Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $120 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $145. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",145.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $145 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $130. If you're serious about selling, let's meet in the middle.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $130. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll sell it to you for $140. That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",140.0,Alice,5,
