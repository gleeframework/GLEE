"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, it's Alice. I'm happy to discuss the sale of this excellent product. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to negotiate. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is far above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's crucial to start the negotiation by rejecting this offer and showing Alice you're serious about a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer. While I recognize the value of this product, $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 as a starting point for negotiation. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I see in the product."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Counteroffer:**  A $700,000 drop from Alice's initial price demonstrates a strong desire to negotiate and sets a clear boundary.
* **Realistic Price:**  $1,100,000 is still within your budget, allowing room for potential compromise.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message acknowledges the product's value but emphasizes your financial limitations, creating a positive tone for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider. This product offers substantial value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer reflects that. How about we meet halfway? I propose $1,450,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still significantly above your budget.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation moving and allows you to continue pushing for a price closer to your target.  You can use this round to explore further compromises and work towards a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,450,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's split the difference:  I'm proposing $1,275,000.  This reflects the value of the product while staying within my financial constraints."", ""product_price"": 1275000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway (Again):** By proposing a price that's the midpoint between your previous offer and Alice's offer, you demonstrate a willingness to compromise.
* **Staying Within Budget:**  This offer is still within your budget, but pushes you closer to your limit, leaving less room for further concessions.
* **Positive but Firm:** The message uses a positive tone while expressing a clear stance on your budget limitations."
