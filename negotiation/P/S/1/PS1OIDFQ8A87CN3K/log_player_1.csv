Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly beneficial to you.  I'm asking for $10,000, given its value."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still achieve a price above your baseline. 
* **Justification:** While simply stating a price is an option, briefly mentioning the product's value might make Bob more receptive to a higher price. 
* **Leaving Room:** Offering a price of $10,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down. Even if he negotiates, you're likely to secure a price higher than your guaranteed $8,000 from John.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters."
