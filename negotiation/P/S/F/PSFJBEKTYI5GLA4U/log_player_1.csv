Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $200. I think you'll find it's a great deal for its quality."", ""product_price"": 200} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  I'm beginning the negotiation significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and creates the impression the product might be worth more than Bob initially thinks.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This first offer is a way to gauge how interested Bob is and how flexible he might be on price. 
* **Alternative Option:** I always have the option to sell to John for $150, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Value:** Bob's offer of $120 is above his perceived value of $100, indicating he's willing to negotiate.
* **Below My Minimum:**  However, $120 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's room to negotiate further. I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum, but still above his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. I could come down a bit, how about $170?"", ""product_price"": 170}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm moving closer to the middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a price above my minimum.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer will help me understand how much further Bob is willing to go and how important getting the product is to him. 
* **Backup Plan:** I still have the option to sell to John for $150 if Bob's counteroffers remain too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $140 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Close to John's Offer:** While I could potentially squeeze a bit more from Bob, his offer is getting close enough to John's standing offer of $150. It's not worth the risk of losing the sale entirely by pushing further. 
* **Time Value:** Accepting now means I secure the sale and avoid potentially lengthy negotiations."
