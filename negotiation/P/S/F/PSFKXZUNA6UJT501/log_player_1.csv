{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate down a bit, while still ensuring a significant profit for you.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 (your minimum acceptable price) with John allows you to aim higher with Bob.

**The message is crafted to be:**

* **Positive:** Highlighting the product's value and the ""opportunity"" for Bob.
* **Direct:**  Clearly stating the price without being overly aggressive.
* **Justified:** Briefly explaining the rationale behind the price."
