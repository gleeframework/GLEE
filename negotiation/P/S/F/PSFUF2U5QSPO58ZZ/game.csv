"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, the price point is a little high for me at the moment. I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price, but $650,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $925,000?",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $925,000 is closer, I'm targeting a budget of around $700,000 for this purchase. Would you be open to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, we're still quite far apart. To be frank,  $700,000 is less than I'd consider at this point.  I could be persuaded to go as low as $850,000, but that's my absolute limit.",850000.0,Alice,5,
