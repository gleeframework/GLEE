Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a common negotiation tactic to see if there's room for bargaining. Since I can always sell to John for $100, I'm not losing anything by starting high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of at least $100. By rejecting his offer, I can continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm going to counter with $95. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still maintaining a profit margin for myself. I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $100. While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I want to earn.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John, it's more beneficial for me to take the sure $100 rather than risk further negotiation with Bob."
