"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,001. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,001
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is starting with a price that's only $1 more than what you're willing to pay from John.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  There's a good chance she'll be willing to come down a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within a reasonable range.  This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still ensuring I'm getting a good deal.  I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my maximum threshold, but still leaves some room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,005. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,005
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has only come down by $4 from her initial offer, which is not a significant enough reduction. I'm still willing to negotiate further and see if I can get a better price.  I'm not ready to buy from John yet, as there's still room to improve the deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1175000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, but still keeping it below my maximum threshold. This shows Alice that I'm serious about negotiating, but also that I'm not willing to pay her full asking price. I'm hoping this will encourage her to come down to a more reasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,010. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,010
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high, and she's only come down by $5 from her previous offer. I'm still willing to negotiate further, but I'm starting to feel like she might not be willing to budge much. I'm not ready to buy from John yet, as I still have some room to improve the deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1190000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high, but I am trying to find a price that is acceptable to both of us. I am increasing my counteroffer slightly, but still keeping it below my maximum threshold.  I am hoping that this will incentivize Alice to come down in price, but I'm not ready to buy from John yet."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,015. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,015
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is only $15 lower than her initial offer, and it's becoming clear that she's not willing to come down much further.  With only a few rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to buy from John. While it's not the absolute lowest price, it's within my budget, and buying from John guarantees I'll get the product."
