"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the price of $9,500. Considering the product's worth to me is $15,000, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $11,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality product at a fair price. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand your position, but I still feel that $9,500 represents a fair value for the product. I would like to stick to this price point. If we cannot agree on this, I will consider buying the product from John for $8,000.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. Considering the product's worth to me is $15,000, I'm willing to make a new counteroffer of $10,800. This is a compromise that I believe is fair and reasonable. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a deal. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,5,
