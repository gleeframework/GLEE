"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe it's well worth the price. Let me know your thoughts. If you decline, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd prefer to work with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:** Alice is offering the product for $1,400,000, which is less than John's price of $1,500,000.
* **Alice's offer is within your budget:** You are willing to pay up to $1,500,000, and Alice's offer is below that.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer saves you $100,000 compared to buying from John."
