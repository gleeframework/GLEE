The product is far above Bob's budget. It makes sense to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."

While $13,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price.  He should continue negotiating to try and get a better deal."

While the price is getting closer to Bob's budget, he's still willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if he can get a better deal.  He's already shown a willingness to increase his offer, but still has room to move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, showing his commitment to buying the product while still trying to get a better price.  He's hoping Alice will see that he's serious and be willing to accept a deal closer to his desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Bob has negotiated the price down to $12,000. However, this is still higher than his maximum budget of $8,000. He has shown a willingness to negotiate and has increased his offer multiple times, but Alice seems unwilling to go lower.  It's in Bob's best interest to buy from John for his desired price and save time and effort."
