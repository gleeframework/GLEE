"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a better deal than $15,000,  Bob can still save money. It's worth attempting a counteroffer to see if he can get closer to his $10,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to his $10,000 limit.  He's offering $11,000, which is still a profit for Alice, but a significant discount from her initial offer. This counteroffer shows that Bob is serious about getting a good deal but is willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $11,500 is still a bit more than Bob wants to pay, but it's only $500 more than his ideal price.  He has two options now: 

* **Accept:**  He gets the product for a price that's slightly higher than his limit, but it's a decent deal.
* **Reject and Counter:** There's a risk that Alice will keep rejecting offers, and Bob could end up spending more time negotiating and possibly missing out on the product.

Considering the time investment and the potential for further negotiation to stall, accepting the offer is the most practical decision in this scenario."
