"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a little high for me. How about $800,000? I think that's a fair price that considers its value.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price that still reflects the product's value to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you moving closer to my price range, Alice. While $1,100,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. Could we agree on $950,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you considering the product's value.
