Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum value of $80 but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm aiming for a price closer to the $150 value Bob places on the product. Let's see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is more than what John would pay, it's still below the value I placed on the product ($80). I believe I can get a better price by countering Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer, but still staying below my ideal price. This keeps the negotiation moving forward, and hopefully, we can find a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $105 is a good compromise. It's higher than John's offer and within my acceptable range. I'm willing to accept it and sell the product to Bob."
