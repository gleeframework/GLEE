"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm  very interested in your product, and I'm prepared to offer you $850,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While I value your business, $850,000 is unfortunately not a price I can accept.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000,  which still represents a significant value for you. This is my final offer. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm very serious about buying your product, and I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. I believe it's in our best interest to finalize this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
