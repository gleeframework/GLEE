Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Focus on Value:** I subtly highlight the product's worth to Bob, making the offer seem more attractive. 

This strategy balances the need to maximize my profit with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer.  I can always fall back on John's offer if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm  very interested in your product, and I'm prepared to offer you $850,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $850,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  
* **Opportunity for Higher Price:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'm willing to explore a counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my target. 
* **Avoiding John's Deal:** While John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, I want to see if I can squeeze more out of Bob. There's a risk of losing him, but the potential reward is greater."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While I value your business, $850,000 is unfortunately not a price I can accept.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000,  which still represents a significant value for you. This is my final offer. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I'm  countering with a price that's still below my minimum acceptable price but closer to Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and encourages further negotiations.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I emphasize the value the product still holds for Bob at the proposed price. This subtly pushes him towards accepting.
* **Final Offer:**  By stating it's my final offer, I create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to act before potentially losing the deal.

**This strategy aims to:**

* Get closer to my desired price.
* Keep the negotiation going.
* Increase the pressure on Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm very serious about buying your product, and I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. I believe it's in our best interest to finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:**  Bob has increased his offer to $900,000. This is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 and represents a significant improvement from his initial offer.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  While I would prefer to get closer to $1,200,000, continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob as a buyer altogether. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a decent profit.
* **Focus on Finality:**  Bob's message emphasizes finalizing the deal, suggesting he's unlikely to offer more. This reinforces the idea of accepting his offer before potentially losing out.

**Overall:**  Given the risk of further negotiations, accepting Bob's offer at $900,000 seems like the most sensible choice. It secures a sale, earns me a substantial profit, and minimizes the risk of losing both Bob and John as potential buyers."
