"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, $900000 is significantly below my minimum price.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value. Let's try to find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $1050000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay up to $950000 for the product. Can you meet me at that price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950000 is still too far below my minimum price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1000000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, considering the value of the product. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to move on to another buyer. ",1000000.0,Alice,5,
