Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:** $12,000 is a significant amount less than Bob's perceived value, giving him room to feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Is above your minimum:** It's above your minimum of $8,000, so you're already making a profit. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
