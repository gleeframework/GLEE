# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is highly valued by its users. Given its quality and features, it's worth $150 to me. Considering its value to you, I'm offering it at $120. This is a great opportunity to acquire a high-quality item at a reasonable price. Please let me know if you're interested.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I can get the same product from John for $100, which is a better deal than Alice's offer of $120.
