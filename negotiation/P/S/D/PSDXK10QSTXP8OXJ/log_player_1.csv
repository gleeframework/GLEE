Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product for a limited time. I think you'll find it's a steal at $130."",
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than both my minimum ($100) and Bob's perceived value ($100). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a higher profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer helps me gauge Bob's interest level. If he accepts immediately, I've secured a great deal. If he negotiates, I know he's interested but wants a better price.  
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm aware I have John as a backup buyer at $100. This knowledge gives me leverage in the negotiation with Bob. I'm not desperate to sell below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I'm willing to pay up to $100 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I know he values the product at $100, so there's a chance I can still negotiate a slightly higher price. I'll try to meet him halfway in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible price. How about we meet in the middle at $115? That's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate by significantly lowering my initial price. 
* **Middle Ground:**  $115 is a compromise that still allows me to make a profit above my minimum while hopefully being enticing enough for Bob to accept. 
* **Time Value:** I'm conscious that continued negotiation takes time. I want to strike a balance between maximizing profit and closing the deal promptly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with a price of $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is holding firm at his maximum perceived value of $100.  It's unlikely he'll budge higher. Accepting his offer ensures I make a profit and avoids the risk of losing both Bob and John as potential buyers."
