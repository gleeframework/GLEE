"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a steal! I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I can see you're a serious buyer. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,000 and $9,500. Let's try $9,000. It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we split the difference again and settle at $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're a persistent buyer, Bob! I appreciate that. However, I'm not willing to go all the way to $8,500. Let's try $9,250. It's a compromise, but I need to stay within my target profit range.",9250.0,Alice,5,

"I think we're getting close, Bob! I can see you're serious about this product, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not ready to give up on the extra $250 yet. Let's try $9,200. It's a small concession, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $9,500.",9200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the effort you're putting into this negotiation, but I'm afraid we're at an impasse. My absolute limit is $9,000. If you're willing to accept that, we can close the deal right now. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",9000.0,Bob,8,
