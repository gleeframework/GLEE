"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While $900,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $1,050,000? This would still be a great value for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually agreeable price. Let's keep the conversation going!",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $1,050,000 is closer, but still a bit outside my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? That's a fair compromise.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  $975,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm open to $1,025,000. This would be a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that works for both of us. What do you say?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
