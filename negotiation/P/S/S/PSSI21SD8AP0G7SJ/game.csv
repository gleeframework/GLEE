"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, and I'm offering a counteroffer of $1200000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
