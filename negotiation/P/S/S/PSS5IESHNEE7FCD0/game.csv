"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your starting price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 undervalues the product significantly. Let's find a middle ground - how about $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $1,350,000 is still a bit steep for me. Could we agree on $1,125,000? I feel that's a fair compromise.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go as low as $1,125,000.  How about we settle at $1,250,000?  This feels like a fair deal for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
