"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $650,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you.",650000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $650,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to offer $550,000 for the product.  This is a significant discount from your initial offer, and I believe it reflects the product's value to me.  Let me know what you think.",550000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $550,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $600,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $600,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $575,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this point.  Let's close the deal!",575000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $575,000 is a good price for you, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'll counteroffer at $620,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",620000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm still committed to getting this deal done, but $620,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to offer $590,000.  This is a significant compromise from my last offer and reflects the value I place on the product.  Let's find a way to bridge the gap.",590000.0,Bob,6,
