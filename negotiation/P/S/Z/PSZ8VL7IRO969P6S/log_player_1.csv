"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $9,500. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and still allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum, I'm confident that I can get a better price. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm offering $9,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still significantly higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping that this will be a more attractive price for him, and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation.  It's clear that Bob is unwilling to budge much further.  To avoid further negotiation and ensure I get a guaranteed sale, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $8,000."
