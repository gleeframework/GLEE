"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm starting with an offer of $20000.  Let me know what you think!",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $20000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $12000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! $12000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $18000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $18000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14000. If we can agree on that, I'll take it off your hands.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $14000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $16000? I think it's a fair price for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still not quite there at $16000. How about we meet in the middle at $15500? I'm confident this would be a fair deal for both of us.",15500.0,Bob,6,
