Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm confident it would be valuable to you.  I'm asking for $19,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 19000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, I can start with a significantly higher offer to test Bob's willingness to pay.  
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The $19,000 price provides room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. This gives me the flexibility to potentially meet somewhere in the middle while still exceeding my minimum price.
* **Confident Language:** Using phrases like ""significant amount"" and ""valuable to you"" emphasizes the product's worth, potentially influencing Bob's perception of its value.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy.  Depending on your risk tolerance and understanding of the market, you might choose a more conservative starting price."
