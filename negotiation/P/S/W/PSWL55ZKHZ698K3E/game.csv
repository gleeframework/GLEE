"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is unique, that price is a little high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I can see you're serious about the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to make another concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1,080,000. I'm getting close to my minimum, but I believe it's still a fair price for this exceptional product.",1080000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I can see you're trying to get as close as possible to your target price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,095,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for this exceptional product.",1095000.0,Alice,7,
