"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the deal, but I'm hoping to keep the price below $1,300,000. Could we possibly work something out? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'll try to negotiate a bit more before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,250,000 is just too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?  I think this price still makes it a great investment for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
