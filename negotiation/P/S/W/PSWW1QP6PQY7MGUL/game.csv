"Thanks for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the deal, but I'm hoping to keep the price below $1,300,000. Could we possibly work something out?",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,250,000 is just too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?  I think this price still makes it a great investment for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
