Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You want to get at least $10,000, so $12,000 is a good starting point.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $15,000, so he has room to negotiate and still get a good deal.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** This gives you space to bargain without immediately going to John's offer of $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $10,500? That's still a good deal for you, and it's within my budget. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is too low. While it's still above your minimum of $10,000, it's closer to John's offer and doesn't leave much room for negotiation. By rejecting, you can make a counteroffer and try to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11,250? It's a fair price, and it allows for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $10,750.  This is a fair price that's closer to my budget, and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $10,750 is only $250 away from your minimum price of $10,500.  At this point, further negotiation may not be worth the effort, especially since John is only offering $10,000. Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale at a price that is close to your minimum, and you can move on to other business opportunities."
