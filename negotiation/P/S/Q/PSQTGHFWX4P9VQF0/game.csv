"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,400,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for it, reflecting its worth to me and leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement. ",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,350,000, which still leaves a significant margin for both of us. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
