"I'm very interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to consider $800000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make an offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $1100000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1100000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to consider $900000 for the product. Can you think about meeting me at this price?",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I can see you're serious about the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I still need to make a profit, so I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $1050000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $1050000. I'm willing to go up to $950000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",950000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm not willing to go any lower, Bob. I've already compromised significantly, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $1000000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're still interested, I'm willing to make a deal at this price. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
