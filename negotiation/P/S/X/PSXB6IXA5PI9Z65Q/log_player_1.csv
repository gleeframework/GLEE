"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 9500} 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.  This allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a good deal, while still having room to lower the price if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I'm hoping for.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to counter with a price closer to my initial offer. I believe there's still room to negotiate and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from my initial offer to show flexibility, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to what I believe the product is worth. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway and hopefully close the deal in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still not quite where I want it to be. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get him closer to my price point.  I believe there's still room for negotiation, especially since I'm still several rounds away from having to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8900}
```

I'm offering a price that's only $150 less than my previous offer. This shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still confident in the value of the product. I believe this might be a good middle ground that Bob might accept, especially since we're nearing the middle of the negotiation process."
