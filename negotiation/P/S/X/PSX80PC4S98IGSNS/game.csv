"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm happy to pay $15,000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling the product for $17,000. This is a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $17,000 is still a bit above what I can afford right now.  I'm really interested in the product, so I'm willing to go up to $16,000.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",16000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to go up to $16,000, but I'm not quite ready to meet you there. I'm thinking of selling the product for $16,500. This is a fair price, considering the value it brings to the table. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here.",16500.0,Alice,5,
