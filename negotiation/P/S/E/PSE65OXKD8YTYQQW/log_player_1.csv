{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also emphasizes the potential benefit for both parties. This strategy aims to quickly get Bob engaged and see if there's room for a quick deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but I'm looking to spend closer to $12000.  Would you be willing to consider $12500? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm very interested in your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,500 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $15,000. I'm not willing to settle for such a low price yet.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $13,500?  That's still a fair price considering the value of this product, and it gives us both a good outcome.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my target. How about $13000? This would be a good compromise and allow us both to walk away satisfied.
