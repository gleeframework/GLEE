"Alice, I appreciate the offer but I'm looking to spend closer to $12000.  Would you be willing to consider $12500? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm very interested in your product.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $13500?  That's still a fair price considering the value of this product, and it gives us both a good outcome.  Let me know what you think.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my target. How about $13000? This would be a good compromise and allow us both to walk away satisfied.",13000.0,Bob,4,
