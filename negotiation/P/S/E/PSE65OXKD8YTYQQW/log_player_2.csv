"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $14000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is better than $15,000, you can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering.  You have a safety net with John's offer of $12,000, so there's no risk in trying to negotiate further with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but I'm looking to spend closer to $12,000.  Would you be willing to consider $12,500? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm very interested in your product."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $13500?  That's still a fair price considering the value of this product, and it gives us both a good outcome.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but you can likely get a better deal.  You know you can get it for $12,000 from John, so you're not under pressure to accept.  Continue negotiating and see if you can push Alice down further."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my target. How about $13,000? This would be a good compromise and allow us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 13000}
