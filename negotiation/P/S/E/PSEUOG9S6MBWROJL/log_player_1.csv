Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $18,000. I know it's valuable to you and believe this is a fair price reflecting its worth."", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal.
* **Anchoring:** By offering a price of $18,000, you are setting a high anchor. While Bob knows it's worth $12,000 to him, your initial offer can influence his perception of the product's value. 
* **Backup Option:** You have John as a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, so there's limited risk in starting high. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is particularly price-sensitive or dislikes haggling, a slightly lower initial offer might be more effective.
* **Market Conditions:**  If the product is in high demand and you think other buyers might be willing to pay more than $12,000, you could justify an even higher initial offer."
