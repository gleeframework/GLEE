,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $87.50?",87.5,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $87.50 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $90. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $87.50 and $90, which would be $88.75. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $88.75?",88.75,Bob,4,
