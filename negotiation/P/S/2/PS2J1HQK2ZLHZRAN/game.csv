"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $18000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14000. This is a great compromise that still benefits both of us.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $10000. It's a fair price considering I'm willing to buy immediately. Let's close this deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'll sell the product to you for $12500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $12500 is still a bit outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $11000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to both walk away with a good deal. ",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go up to $11000, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'll meet you halfway between $12500 and $11000. I'll sell the product to you for $12000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair deal.",12000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $11000.  I'm ready to buy right now, and this price is fair for both of us. Let's make this deal happen.",11000.0,Bob,8,

"I understand that you're still looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'll make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $11800.
