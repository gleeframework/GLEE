"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable product. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who can make a substantial offer. My initial offer is $15,000 for the product."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way beyond my budget. This product would be valuable to me at a lower price point. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $10,000?"", ""product_price"": 10000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $10,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Could you do $7,500? I think that would be a fair compromise.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
