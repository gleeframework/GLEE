"I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable product. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who can make a substantial offer. My initial offer is $15,000 for the product.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way beyond my budget. This product would be valuable to me at a lower price point. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $10,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Could you do $7,500? I think that would be a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you at $7,500, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $9,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm starting to think about other interested buyers, and I don't want to miss out on a better opportunity.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have other potential buyers, but $9,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we split the difference and settle at $8,500? That's my final offer.",8500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've given you a lot of concessions, Bob. $8,500 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm starting to think that I should consider other options. However, I'm willing to make one last attempt to meet you in the middle. I can do $9,250, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other buyers.",9250.0,Alice,7,
