"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is way too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $600,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $600,000 is far too low, and I'm confident I can get a better deal.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 simply isn't enough. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial price.  Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,000,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my desired price, $750,000 is still significantly below what I need to earn.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to drop to $900,000.  This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 900000}
