Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 149}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to $150 as possible since John is my backup buyer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $149 allows for a slight price drop if Bob tries to negotiate, while still staying above my minimum. 
* **Create Urgency:** By calling it a ""special price"" I imply this offer won't last forever, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly."
