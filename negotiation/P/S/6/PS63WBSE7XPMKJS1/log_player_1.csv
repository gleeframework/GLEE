"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start high, but within reason:**  Knowing the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, starting near that value leaves room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit. 
* **Appear confident and justify the price:** Framing the offer as a ""fair"" price based on ""value and potential""  can make Bob more receptive.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  The message explicitly invites Bob's thoughts, indicating a willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $950,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good offer, we're still in the early stages of negotiation. Bob clearly sees value in the product and is willing to pay a premium over our minimum. Rejecting his offer opens the door for a counteroffer that could net us even more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to sell, I believe the product's true value warrants a price closer to my initial offer. Would you consider $930,000?"", 
""product_price"": 930000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concede slightly but hold firm:** Coming down $20,000 shows flexibility but maintains a strong position. 
* **Reiterate the product's value:**  Gently reminding Bob of the value reinforces the justification for a higher price.
* **Open-ended question:**  ""Would you consider..."" encourages a response and keeps the negotiation moving."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, at $915,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently meeting in the middle, indicating he's willing to negotiate. We're getting close, but another rejection might push him closer to our desired price range.  We still have room to negotiate before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's make this happen. How about $922,500? That's my final offer."", 
""product_price"": 922500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concede slightly, but set a firm boundary:** Meeting Bob exactly in the middle shows a willingness to compromise but makes it clear this is the best offer. 
* **Convey a sense of urgency:**  Phrases like ""Let's make this happen"" and ""final offer"" encourage Bob to make a decision.
* **The offer is still highly profitable:** $922,500 is significantly above our minimum and represents a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $920,000, but no higher. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to our desired price:** $920,000 is only $2,500 less than our last offer, a relatively small difference at this price point. 
* **Bob is signaling his limit:**  His language (""no higher"") suggests this is as high as he'll go.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing the negotiation carries the risk of Bob walking away, leaving us to settle for John's lower offer. Accepting now secures a very strong profit."
