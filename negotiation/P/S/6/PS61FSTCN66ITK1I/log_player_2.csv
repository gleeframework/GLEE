"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love.  I'm asking for $10,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can likely get a better price than $10,000 since Alice is willing to sell for $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $10,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I understand it's a bit high, but $9,000 doesn't quite cover my costs. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to your target price.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a good chance Alice won't budge much lower.  At $9,500 you're still saving $2,500 compared to buying from John, so accepting the offer is a good move."
