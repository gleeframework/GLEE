{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product.  It's a valuable asset, and I believe it has the potential to be a real game-changer for you. My asking price is $1,000,000. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget.  Would you consider $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm prepared to go down to $950,000.  Let's keep this negotiation moving towards a win-win scenario."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is a good compromise. While I'd prefer more, it's a decent amount and avoids the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price or having to sell to John for $800,000.  It's time to close the deal."
