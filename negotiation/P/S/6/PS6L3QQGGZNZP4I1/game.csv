"I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500 to make this deal work.  It's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $8,500 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $7,500, but I'd really like to get it for $7,000 if possible.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,000 is simply not enough. I'm willing to drop the price to $8,250 to make this work. It's a significant compromise on my part, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.  Let's make this deal happen.",8250.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $7,500, but I'd really like to get it for $7,000. Can you consider going down to $7,500 or even $7,250?",7250.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your situation, but I'm still firm on $8,000.  It's a fair price, and I'm confident this is a good investment for you.  If you're unable to meet this price, I'll have to move forward with another buyer.  It's your call.",8000.0,Alice,7,
