Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price is a little steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, however, the value of this product is truly significant and $1,000,000 falls quite a bit short of that.  I could be persuaded to let it go for $1,600,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you think?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,600,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about $1,200,000? That's a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Bob has now met my minimum acceptable price. There's no benefit to risking further negotiation or taking John's offer."
