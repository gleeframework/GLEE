"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially offering it for $1,800,000. I believe this price accurately reflects its worth. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price is a little steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, however, the value of this product is truly significant and $1,000,000 falls quite a bit short of that.  I could be persuaded to let it go for $1,600,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,600,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about $1,200,000? That's a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
