Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $95. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer gives me a good starting point for negotiation while still being a reasonable price for Bob, as it's below his perceived value of $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum, I'd like to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm happy to negotiate, $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  This gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the counteroffer. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $87.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would have liked to get a bit closer to my initial price, Bob's counteroffer of $87.5 is a good compromise. It's higher than what John is offering, and it's closer to my desired price than my last counteroffer.  I'll accept and sell the product to Bob."
