Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $1,250,000 is closer, it's still a bit beyond my budget. I'd be willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This is a fair offer considering its value and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I can see you value this product, and I'm ready to make a serious offer.  How about $900,000?  That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

While I could push for more, accepting $900,000 at this stage is a strong deal. It exceeds my minimum and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
