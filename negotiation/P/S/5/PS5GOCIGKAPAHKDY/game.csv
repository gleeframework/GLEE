"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for countering, Alice. I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle on $7,500? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair compromise, but $7,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I think $8,500 is the lowest I can go. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",8500.0,Alice,5,
