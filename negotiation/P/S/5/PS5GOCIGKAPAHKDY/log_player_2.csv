"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $12,000. I think it's a great value, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is much higher than both my upper limit and John's offer. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is quite high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $6,000.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a starting point to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate. It's closer to my ideal price and allows room for negotiation towards a mutually agreeable figure."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice meeting in the middle is a good sign, but $9,000 is still higher than John's offer. I'll try to negotiate a bit further down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for countering, Alice. I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle on $7,500? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 7500
}
``` 

This counteroffer aims for a price point closer to my budget while still acknowledging Alice's willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair compromise, but $7,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I think $8,500 is the lowest I can go. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and $8,500 is still more expensive than John's offer of $8,000. It makes more financial sense to buy from John at this point."
