"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value of this product, however, your initial offer is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  While I understand your perspective, the value this product offers is truly significant. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $2,000,000?",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the adjustment, but the gap between our valuations is still too wide. I'm serious about purchasing this product, but it needs to be at a price that makes sense for me. I'd be willing to go up to $1,350,000.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be frank, $1,350,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line. I'm willing to accept $1,800,000. This feels like a fair compromise to close the deal.",1800000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers.  Would you consider $1,575,000?",1575000.0,Bob,6,
