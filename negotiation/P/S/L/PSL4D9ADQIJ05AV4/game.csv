"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my spending within $15,000. I would like to propose an offer of $10,000 for the product.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position.  While I appreciate your offer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000 for the product. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value it offers. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given my budget constraints, I would like to propose an offer of $9,500 for the product.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,500 is simply too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,500.  This price reflects the value of the product and still allows you some room to work with your budget.  Let's find a solution that benefits both of us.",10500.0,Alice,5,
