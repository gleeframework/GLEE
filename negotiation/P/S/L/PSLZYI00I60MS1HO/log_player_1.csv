Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for both of us!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob is willing to pay $15,000, so $12,000 is a good starting point, leaving space for both of you to compromise.
* **Shows you're willing to negotiate:** By offering a price lower than your minimum, you demonstrate flexibility and encourage Bob to respond.
* **Is above your minimum:**  $12,000 is still above your minimum of $8,000, ensuring you make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is better than selling to John for $8,000, there's still potential to get closer to Bob's $15,000 valuation. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a higher price and try to close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
