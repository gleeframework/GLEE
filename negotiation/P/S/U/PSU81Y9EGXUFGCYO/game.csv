"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. It's a game-changer, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to start at $1200000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1200000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement, but I think this product has a lot of potential for me. What do you say?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not sure I'm comfortable going that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1050000. I'd like to propose a compromise at $950000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm counteroffering at $980000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. Let me know if this works for you.",980000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $980000 is the right price. I'd like to make one more counteroffer. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $990000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to think about walking away and buying from John, though, so let's see if we can come to an agreement.",990000.0,Bob,6,
