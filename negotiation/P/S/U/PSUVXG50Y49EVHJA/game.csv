"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for a discussion. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm eager to find a price that works for both of us, $1,800,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $2,100,000? This reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a significant return on your investment.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make a revised offer of $1,900,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Can we meet somewhere in the middle again?",1900000.0,Bob,4,
