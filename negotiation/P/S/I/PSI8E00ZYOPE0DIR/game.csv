"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it allows you to stay within your budget. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm afraid $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to go up to $9,800, but that's as high as I can go. I really want to make this deal work, but I need to stay within my budget.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility.  While I'm willing to compromise, $9,800 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $10,150?  It's a fair price that gets us closer to a deal and allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?",10150.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're close, but I really need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, but that's my absolute maximum. I'm hoping we can meet on this price, but if not, I'll have to consider buying from John.",10000.0,Bob,6,
