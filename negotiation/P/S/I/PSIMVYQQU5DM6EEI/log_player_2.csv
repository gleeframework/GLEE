"Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  $13,000 is still too high for you. You can get the same product from John for $8,000, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer. You should try to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

You are offering $9,000 for the product. This is significantly lower than Alice's offer of $13,000, but still higher than John's price of $8,000. This gives you some room to negotiate while still staying within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You should reject Alice's offer. Although it's lower than her previous offer, it's still higher than John's price. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice to see if you can get a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

You're offering $10,000 for the product. This is a compromise between your previous offer of $9,000 and Alice's current offer of $11,000.  It's still within your budget, and hopefully, Alice will see it as a reasonable offer."
