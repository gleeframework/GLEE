"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9,500? That's still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $9,500 is closer,  could you do $8,750?  I think that's a fair price.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to continue working with you.  However, $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $9,250. That's a significant compromise, and I hope we can find a solution that works for both of us.",9250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and settle at $9,000?  That seems like a fair compromise to me.",9000.0,Bob,6,
