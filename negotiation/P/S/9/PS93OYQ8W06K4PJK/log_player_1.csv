Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a good starting point, as it leaves some room for negotiation while still giving me a profit of $30.  If Bob rejects, I'll see what his counteroffer is and make a decision based on his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $100 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $105.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, and still gives me a good profit.  I think it's likely Bob will accept this offer, as it's closer to his desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I would have preferred to get $105, $102 is still a good price and more than what John would have paid. There's no guarantee that Bob will make a higher offer in the next round, and I don't want to risk losing the sale completely."
