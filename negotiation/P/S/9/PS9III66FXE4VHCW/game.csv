"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a highly sought-after item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $700,000. I appreciate your interest in the product. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering $850,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. To be honest, I'm trying to keep my budget under $800,000 for this.  Would you be willing to accept $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $825,000. This is a compromise that I'm willing to make to keep the negotiation going. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you've been very reasonable, but I need to stick closer to my budget. My final offer is $780,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",780000.0,Bob,6,
