"I have a great opportunity for you, Bob. I'm willing to sell this valuable product to you for $9,000. It's a fair price considering its worth to you is $10,000.",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $7,000 for the product.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, $7,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $8,500. It's a fair compromise considering its value to you is $10,000.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $7,750? I'm eager to make this purchase and believe this is a fair offer.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $7,750 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. I'm now offering the product to you for $8,250. Let's meet in the middle again.",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $8,000. That's a fair price, and I'm sure we can both agree on it.",8000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet at $8,000 yet. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $8,100. Let's see if we can get even closer to a deal.",8100.0,Alice,7,
