"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. I think you'll find it's a steal at this price, considering its worth to me is no less than $1200000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I'm not interested in paying $1,500,000 for the product, as it's above my budget of $1,000,000. I'll reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John for $1,000,000.
