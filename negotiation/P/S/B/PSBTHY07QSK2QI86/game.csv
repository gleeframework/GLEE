"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own a truly exceptional item. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm willing to start the negotiation with an offer of $800000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and your potential interest in it.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product,  $800000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable starting at. I'm willing to offer $600000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $600000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $700000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and your potential interest in it. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $700000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm ready to offer $650000.  This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good starting point for us to reach an agreement.",650000.0,Bob,4,
