"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I think you'll find it's well worth the extra $2,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $14,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that my product is worth more than $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the effort I've put into it. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $11,250? I think that's a fair compromise.",11250.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,250 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more offer to meet you halfway. I'll offer the product to you for $12,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",12250.0,Alice,5,
