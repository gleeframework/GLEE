Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $1,400,000 is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so there's room for negotiation. This is a good strategy as it allows for potential compromise without immediately pushing Bob away.

I will then monitor Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,300,000 is still above my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I will counter with a higher offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer, but still higher than my minimum.  I believe this price is fair and gives us both a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,290,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,290,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I was hoping for a slightly higher price, $1,290,000 is still very close to my desired range. It's a good deal, and it avoids the risk of losing the sale entirely by continuing to negotiate."
