Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a product I believe would be very valuable to you.  I'm offering it to you for $1,600,000. It's a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll see a strong return.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product at $1,600,000. This is a price that's higher than what the product is worth to Bob ($800,000) but still lower than my fallback price with John ($1,500,000).
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the potential value to Bob, making the price seem more justifiable. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to maximize profit by:

* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The price is higher than Bob's value, but there's room for negotiation. 
* **Securing a Higher Price than John:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, I'm still guaranteed a sale to John at a higher price than what Bob is willing to pay. 

By offering a higher price than Bob's value but still lower than John's, I am taking a calculated risk. This increases the chance of Bob accepting the offer, while still guaranteeing a substantial profit even if he doesn't."
