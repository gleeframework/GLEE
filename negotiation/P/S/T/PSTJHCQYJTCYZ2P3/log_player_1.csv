Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While the product is very interesting, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This price is still a good deal for you as it's closer to your desired price than what I can get from another seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $900,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm confident that this product is valuable, but I'm only able to offer $875,000 at this time.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.
