Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I'd like to get for the product. I want to see if I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $9,250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's still below my ideal price, it's getting closer to what I'm willing to accept. I'm also concerned about running out of rounds and being forced to sell to John at a lower price than I could potentially get from Bob."
