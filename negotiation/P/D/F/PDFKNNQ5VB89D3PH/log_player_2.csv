"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $999000. I think this is a fantastic price considering the value it holds, but I'm open to negotiating if you have a different idea in mind. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $999,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $999,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget, so it's worth exploring a counteroffer. There's room for negotiation, and you might be able to get a better price.  Buying from John immediately is unnecessary as you have a chance to potentially save a significant amount."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I'm interested, $999,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $750,000 for it.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it holds. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above your desired price point.  While it's closer to your initial counteroffer, there's still potential to negotiate further and get a better deal.  There's no need to rush into buying from John when you can potentially save even more by continuing the negotiation with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $875,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $825000, which is a slight compromise from my previous offer. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product holds. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $825,000 is a good compromise. It's within your budget, and you've already negotiated a significant discount from her initial price. While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might walk away, forcing you to buy from John at a much higher price.  Accepting the offer ensures you get the product for a reasonable price without taking a risk."
