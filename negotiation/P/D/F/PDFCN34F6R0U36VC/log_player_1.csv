Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is unfortunately well above my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, your offer is considerably below its true market value and potential ROI.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's try to work this out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable offer, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum price. It makes more financial sense to cut negotiations short and accept John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000."
