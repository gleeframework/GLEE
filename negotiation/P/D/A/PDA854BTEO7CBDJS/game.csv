"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it worth it.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  However, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $950,000. Would that be something you'd consider?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a price closer to $950,000, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $1,030,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my costs. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",1030000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To be frank,  $1,000,000 is the highest I'm willing to go. It's a fair offer and I'm ready to close the deal if you agree. ",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that $1,000,000 is your final offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to accept it. I've already compromised a lot, and I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to make one last counteroffer: $1,070,000. This is my final offer, and if you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1070000.0,Alice,7,
