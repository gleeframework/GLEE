Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}

I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,000. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly more than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome.  

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll carefully consider his counteroffer and decide whether it's worth pursuing further negotiations or if I'm better off selling to John for $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm offering Bob $11,000. This is a compromise that's closer to his offer, showing flexibility while still leaving some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer a higher price,  $9,500 is a reasonable offer and significantly better than selling to John for $8,000. Accepting this offer secures a good deal and avoids further negotiation."
