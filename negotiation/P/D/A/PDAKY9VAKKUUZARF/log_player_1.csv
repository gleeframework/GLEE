Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're asking for more than your minimum of $120.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $150, so there's space to negotiate a price that benefits both of you. 
* **It's a clear and concise message:**  This ensures Bob understands your offer and can easily respond. 

Remember, the key is to find a price that maximizes your profit while also keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I was hoping to find a price closer to $120. Would you be willing to consider $130 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Here's why accepting Bob's offer is the best choice:

* **Profit:** While $130 is less than your initial offer of $140, it's still above your minimum of $120. This means you're still making a profit.
* **Minimizes risk:**  Continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob as a buyer altogether. By accepting his offer, you secure a sale.
* **Efficiency:**  It's a quick and efficient way to close the deal.  

While you could try to negotiate further, the potential gains are small compared to the risk of losing the sale."
