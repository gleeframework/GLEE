Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price considering its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible, but she also wants to make sure Bob doesn't reject the offer.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $8,000, so Alice needs to offer a price significantly lower than her own valuation while still being appealing to Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While this offer is a starting point, Alice leaves some room for negotiation in case Bob tries to counter-offer.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing a sale with Bob."
