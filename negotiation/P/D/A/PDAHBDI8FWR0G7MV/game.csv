"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing further.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,300,000 is significantly outside my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can't justify paying that much. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget and the product's potential.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and providing your perspective. While I understand your budget constraints, $850,000 significantly undervalues the product's unique capabilities. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a substantial reduction and reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,150,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which reflects a reasonable compromise. This is a significant offer for me, and I believe it's fair considering the product's value and my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  I'm willing to consider a price of $1,050,000. This is a significant concession on my end and demonstrates my commitment to making this deal work. I believe this offer represents a fair compromise for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down.  However, $1,050,000 is still beyond what I can comfortably pay. To make this deal work, I'm offering $975,000.  This is a significant offer for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential of the product and the progress we've made in our negotiations.",975000.0,Bob,6,
