{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $11,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while still maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested, but I could only go as high as $8,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, but he's shown interest. I'll counter-offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  That's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice.  Let's try to make this work. Would you consider $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm not in a rush to sell and want to see if I can push him a little further.  I'll make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $8,500 still falls short of what I need. Let's try $9,000 again.  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 
I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9,000.  I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us, and I want to see if Bob is willing to budge."
