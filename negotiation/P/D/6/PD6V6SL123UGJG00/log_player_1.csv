Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, but I'm open to discussing it further if you have any thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to lower the price. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the product's value, you anchor Bob's perception to a higher price point. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** You signal that you're willing to negotiate, which can encourage Bob to engage in the conversation even if he finds the initial price too high.
* **Backup Plan:**  Remember, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, so you have leverage in this negotiation."
