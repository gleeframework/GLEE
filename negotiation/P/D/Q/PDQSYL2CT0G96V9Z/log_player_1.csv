{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a slightly higher price than the minimum I'm willing to accept, leaving room for negotiation if needed. I'm also being friendly and positive to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't settle for a price that's too far below the product's worth. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, however. How about we settle on $1,175,000? This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1175000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,175,000 is still a bit above my budget. How about we try $1,150,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm getting closer to my lower limit, but I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,200,000 yet. I'll make a final counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."

{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're determined to get a good deal, and I respect that. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one final concession. How about $1,190,000? This is the absolute lowest I can go, considering the value of the product. It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1190000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $1,190,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,150,000 and $1,190,000. How about we try $1,170,000? I think that's a fair compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,170,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,170,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'm tempted to continue negotiating with Bob, his offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. I've already made significant concessions, and I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed $1,200,000 by continuing to negotiate.  It's time to move on and secure the sale with John."
