"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You are looking to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is within your budget, it's still higher than the product's value to Alice. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer. It's likely that Alice will be willing to negotiate further, as she values the product at $10,000. This strategy aims to quickly establish a lower price point and put pressure on Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is a good deal for you. You're still getting the product for significantly less than what you'd pay from John, and it's likely that further negotiation will only lead to more rounds and the risk of Alice getting impatient or you running out of rounds. It's a smart decision to accept the offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
