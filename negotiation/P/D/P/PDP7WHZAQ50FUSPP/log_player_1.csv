Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

This offer is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a high price, but I'm also factoring in that Bob values the product at $1,500,000.  This gives him room to negotiate while still leaving me with a significant profit.  I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $1,000,000, so this offer is a good starting point for a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take $1,200,000, I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial offer. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, giving Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a significant profit."

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,350,000. This is a compromise, but it still leaves me with a considerable profit and gives Bob a better deal than his initial offer. I'm confident that we can reach an agreement within this range."
