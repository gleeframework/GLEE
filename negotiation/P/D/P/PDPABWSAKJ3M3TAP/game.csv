"I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less than $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. Can you consider this price?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I understand you feel the product is worth less than my initial offer, but considering its value, I can come down to $1,050,000. Let's meet in the middle. This is a good price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize the deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I still think the product is worth less than $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'll offer $1,025,000 for the product. Can you consider this price?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and $1,025,000 is a much better offer than our previous rounds. However, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,050,000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $1,037,500. Let's close this deal.",1037500.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting very close. I understand your perspective, but I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price. Let's meet in the middle once more.  I'll offer the product for $1,033,750. This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures we can finally conclude this deal.",1033750.0,Alice,7,
