"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $110.  I think you'll find it's a great deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $110 is still above your maximum budget of $80. 
* You know you can get the product from John for $80.
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of her making a lower counter-offer, or you can proceed to buy from John at your desired price."
