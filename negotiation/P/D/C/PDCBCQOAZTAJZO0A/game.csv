"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, which is still a great deal for you given the value you place on this product. Let's find common ground!",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable paying $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,125,000 for the product. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
