"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $13,000? This price is still fair considering the value of the product, and allows both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know what you think!",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13,000, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $12,500? That's the lowest I can go, and I'm confident it's still a fair price for the product.",12500.0,Bob,4,
