This is a good time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Price is right:** $780,000 is a significant savings from her initial offer and below your maximum budget.
* **Final offer:** Alice has stated this is her final offer, signaling she's unlikely to go lower. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate risks her withdrawing the offer altogether, leaving you to pay John's higher price."
