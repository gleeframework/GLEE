Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 
Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with an offer just below your minimum ($150) aims to get the highest price Bob might be willing to pay. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial offer is $149, there's a slight chance Bob might try to negotiate down a few dollars, still landing you above your guaranteed sale to John.
* **Time Value:**  Selling to Bob quickly, even at a slightly lower price, might be preferable to waiting for the guaranteed sale to John. 
 
It's important to note that this assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or willingness to pay more than $120."
