{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $120 is significantly more than your minimum of $80, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  $120 is lower than what Bob values the product at ($150), making the offer potentially attractive to him.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for Bob to make a counteroffer, allowing you to continue the negotiation. 

By starting with this offer, you can gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a good price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is more than your minimum of $80, you can likely do better. By rejecting Bob's offer, you can send a counteroffer and attempt to negotiate a higher price, potentially closer to your initial offer of $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $90 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $105, which would be $97.50. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to $105, accepting Bob's offer for $97.50 is a good compromise. It's still significantly higher than selling to John for $80, and it seems like Bob is firm on his price."
