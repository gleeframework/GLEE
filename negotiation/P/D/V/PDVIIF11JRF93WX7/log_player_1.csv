"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for you that I think you'll really love! I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point as it's a reasonable offer for Bob, and it gives me room to negotiate if he counters. I'm also being friendly and positive in my message to build a good rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to find a price closer to $80 for the product. Would you be willing to consider a price around that range? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $80 is my minimum, I'm not willing to sell at that price just yet. I believe I can get closer to my target of $100.  I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $80 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $90? That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my needs, Alice. I appreciate the offer, but I still believe that $80 would be a fair price for the product. Could you possibly meet me halfway at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would have preferred $90, $85 is still a good deal for me.  It's above my minimum and getting closer to my target. Continuing to negotiate may result in a lower offer from Bob or a counter-offer I'm not willing to accept, risking selling to John for $80."
