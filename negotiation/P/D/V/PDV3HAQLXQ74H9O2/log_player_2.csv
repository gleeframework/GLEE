Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $110 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm still willing to sell the product to you, but I need to make a bit more profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $100.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
