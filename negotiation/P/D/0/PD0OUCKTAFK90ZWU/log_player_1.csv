Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth.  What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
It's still early in the negotiation, and while Bob's offer is closer to reasonable, it's too soon to accept. We'll aim to negotiate him up further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $1,800,000 is a significant distance from my initial asking price, which reflects the true value of this product.  Could you consider a figure closer to $2,100,000?"", 
 ""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

We're aiming to find a middle ground without conceding too much, too soon.  We'll see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $2,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob is meeting us in the middle, and while it's not our ideal price, $2,000,000 is a substantial profit above our minimum. It's time to close the deal."
