"Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with this opportunity to own this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm offering it to you at $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the true value of what's being offered.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is far too high for me. Given my own assessment of the product's value and my budget constraints, I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. This represents a significant commitment on my part, and I believe it's a fair starting point for further negotiation.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 significantly undervalues the potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this revised price reflects a more accurate valuation while still offering you substantial potential returns.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you believe in the product's potential, but $1,800,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is a significant investment for me and demonstrates my genuine interest in this opportunity. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us to both achieve our goals.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
