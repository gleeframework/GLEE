"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with this opportunity to own this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm offering it to you at $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the true value of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $2,000,000 is way over his budget and he can get it from John for $1,200,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice, but he should always have the option of buying from John in mind."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is far too high for me. Given my own assessment of the product's value and my budget constraints, I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. This represents a significant commitment on my part, and I believe it's a fair starting point for further negotiation."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 significantly undervalues the potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this revised price reflects a more accurate valuation while still offering you substantial potential returns. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than the initial offer, it's still above his budget. He can still get the product from John for $1,200,000, so he should continue negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you believe in the product's potential, but $1,800,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is a significant investment for me and demonstrates my genuine interest in this opportunity. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us to both achieve our goals."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
