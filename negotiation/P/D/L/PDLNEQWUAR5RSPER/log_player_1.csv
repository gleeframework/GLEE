"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to see if he's willing to budge. I'm also being friendly to create a positive negotiation atmosphere.  I'll keep in mind that I can always sell to John for $150 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $140 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to go up to $125.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum value of $150.  While I'd like to close the deal, I'm not willing to accept a loss. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $125 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $135? It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground by offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum acceptable value. I'm also emphasizing the value proposition for Bob to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $135 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford. How about we split the difference and go with $130? That way, we can both walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $130 is still below my ideal price, but it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable value.  With only 6 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing a deal entirely and having to sell to John for a lower profit.  I'll accept this offer and move on."
