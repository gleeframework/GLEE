,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice, $140 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to go up to $125.  What do you think?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $125 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $135? It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to an agreement.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $135 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford. How about we split the difference and go with $130? That way, we can both walk away happy.",130.0,Bob,4,
