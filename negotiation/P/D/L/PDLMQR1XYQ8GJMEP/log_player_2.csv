"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset that will bring significant returns. I'm willing to start with a price of $1100000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can potentially get the product for less than $1,100,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. Considering the value of the product to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1050000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to me, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting this offer allows you to make another counteroffer and potentially get the product for a price closer to $950,000."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,050,000 is getting closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. Considering the value of the product to you, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll meet you at $1050000, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options. What's your decision?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated this is her final offer.  While you could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will walk away from the deal.  At $1,050,000, you are still saving $150,000 compared to buying from John.  It's a reasonable price considering your desired price and Alice's perceived value of the product."
