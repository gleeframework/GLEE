,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for. Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This price still reflects the value of the product to you, and gives us both a fair deal.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to your valuation.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,250,000 is closer, I'm still not comfortable with that price. Let's meet halfway again. How about $1,325,000? This offer is still within your budget, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a good value for you.",1325000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,280,000. That's a significant move on my end, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise.",1280000.0,Bob,6,
