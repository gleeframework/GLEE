Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go as low as $140, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer it to you for $155. It's my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has drawn a line in the sand and is unlikely to go lower than $155.  At this point, it's more beneficial to buy from John for $150 and avoid further negotiation rounds."
