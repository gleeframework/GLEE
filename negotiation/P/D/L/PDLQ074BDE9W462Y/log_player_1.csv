Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $90. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 90} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $90 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **Higher than John's Offer:**  It's crucial that your offer to Bob is higher than John's $80 offer, ensuring you aim for the best possible deal."
