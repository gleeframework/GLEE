"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to lower my price to $1,600,000. This would still allow me to make a reasonable profit while acknowledging your financial limitations. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000, which is my absolute maximum. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a sale and me to stay within my budget.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
