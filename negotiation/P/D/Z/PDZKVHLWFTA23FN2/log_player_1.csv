Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Fair Offer:** While the price is higher than my floor, it's still within the range of what the product is worth to Bob, making the offer seem fair.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  My message conveys that I'm open to negotiation, indicating flexibility. 

This approach allows me to maximize potential profit while also keeping the negotiation open and friendly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer would mean selling the product at a loss.
* **Potential for Negotiation:** While Bob's offer is low, it's still within the realm of potential negotiation. By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to find a price that's closer to my desired value.
* **Selling to John is an Option:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  This provides a safety net and ensures I won't lose money.

**Next Steps:** I will proceed to the next round by making a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to find a price that is acceptable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to lower my price to $1,600,000. This would still allow me to make a reasonable profit while acknowledging your financial limitations. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm making a counteroffer that is still higher than my minimum but lower than my initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **""Meeting in the Middle"":** Using the phrase ""meet in the middle"" suggests a compromise and a desire to find a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I reiterate that the product is valuable and that this price still allows me to make a profit, subtly encouraging Bob to consider the value proposition.
* **Open to Discussion:**  My message ends with a question, inviting Bob to continue the conversation and explore potential agreements."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000, which is my absolute maximum. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a sale and me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer Meets Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price.  This means I won't lose money on the deal.
* **No Need for Further Negotiation:** There's no need to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with a lower offer.  Bob has reached my minimum, and I don't need to push for more.
* **Time is Money:**  Further negotiation could drag out the process. Accepting Bob's offer allows me to finalize the sale quickly and secure the profit.

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a profitable sale while minimizing the risk of further negotiation and potential delays."
