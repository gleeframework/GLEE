"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget.  If he's seriously interested, he'll likely counteroffer. If he rejects outright, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is closer to my desired value, but I'm not ready to settle yet. I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still aiming for a significant profit. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not desperate to sell for his initial counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a better price. Bob's offer is closer, but I believe I can get closer to my initial target with more negotiation.  We're nearing the halfway point of the rounds, and I'm willing to risk it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm continuing to inch closer to Bob's offers, but keeping the pressure on.  I believe this counteroffer is reasonable, and might be enough to get Bob to close the deal before we run out of rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to what I'd like. We're approaching the end of our negotiation rounds, and I'm not sure I can squeeze out much more.  This is a good deal, and it's better than selling to John for $1,000,000."
