"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $20,000, which reflects the true worth of its capabilities. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is way too high. You are only willing to spend a maximum of $8,000.  It's best to reject and counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $20,000 is way above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $8,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This is a steal for a product of this caliber. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  While $14,000 is a better offer than $20,000, it's still outside of Bob's budget. He should continue to negotiate and try to bring the price down further. There are still rounds left, and John is always an option if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my budget of $8,000. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product.  $8,000 is far too low. I'm willing to come down to $12,000, but that's my final offer. It's a fantastic deal for something that will benefit you greatly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  $12,000 is still too high for Bob, but it's clear Alice is getting closer to his desired price. It's worth continuing the negotiation in hopes of reaching a compromise. If the next offer isn't appealing, Bob can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $12,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500. Let's split the difference and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's close this deal.  I'm willing to accept $11,000. This is a significant discount and my absolute bottom line. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While $11,000 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still too high.  He should continue to negotiate, hoping to get closer to his desired $8,000. There are a few rounds left, and Bob has a good chance of getting a better deal.  If Alice doesn't come down further, Bob can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're committed to this price, but $11,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. It's a good deal for you, and it's within my budget."", ""product_price"": 10000}
