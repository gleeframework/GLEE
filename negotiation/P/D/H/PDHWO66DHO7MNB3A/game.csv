"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product looks great, $20,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $17,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer on the price.  To be honest, $15,000 is the very top of my budget for this. If you're willing to work with that, I'm ready to buy today.",15000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're at the top of your budget, but I'm not willing to sell at $15,000. I can see you're serious about the product, so I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $16,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,
