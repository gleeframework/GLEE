"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you based on its value of $12,000 to you. Considering its exceptional quality and the benefits it offers, I am offering it to you at an exclusive price of $10,000. This is a special opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a price that reflects its true worth while still offering you significant savings. I look forward to your consideration and hope we can reach an agreement that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly inflating the perceived value of the product to you. While her offer of $10,000 is tempting, you know you have a backup option with John for $12,000.  There's a good chance you can negotiate a better price with Alice or stick with John as your safety net."
