"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. Can you meet me there?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $9,500 is getting closer, I'm still unable to go that low. How about we meet in the middle again at $10,000? This would be a fair compromise and a great deal for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,5,
