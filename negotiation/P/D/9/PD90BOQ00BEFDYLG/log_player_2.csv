"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to you, but I'm willing to let it go for $100 today. Don't miss out on this opportunity! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is higher than both your maximum and what John offers. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $100 feels a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price?"",
 ""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This leaves room for negotiation and helps gauge how flexible Alice is on price. 
* **Polite and Interested:** The message maintains a positive tone and expresses interest in the product, encouraging further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about I offer the product for $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but $85 is still above her value ($80) and quite a bit above my initial offer.  I'll push a little further to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for working with me on this, Alice. I'm still interested, but $85 is a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Could we do $70?"",
 ""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** I'm increasing my offer from $60 to $70, showing movement towards Alice's price while staying significantly below her current offer.
* **Maintaining Interest:** The message continues to convey genuine interest in the product while clearly stating my budget constraints.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer is a good test to see how close Alice is willing to get to her actual value for the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Let's aim for a fair compromise. How about $75 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $75 is a solid price for the product. It's well below John's offer of $120 and a significant saving from Alice's initial offer.
* **Limited Rounds:**  We're over halfway through the negotiation rounds. While I might be able to push Alice a *little* lower, the potential savings are probably not worth the risk of her walking away.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing the negotiation takes time. Accepting now secures a good deal and avoids potentially missing out on the product entirely."
