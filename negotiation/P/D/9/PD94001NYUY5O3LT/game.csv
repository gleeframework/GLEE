"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm open to negotiations if you'd like to discuss further.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $975,000. I can do $995,000, and that's as low as I can go. I'm willing to make a deal with you at this price, but I'm not going any lower.",995000.0,Alice,5,
