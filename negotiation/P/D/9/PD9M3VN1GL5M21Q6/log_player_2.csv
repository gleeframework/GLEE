"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting price is closer to my maximum budget than it is to her own valuation. There's room for negotiation.  I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a little high for me right now.  Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's opening offer. This gives me room to negotiate upwards while still aiming for a price well below my $150 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, but $100 is too low for me. Could we meet in the middle at $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is negotiating, but $130 is still closer to my budget than hers. I'll reject and propose a price closer to the middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, Alice. How about $115?"",
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I've increased my offer to signal that I'm willing to pay a fair price. This offer is a compromise closer to the middle ground between our initial positions."
