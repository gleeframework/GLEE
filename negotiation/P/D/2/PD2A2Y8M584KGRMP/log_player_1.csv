"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm going for a slightly lower price than my minimum value, aiming to start negotiations with a reasonable offer that might entice Bob. I'm also including a friendly message to make the negotiation more approachable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum value of $150. I believe I can still get a better price by continuing negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $100 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $120. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120} 
```

I'm aiming for a middle ground between my minimum value and Bob's offer, showing flexibility while still protecting my interests.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $120 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $110. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $110 is closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'd prefer. I'm going to continue negotiating, as I believe I can potentially get a better deal. I have several rounds left and I'm not desperate to sell immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to go down to $115. This is a fair compromise, and it's still a good deal for you considering the product's value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm sticking with my strategy of slowly decreasing the price, aiming to find a compromise that's acceptable to both of us. I'm emphasizing the fairness and value of the deal to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go down to $105. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $105 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'd prefer. I'm still hopeful that we can reach a more favorable price in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm getting a sense we're both determined to find a deal that works for us. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $110. This is my final offer. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm making a final offer, trying to split the difference with Bob's last offer. I'm also adding a sense of urgency to encourage him to accept. With only a few rounds left, I need to find a balance between pushing for a better price and securing a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go down to $100. This is my final offer. If you can meet me at this price, I'll take the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John for $150. With only two rounds left, Bob's offer is still below my minimum value.  I'm not confident that I can get a better price in the remaining rounds, and selling to John guarantees me my minimum value. It's a safer and more reliable option at this point."
