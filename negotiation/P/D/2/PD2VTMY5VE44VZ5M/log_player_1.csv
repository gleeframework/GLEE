Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I believe it's worth a good deal for you. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $100, hoping to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Counter-Offers:**  $110 allows for some wiggle room if Bob wants to counteroffer, while still being higher than his perceived value, giving me leverage. 
* **Politeness:**  A friendly message can help maintain a positive tone during the negotiation. 

I'm confident that I can secure a good price for the product, and if Bob isn't willing to meet my asking price, I can always fall back on selling it to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $80 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100. Accepting it would result in a loss.
* **Potential for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is low, he's expressed interest in the product. This suggests there's room for negotiation, and I can likely secure a better price by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer.
* **Selling to John is a fallback option:** If negotiation with Bob fails, selling to John for $100 is always a viable option. 

I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $80 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $95? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm demonstrating flexibility by coming down from my initial offer, but not going too low. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the value of the product for Bob, emphasizing that $95 is still a good deal for him.
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:** Using a friendly message helps keep the negotiation constructive and avoids creating animosity.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us. I believe this price is still a good deal for me, but it also offers Bob a more reasonable alternative compared to his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I really can't go above $80. Would you be willing to meet me at $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is persistent but not changing:**  Bob has made it clear that he's not willing to budge from his $80 offer.
* **My minimum price is not met:** $80 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100, and further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a better price.
* **John offers a guaranteed sale:**  Selling to John for $100 guarantees a profit and avoids further negotiation with Bob.

It's better to accept John's offer and sell the product at my minimum acceptable price than to risk losing more time and potentially ending up with an even lower price from Bob."
