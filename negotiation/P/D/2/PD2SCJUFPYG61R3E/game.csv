"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $850,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
