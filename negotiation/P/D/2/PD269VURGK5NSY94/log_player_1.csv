Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$11,000** is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but lower than your minimum acceptable price ($12,000). 
* This gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing you to potentially earn a significant profit.
* If Bob rejects this offer, you can adjust your counteroffer based on his counterproposal. 
* Remember, you can always walk away and sell to John for $12,000 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't reach a satisfactory price."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is better than Bob's initial perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($12,000).  I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm offering a price of $10,500. This is a compromise, as it's halfway between my previous offer of $11,000 and Bob's offer of $9,500.
* This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not willing to go below my minimum acceptable price. 
* If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll have to decide whether to lower my price further or sell to John for $12,000."
