"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $800000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that I believe is fair considering its value to you.  Let's strike a deal that benefits us both.   
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still above your desired price range of $1,000,000. You can get the product from John for a slightly lower price, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best strategy in this case."
