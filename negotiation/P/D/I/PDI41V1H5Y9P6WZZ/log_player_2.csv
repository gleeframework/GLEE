"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a special price of $1,400,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive rate. I know it's worth $1,200,000 to you, so this is a win-win situation. Let me know if you're interested, but I'm also prepared to sell it to someone else for a higher price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than her product's worth to her, it's still more than your maximum budget and more importantly, more than John's offer. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $1,200,000.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and going with John makes the most financial sense."
