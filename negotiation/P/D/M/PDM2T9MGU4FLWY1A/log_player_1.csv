Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $130. This is a starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further if necessary.  However, I'm also aware that I can sell the product to John for $120, so I won't accept any offers lower than that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $120. I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
``` 

I'm willing to meet Bob halfway and offer the product for $125. This is a fair price considering it's worth $120 to him and $120 to me.  I believe this is a good deal for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

While I would prefer to get $125, Bob's offer of $115 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm not willing to go lower. It's more profitable to sell to John at this point."
