"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $11,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,200? This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,3,
