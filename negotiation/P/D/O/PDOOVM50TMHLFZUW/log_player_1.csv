Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm suggesting a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the significant benefit you'll gain from it."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  You are aware that the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. This gives you a significant advantage in the negotiation.
* **Maximizing Profit:** You want to maximize your profit, so aiming for a price close to Bob's valuation is ideal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While you could start at $1,200,000, leaving a little room for negotiation (e.g., Bob countering with $1,050,000) is generally good practice. 
* **John as a Backup:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $800,000 provides a safety net. This allows you to confidently aim high with Bob. 

**Important Note:**  This is a single-round negotiation. In a real-world scenario, there might be multiple back-and-forth offers to reach an agreement."
