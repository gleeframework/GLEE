,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is there any room for negotiation?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $14000, which is a significant discount from the original price. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to go up to $13000, but no more. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $13000. I can do $13500, which is still a discount from the original price. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to the price I'm comfortable with, but I still think $13500 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13250. Can you consider that?",13250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I can see you're making a serious effort to meet me in the middle. I'm willing to make one more concession - I can do $13500, but I need you to meet me at $13750. That's as low as I can go. What do you think?",13750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, but $13750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet at a price I'm comfortable with. I'd like to propose one last offer: $13000, take it or leave it.",13000.0,Bob,8,
