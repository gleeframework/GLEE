,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is around $9,000.  Would you be willing to come down to that?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9,000 is below my initial asking price, I'm willing to negotiate.  Could you meet me halfway at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit outside my budget.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,
