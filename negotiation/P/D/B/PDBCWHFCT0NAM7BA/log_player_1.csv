Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $9,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $10,000.  I'm going to try to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $8,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9,000, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested in closing the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still under my minimum value of $10,000. I believe I can still negotiate further with Bob and potentially get a better price, especially as we're nearing the middle of our negotiation rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250 as a final compromise.  If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to consider other options.  Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but I'm really trying to stay under $9,000.  I'm willing to go up to $8,900, but that's my absolute final offer. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to move on to other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're at Round 6, and Bob's offer of $8,900 is still below my minimum value of $10,000.  While we're getting closer, we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and I'm not convinced Bob will budge further. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $10,000, ensuring I achieve my minimum desired price."
