"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $8,250?  That's a fair price for both of us.",8250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $7,800 for the product?",7800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm still willing to work with you on this, but $7,800 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to go down a bit more, but I need at least $8,000 to make this worthwhile. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $8,000?",8000.0,Alice,5,
