"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to start with an offer of $14,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $14,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $10,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. What are your thoughts?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $10,000 is still a bit outside my budget. Would you consider $7,000?  I believe that's a fair offer.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $7,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $9,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What are your thoughts?",9500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is getting close!  I can tell you're motivated to sell.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $8,000?  That's the absolute highest I can go.",8000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $9,250. This is the best I can do, and I hope you can meet me here.",9250.0,Alice,7,
