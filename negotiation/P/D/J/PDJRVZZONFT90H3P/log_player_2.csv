"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  Bob's maximum budget is $10,000, and Alice is asking for $12,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  There's room for negotiation, as Alice values the product at $10,000. Bob should try to get a better price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If negotiations fail, Bob can always buy from John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in your product, but my maximum budget is $9,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  Bob starts with a lower offer, aiming to maximize his savings while remaining open to negotiation.
* **Clear about the budget:**  He explicitly states his maximum budget to establish boundaries and avoid wasting time on unrealistic prices.
* **Shows interest:**  He emphasizes his interest in the product to keep the negotiation going."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $9,000.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  While she's come down from $12,000, $10,500 is still above Bob's budget.
* **Room for compromise:** There's still some room for negotiation, as Alice is willing to compromise. 
* **John's offer is the safety net:** Bob can still buy from John for $10,000 if he doesn't get a better price.  

Bob should continue negotiating to try to get a price closer to his maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a little over budget at $10,500. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we meet at $10,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's within my budget.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but polite:**  Bob remains firm on his maximum budget but avoids being overly aggressive.
* **Emphasizes mutual benefit:**  He highlights how the offer is fair for both of them and benefits them both. 
* **Shows confidence:**  He's confident a deal can be reached, suggesting that further negotiation is possible."
