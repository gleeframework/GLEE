Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in your product, but my maximum budget is $9,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold. I'll try to get closer to my target price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $9,000.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a little over budget at $10,500. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we meet at $10,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's within my budget.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price. Accepting this offer ensures I reach my target price and avoids the risk of losing the sale completely."
