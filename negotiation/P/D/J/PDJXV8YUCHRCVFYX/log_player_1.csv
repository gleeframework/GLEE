"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting high with $1,500,000. This is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly more than my minimum:** This leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob incentive to bargain.
* **It's not unreasonable:** It's possible the product is worth this much to Bob, especially if he's unaware of my minimum.

I want to see if Bob is interested in this price and gauge his reaction before lowering my price."

(2) Reject Bob's offer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough one. Bob's offer is close to my minimum, but it's still below it. There's no more room for negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. I've already gone through a lot of rounds, and it's not clear that Bob is going to budge further. To avoid the risk of walking away with nothing, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  It's not my ideal price, but it's still a good amount of money and guarantees me a sale."
