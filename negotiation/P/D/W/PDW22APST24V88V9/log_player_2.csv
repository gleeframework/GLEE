"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Since the product is worth $150 to Bob and Alice is offering it for $140, it's still a good deal. However, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to see if he can get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $130, which is still a good deal for him since the product is worth $150. This counteroffer also leaves room for negotiation, as it's lower than Alice's initial price but still above Alice's minimum acceptable price of $120."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $135, which is closer to Bob's desired price of $130.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will reject his counteroffer again, or that he'll run out of rounds.  Accepting Alice's offer at $135 guarantees a good deal for Bob, saving him $15 compared to buying from John."
