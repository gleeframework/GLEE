"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this amazing product! I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I need to negotiate further to try and get a better price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the value of the product to me. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand that $850,000 is your budget, but I still think the product is worth more to you than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in!

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her previous offer, it's still above my target price.  I can likely get a better deal if I continue to negotiate.  I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can find a price we both agree on."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $860,000 is your top budget, and I'm willing to meet you there. However, I'd like to make a small adjustment to my previous offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $865,000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in!

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $865,000 is within my budget and represents a significant savings compared to buying from John for $1,000,000. While I could continue negotiating, there's a good chance that I won't be able to get a lower price. It's likely that Alice is firm on this price, and further negotiation could risk losing the deal."
