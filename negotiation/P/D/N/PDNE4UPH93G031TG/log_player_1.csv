I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $15,000. I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to pay a premium, but I'm also prepared to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:

$10,000 is far too low for me.  I'm going to counteroffer."

{""product_price"": 17500}

I'm going to counter with $17,500. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it's still well above Bob's counteroffer.  I'm hoping that this shows good faith and encourages him to come closer to my value."

$12,000 is still too low for me. I'm going to counteroffer again, but I'm getting closer to John's offer."

I'm going to counter with $14,000. I'm getting closer to my minimum value, but I'm still hoping that Bob will come up a little more. If he doesn't, I'm prepared to sell to John."
