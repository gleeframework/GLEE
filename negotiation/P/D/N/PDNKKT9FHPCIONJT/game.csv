"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product for $1,750,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let's start our negotiation with this initial offer.",1750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your product is interesting, but $1,750,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. This is my best offer, and I believe it's fair considering the value you've placed on the product.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still confident the product is worth more. Let's meet in the middle at $1,600,000. This price reflects the product's value while also being reasonable for both of us. What do you say?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000. I believe this offer is fair and allows us both to find common ground.  What do you think?",1450000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,525,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also being reasonable for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",1525000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,525,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is my absolute maximum.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that we're both trying to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's close this deal at this price.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
