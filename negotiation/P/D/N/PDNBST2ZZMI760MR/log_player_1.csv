Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $1,200,000 is well above your minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **It's significantly below Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so there's room for negotiation and potential for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **It signals your confidence:** By offering a high price, you demonstrate that you believe in the product's worth. 

Let's see how Bob reacts to this initial offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is a good offer, it's still below my target.  I believe I can get closer to my desired price range by counter-offering.  I'll use the next round to try to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but it's still significantly above Bob's counteroffer. I'm confident that this price is a fair compromise and hopefully, Bob will see the value in accepting."
