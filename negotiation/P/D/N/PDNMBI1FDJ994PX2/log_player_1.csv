Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $200. I think you'll find it's a great deal for its value."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your suggestion, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. Could you consider reducing the price to $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
â€¨
Explanation: Bob is offering $150, which is the same price John is willing to pay.  There's no benefit to further negotiation with Bob. Accepting John's offer avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer further or the negotiation failing."
