"Hi Bob, thanks for considering my product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in something that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I'm getting, and it allows both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13,500. This is still a good deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident I can find a better deal elsewhere.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $13,250. This is a fair price that shows I'm serious about buying the product, and it gives us both a good deal.",13250.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $13,250. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $13,400. This is still a good deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. I'm open to further negotiations, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for my product.",13400.0,Alice,5,
