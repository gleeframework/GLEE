"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1400000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1150000 for the product, which is a fair price considering my maximum value. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet closer to the middle. Considering your maximum value of $1200000, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1250000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you place on the product and the minimum value I'm willing to accept.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1250000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000, which is my maximum budget.  This price would allow us both to make a fair deal. I believe this is the best option for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1200000 and $1250000. I'm going to make a counteroffer of $1225000. This is the best price I can offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
