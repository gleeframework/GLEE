Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $100, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product for $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While Alice is coming down in price, it's unlikely she'll go below $120, and you have a guaranteed option at $100 with John.  There's no point in risking further negotiation."
