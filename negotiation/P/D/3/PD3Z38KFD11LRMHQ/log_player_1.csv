Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $800,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less from Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth significantly more to Bob ($1,200,000) than it is to you.
* **One Shot:** You only have one chance to make a deal with Bob.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your profit, but not so high that Bob walks away.  There's a ""sweet spot"" where you capture a significant portion of the value difference between you and Bob.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair.  This represents a substantial discount compared to what you stand to gain."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You start by emphasizing the product's value.
* **High Anchor:**  $1,100,000 sets a high starting point. While it's below Bob's maximum, it leaves room for negotiation if he wants to haggle.
* **Justification:** You frame the price as ""fair"" by highlighting the value Bob gains.

**Important Notes**

* **Bob's Response:** How Bob reacts will determine your next move. Be prepared to negotiate, but don't go below your $800,000 minimum.
* **Confidence:** Approach the negotiation with confidence. You have a valuable product and a backup plan."
