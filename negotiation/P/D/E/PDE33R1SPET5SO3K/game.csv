"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth while still leaving room for a mutually beneficial deal.  What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $1,300,000?  That's a significant discount from my initial offer, but it's still a fair price considering the value of this product.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000. Can you consider that?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
