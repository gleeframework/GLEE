Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to consider my minimum price for the product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,000.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the point where it's not worth my time to continue negotiating. However, I'm willing to make one last concession. I'll meet you at $10,000, which is still above your previous offer of $9,750. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, she's unlikely to reach a point where the deal is significantly better than John's offer of $8,000.  At this stage, the potential savings from continuing the negotiation with Alice are outweighed by the risk of her walking away or the final price being too close to John's offer anyway.  It's time to cut your losses and secure the product at the guaranteed lower price from John."
