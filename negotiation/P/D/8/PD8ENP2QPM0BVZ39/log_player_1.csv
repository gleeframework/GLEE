Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  $175 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down while still allowing me to earn more than my minimum. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encouraging to hopefully keep Bob engaged in the negotiation. 

**Important Note:**  I'm aware that John is willing to pay $150, but I'm hoping to get a better price from Bob.  This strategy relies on the possibility of a successful negotiation with Bob. I will be watching for signs that Bob is unwilling to negotiate and then I can switch to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal selling price and below what I know John will pay.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. I can try to meet Bob halfway, but I'm not willing to settle for $125. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain leverage in the negotiation. This shows him I'm serious about getting a fair price and encourages him to come up with a more reasonable counteroffer.

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer with a price closer to my ideal price point, but still within the range of what I believe Bob might be willing to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand $175 was a bit high.  I'm willing to come down to $150 for the product. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll love it.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I remind Bob of the product's value to emphasize that $150 is still a good deal for him. 
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a friendly and optimistic tone to encourage a positive response from Bob.

**Important Note:**  While I'm willing to sell the product to Bob for $150, I'm keeping John in mind. If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I'll switch to selling the product to John to guarantee my minimum profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $150, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum, but Not Ideal:**  While Bob's offer of $130 is closer to my minimum of $150, it's still below my ideal selling price. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks further lowering the price and potentially ending up with a deal below my minimum.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum profit of $150. 

**Conclusion:** Given the risk of further negotiation and the guaranteed profit from John, it's more prudent to sell the product to John. This ensures that I get a price I'm comfortable with and minimizes the risk of a deal that leaves me dissatisfied."
