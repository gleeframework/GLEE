"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $10,000. I'm willing to go up to $10,200. That's the highest I'm willing to go.",10200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $10,200. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,800. This is the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, Alice, but I'm still not willing to pay $10,800. I'm willing to meet you at $10,400. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",10400.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to meet you at $10,400, Bob. I think I've already made a significant concession. I'm willing to make one more offer, but it's my final one. I'll sell it to you for $10,600. This is the absolute lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",10600.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're making a final offer, Alice, but I'm still not willing to pay $10,600. I'm willing to meet you at $10,300. I think that's the highest I'm willing to go, and I'm starting to consider buying from John at $8,000 if we can't come to an agreement.",10300.0,Bob,8,

"I understand your position, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $10,300. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to give up any more value. I'll make one more offer, and it's my final one. I'll sell it to you for $10,500. This is the absolute highest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,9,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to pay $10,500. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000. If I don't get a better deal, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying from John at $8,000.",10000.0,Bob,10,
