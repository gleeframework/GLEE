"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to offer $850,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away with a good deal. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this price still represents a good value for you, considering the product's worth to you, and it's a fair reflection of its value to me. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's split the difference and agree on $900,000. This price is fair considering your value for the product and leaves room for me to make a profit.  What do you say?",900000.0,Bob,4,
