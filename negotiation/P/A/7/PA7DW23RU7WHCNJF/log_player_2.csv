"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great investment for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great addition to your collection.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is a good starting point, but there's still room for negotiation. You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and you know the product is worth $800,000 to Alice.  By rejecting her offer, you can make a counteroffer closer to that value."
