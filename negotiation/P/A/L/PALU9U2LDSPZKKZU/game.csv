"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $135 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $115? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125.  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to what the product is worth to me.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $125 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $120. That's a fair price for both of us, and it would be a great deal for me.",120.0,Bob,4,
