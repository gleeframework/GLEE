"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a significant discount from my original asking price, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you being willing to work with me on the price. $12,500 is closer, but I was hoping to be closer to $11,000. Would you be open to meeting somewhere in the middle?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. How about $11,500?  That's a good compromise, and I think it's fair considering the value of the product.",11500.0,Alice,5,
