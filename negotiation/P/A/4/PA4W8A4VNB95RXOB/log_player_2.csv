"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. It's best to negotiate a lower price, even if it means potentially going back and forth a few times."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($10,000) to give myself room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Polite and Interested:** The tone remains positive and expresses continued interest in the product.
* **Testing the Waters:** This first counteroffer will help gauge Alice's flexibility and willingness to negotiate a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a significant discount from my original asking price, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming closer to my acceptable range, but there's still a potential for savings. Getting her down another $500 would be ideal. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation since her counteroffer is still significantly above John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you being willing to work with me on the price. $12,500 is closer, but I was hoping to be closer to $11,000. Would you be open to meeting somewhere in the middle?"", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):**  I'm proposing a price that splits the difference between her last offer ($12,500) and my previous offer ($10,000), but leaning slightly more in my favor.
* **Maintaining Interest:** My message continues to express interest in finding a mutually agreeable price.
* **Strategic Counter:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while aiming for a price point that's a good deal for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. How about $11,500?  That's a good compromise, and I think it's fair considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $11,500 is a good price, saving me $500 compared to John's offer.
* **Time Value:** While I might be able to negotiate a slightly lower price, continuing the negotiation has diminishing returns. It's better to secure a good deal now. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's always a risk Alice might not go any lower, and I could end up paying John's price anyway."
