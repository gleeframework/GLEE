Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing your price point, but I have to be honest, going below $1,200,000 would be cutting into the true worth of this product. That's my absolute floor, and I'm firm on that. If you're able to meet that, we have a deal.

Alice has reached her minimum price and it matches what John is offering. There's no point in continuing the negotiation or going with John since the price will be the same."
