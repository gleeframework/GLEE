"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $115 is better than Alice's initial valuation of $120, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay. He has the option to get the product for $100 from John, so rejecting Alice's offer and counter-offering is the best initial strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to pay $105.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $105 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110.  It's still a good deal, and I think it's fair for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $110 is better than Alice's initial offer of $115, it's still more than what Bob is willing to pay.  Since he can get the product from John for $100, it's still better to reject Alice's offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? It's a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 107.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go any lower than $109.  This is already a significant discount from my initial price.  Let's close this deal, I think it's fair to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $109 is getting closer to Bob's desired price, but it's still higher than what he can get from John.  Since Bob is only willing to pay $100 maximum, it makes sense to buy from John to guarantee the best price and avoid further negotiation."
