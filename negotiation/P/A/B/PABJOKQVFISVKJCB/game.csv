,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to pay $105.  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $105 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110.  It's still a good deal, and I think it's fair for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? It's a fair compromise for both of us.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go any lower than $109.  This is already a significant discount from my initial price.  Let's close this deal, I think it's fair to both of us.",109.0,Alice,5,
