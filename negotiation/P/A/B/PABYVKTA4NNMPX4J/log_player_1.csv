Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:

While I'd prefer more, $900,000 is still a good deal and closer to my target.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the sale to John, making this the most advantageous option at this point."
