"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $8,000, leaving room for negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's initial interest and see how willing he is to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I still think I can get more. I'm going to reject and try for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,800. This is a small compromise from my initial offer, but it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this will be enough to get him to accept, but I'm also prepared to keep negotiating if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a bit more.  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I think there's still room for negotiation.  I'm going to see if I can push for a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9600}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,600.  This is a compromise from my previous offer, but still above Bob's last offer.  We are getting close to a deal, but I'm not ready to settle for his last offer yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While we're getting closer to a deal, I still think I can squeeze a bit more out of him.  I'm going to counter with a price closer to his last offer and see if we can finally close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9400}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,400.  This is a smaller step down from my previous offer, but it shows that I'm serious about making a deal.  This might be my final counteroffer, as I'm getting closer to my minimum price and don't want to risk losing the deal completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting very close to my minimum price of $8,000.  I've already rejected a few of his offers, and we're down to the wire.  It's risky to keep rejecting, as I might lose the deal completely.  I'm going to accept his offer and secure the sale."
