"Hey Alice, $135 is a good starting point, but I'm really looking to stay within my budget. How about $125? I'm genuinely interested in the product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  $125 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $130.  This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, I'm still a bit over budget at $130.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer you $127.50.  This way, we both get a fair deal, and I can finally grab this product I've been wanting.",127.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.  How about $129? It's a small step closer to your offer, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value of the product.",129.0,Alice,5,
