Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to sell it for $150. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Gauging Interest:**  By offering it at $150, we can see how interested Bob is. If he accepts immediately, we know we could have potentially gone higher. If he rejects, we can always fall back to John's offer. 
* **Justification:** The message implies the product's value is even higher than $150, potentially motivating Bob to buy it before someone else does."
