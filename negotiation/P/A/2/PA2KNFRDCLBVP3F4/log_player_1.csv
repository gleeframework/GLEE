Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  $85 is still a bit low, but I'll see what his next counteroffer is."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested in this price."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $90, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $87.50. Would you be open to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $87.50 is closer to my desired price, I think I can still push for a bit more. I'll counter with a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we split the difference this time and go with $88.50?  It's a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 88.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $88.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to go up to $86, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $86. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $86
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum, I'm going to see if I can get him to go just a bit higher. I'll counter with a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best possible price, but $86 is still a little lower than what I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle again at $87? This is a great deal for both of us, and we can finally close this transaction."", ""product_price"": 87}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to meet you at $87, Alice. I think I've already made a reasonable offer at $86. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm starting to think I should consider buying the product from John for $100. Can you really say you're getting a good deal at $87 when you're willing to sell it to me for $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $86. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $86
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly trying to push me down to his desired price, and I'm not sure I can get him to budge much more.  He's mentioning John now, which is a clear tactic to try and get me to accept a lower price.  At this point, it's better to just sell the product to John for $80 and avoid further negotiation."
