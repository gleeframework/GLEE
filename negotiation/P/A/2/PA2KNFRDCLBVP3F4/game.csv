"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested in this price.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $90, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $87.50. Would you be open to that price?",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we split the difference this time and go with $88.50?  It's a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal.",88.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $88.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to go up to $86, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price?",86.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best possible price, but $86 is still a little lower than what I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle again at $87? This is a great deal for both of us, and we can finally close this transaction.",87.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to meet you at $87, Alice. I think I've already made a reasonable offer at $86. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm starting to think I should consider buying the product from John for $100. Can you really say you're getting a good deal at $87 when you're willing to sell it to me for $80?",86.0,Bob,8,
