"Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find immensely valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe it's a bit above the market value, considering the current market trends and the product's specifications. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it's a fair price for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the market value, but I believe the true value of this product goes beyond current trends. It offers unique advantages that justify a premium price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective on the product's unique advantages, but I still think $1,350,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but this time I'm thinking of $1,250,000. I'm trying to find a sweet spot that balances the product's value with my budget. Can we discuss further?",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've tried to be flexible, but I have a firm bottom line. I'm willing to accept $1,300,000 for the product.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of its value.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your firm bottom line, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000. I'm willing to make one last push to try to meet in the middle. I'm thinking of $1,275,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
