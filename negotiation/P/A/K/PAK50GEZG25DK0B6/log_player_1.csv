Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe it's a bit above the market value, considering the current market trends and the product's specifications. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:

While I could hold out for more, Bob is clearly very interested and willing to pay a significant amount over my minimum. Accepting his offer of $1,275,000 is a strong outcome.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing him entirely, which would mean accepting the $1,000,000 from John."
