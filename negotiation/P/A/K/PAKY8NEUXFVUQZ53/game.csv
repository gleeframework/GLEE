"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,000 is a bit lower than I'd like, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a good price for the value you'll get, and it's closer to what I need. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford, how about $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,500.  This is my final offer. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $9,500 is still a little more than I was hoping to spend. How about we split the difference and settle at $9,250? ",9250.0,Bob,6,
