Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $150. I think you'll find it's a great value at this price."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed, and you might be surprised â€“ Bob could accept your initial offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering the product at $150 leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, keeping the negotiation open. 
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys confidence in the product's value, which can influence Bob's perception of the price.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $120 is closer to his perceived value, it's still below my initial asking price and leaves room for further negotiation. I'm confident I can get closer to $130-$140 before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $120 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $135?"", 
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** I've shown a willingness to negotiate by reducing the price from $150 to $135. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:** Suggesting a price directly in the middle of our previous offers is a common negotiation tactic. It can feel fair to both parties and encourage agreement. 
* **Maintaining Value:**  By not dropping the price too drastically, I'm still emphasizing the product's value and aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $135 is a bit high for me. How about we meet at $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly anchored at a price point around $125. While I could try to push for a slightly higher price, the difference is now relatively small. Accepting $125 gives me a good profit over my minimum ($100) and avoids the risk of Bob walking away or the negotiation dragging on."
