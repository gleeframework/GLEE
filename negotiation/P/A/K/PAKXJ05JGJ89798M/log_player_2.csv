"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer because you can get the product for a lower price from John.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price, but you have a guaranteed lower price option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's lower than Alice's offer but still higher than what John is selling it for. This leaves room for negotiation while still making sure you're getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still higher than John's price, and there's no guarantee that further negotiation will get you a better price. It's better to secure the product from John for the guaranteed lower price."
