"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its value. I'm willing to start with a price of $1500000. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,,

"I appreciate the enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $1500000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to consider a price of $900000. Can we discuss further and see if we can meet in the middle?",900000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,1200000.0
"I understand that $900000 is a bit low for me, but I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1200000. This is my best price for now, and I'm not willing to go any lower than that.",1200000.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1200000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1050000, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet in the middle again?",1050000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,1100000.0
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer it to you for $1100000. This is a compromise, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1100000.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1100000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1000000, which is the absolute maximum I can go. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1000000.0,Bob,6,,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I can offer it to you for $1050000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",1050000.0,Alice,7,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to think we're getting close to the bottom line. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I can offer it to you for $1000000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finally come to an agreement at this price.",1000000.0,Alice,9,,
