"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you our premium product! It's a unique opportunity to own a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $20000.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $20000 is far beyond my budget. While I am interested in your product, I can only offer $8000 at this time.  Let me know if that's something you're willing to consider.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is a significant discount, but I'm afraid I can't accept it. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $16000. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to own this unique item.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16000 is still too high for me. My absolute maximum is $10000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise there.  If not, I'll have to consider other options.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is your maximum, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. Considering the value it brings, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm offering it to you for $12500. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to own this unique item.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $12500 is still outside my budget. I'm firmly at $10000, and I believe this is a fair price considering the back-and-forth we've had. If you're unable to accept this offer, I will have to seriously consider purchasing from John at $8000.",10000.0,Bob,6,
