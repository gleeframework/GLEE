"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we get started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $800000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $800000 is significantly below what I'm willing to pay. I'm prepared to offer $1000000 for the product, which is still a fair price given its value. I'm confident this is a good starting point for our negotiations.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're willing to pay $1000000, but I'm not ready to accept that just yet. I'd like to counter with an offer of $950000. I believe this is a more reasonable compromise, considering the product's value to you. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below this price.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my offer. However, $950000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to offer $975000.  This price reflects the value of the product and is within my budget. Let's see if we can close the deal.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go below $975000. I'd like to counter with an offer of $980000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",980000.0,Alice,5,
