{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Alice's goal is to get as much money as possible. She knows she has a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 to John.
* **Finding a Balance:** Offering the product at $1,500,000 or close to it would likely deter Bob, as it's more than its worth to him. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $1,350,000 aims to find a middle ground:
    * It's significantly more than Bob values the product for, giving Alice room for negotiation.
    * It's still a substantial profit for Alice even if she has to come down slightly in price. 

This strategy prioritizes trying to secure a deal with Bob at a higher price while still having the safety net of John's offer."
