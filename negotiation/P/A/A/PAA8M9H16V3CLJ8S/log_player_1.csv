"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, giving Bob room to negotiate while still leaving me with a substantial profit. I believe this will encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation and hopefully lead to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,200,000. It's not worth selling at that price. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,300,000. This is still a good profit for me, and hopefully a more reasonable price for Bob, bridging the gap between his offer and my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'll counteroffer again in the next round.  While selling to John would guarantee my minimum, I'm still hopeful that I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $1,250,000.  This is a small step closer to Bob's offer, but it still ensures a good profit for me.  With only five rounds remaining, I'm getting closer to the decision point of selling to John or continuing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. With only four rounds remaining, I'm getting closer to the point where selling to John becomes the safer option, but I'm still hopeful that I can get a slightly better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1225000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,225,000.  This is only a small step down from my minimum value, but I'm hoping that with only three rounds left, Bob will feel the pressure to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds remaining, I'm running out of time to get a better offer from Bob. While $1,175,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not confident that I can get a higher offer in the next round.  To guarantee a sale above my minimum value, I'll sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
