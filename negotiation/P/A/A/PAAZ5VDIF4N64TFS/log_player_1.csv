"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe its value to you makes it a compelling opportunity. I'm willing to part with it for $1,700,000.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1700000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This gives us room for negotiation and allows me to aim for a price closer to my minimum ($1,500,000).
* **Positive message:** I'm using positive language to make Bob feel valued and open to negotiation.
* **Highlighting value:** I emphasize the product's potential value to Bob to encourage him to consider my offer. 

**Note:** This is just the starting point. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1700000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $850,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:** While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's interested. This means there's room for further negotiation. 
* **Aiming for a higher price:** By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer that's closer to my target price and potentially secure a better deal. 

**Next Steps:** In the next round, I will make a counteroffer that is still significantly higher than Bob's offer but perhaps a bit lower than my initial offer, aiming for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is unfortunately too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This is a significant compromise, but I value your interest in the product and believe it's a fair price reflecting its value to both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise but not surrender:** I'm lowering my price significantly from the initial $1,700,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still keeping the price above my minimum to protect my interests.
* **Highlighting the compromise:**  I emphasize that this is a ""significant compromise"" to show Bob I'm making an effort.
* **Finding common ground:** I use language like ""fair price"" and ""common ground"" to encourage Bob to see the value in my offer and to continue negotiating.

**Next Steps:** I will carefully observe Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects this offer, I might consider making a small further adjustment in my next counteroffer, but I will be cautious not to go too low too quickly. I'm also keeping the option of selling to John in mind if the negotiations with Bob don't lead to a satisfactory outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1200000 is still beyond my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $950000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer. This demonstrates my genuine interest in the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $950,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and his offer is higher than his previous one.  This suggests there's still room to find a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Aiming for a better deal:**  By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer that's closer to my target price and potentially secure a better deal.

**Next Steps:** In the next round, I will make a counteroffer that is closer to my minimum but still lower than my previous offer, continuing to show my willingness to compromise while aiming to secure a higher price. I will also keep a close eye on the remaining rounds and consider selling to John if the negotiations with Bob don't reach a satisfactory outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and your offer is getting closer to where we need to be. However, $950,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. Let's keep working towards a deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Further compromise:** I'm lowering my price again, but keeping it well above Bob's offer and still within my desired range. This shows a continued willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasis on compromise:** I reiterate that this is a ""significant compromise"" to reinforce the idea that I'm making an effort.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:** I use language like ""keep working towards a deal"" to maintain a constructive dialogue and encourage Bob to continue negotiating.

**Next Steps:**  I'll be observing Bob's response carefully. If he rejects this offer, I'll need to decide whether to make another counteroffer or consider selling to John. The remaining rounds are getting limited, so I need to be strategic and consider the potential for a deal with Bob versus the guaranteed sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  However, $1100000 is still beyond what I can afford.  I'm going to make one final offer of $1000000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I hope you'll consider it seriously.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $1,000,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Limited rounds:** We are now in round 6, and the pressure is mounting. We have only 4 rounds remaining. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  While Bob has stated this is his final offer, there is still a possibility of securing a higher price. There are still rounds left, and I'm not ready to accept a price that is significantly lower than my minimum.

**Next Steps:** I'll make a counteroffer that is closer to my minimum but still lower than my previous offer, continuing to show my willingness to compromise. I'll also be prepared to sell to John if the negotiation with Bob does not lead to a satisfactory outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your final offer and see we're nearing the end of our negotiation. While $1,000,000 is tempting, it's still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, a significant step for me, but I believe this represents a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small compromise:** I'm only lowering my price by $50,000, demonstrating that I'm  firm on my minimum. 
* **Emphasis on fairness:** I use the phrase ""fair price for both of us"" to appeal to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Last chance tone:** I mention it's ""nearing the end of our negotiation"" to create a sense of urgency.

**Next Steps:** 
I'll be closely watching Bob's response.  If he rejects this offer, I'll need to make a final decision on whether to sell to John or try one last counteroffer with Bob.  I'm running out of time, so I need to be decisive."
