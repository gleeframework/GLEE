"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe its value to you makes it a compelling opportunity. I'm willing to part with it for $1700000.  Let me know your thoughts!",1700000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1700000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiations.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850000 is unfortunately too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1200000.  This is a significant compromise, but I value your interest in the product and believe it's a fair price reflecting its value to both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1200000 is still beyond my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $950000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer. This demonstrates my genuine interest in the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and your offer is getting closer to where we need to be. However, $950000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This is a significant compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. Let's keep working towards a deal.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  However, $1100000 is still beyond what I can afford.  I'm going to make one final offer of $1000000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I hope you'll consider it seriously.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your final offer and see we're nearing the end of our negotiation. While $1000000 is tempting, it's still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1050000, a significant step for me, but I believe this represents a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
