"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11500. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $12000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the deal, I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the price as close to Alice's value ($10,000) as possible without risking losing the deal entirely.  A $1,000 discount is a significant offer, while still leaving room for Alice to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $11000? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm sure we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While Alice's new offer is closer to his desired price, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows him to make another counteroffer and potentially get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're not ready to go as low as I initially offered, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,750. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground between his initial offer and Alice's current offer. By offering $10,750, he's showing a willingness to compromise while still aiming to save money. This counteroffer is likely to be more appealing to Alice than his previous one, increasing the chances of a successful negotiation."
