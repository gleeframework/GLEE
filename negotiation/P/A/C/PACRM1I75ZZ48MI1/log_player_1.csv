Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen. I'm willing to make a special offer just for you at $1,300,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, you start the negotiation significantly above Bob's perceived value.
* **Room for negotiation:** The offer leaves some room for Bob to negotiate, making him feel more in control.
* **Justification for the price:** Highlighting Bob's ""business acumen"" subtly implies the product's value is higher than what he might think.
* **""Special offer"" framing:** This makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal, even though the price is still very favorable to you.

By starting high, you anchor the negotiation in your favor. While Bob might negotiate the price down, it's unlikely he'll go as low as $800,000, and you still have John as a backup."
