"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  The product sounds interesting, but $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $650000 for it.  I'm serious about buying this product, but need to be sure the price is right for me.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $750000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and rarity.",750000.0,Alice,3,
