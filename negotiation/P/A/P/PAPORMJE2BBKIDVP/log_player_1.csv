Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less.  How about $1,050,000? That's still a fair price for both of us.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's still a good deal, and I'm running out of time.  It's better to secure a profit than risk losing the sale entirely and having to settle for John's lower price."
