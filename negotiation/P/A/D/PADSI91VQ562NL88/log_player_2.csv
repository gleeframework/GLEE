"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire this valuable product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000, which is a fair price considering its worth to you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is clearly stating that the product's worth to you is $1,200,000, implying there's no room for negotiation.  Since you can buy it for the same price from John, there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer."
