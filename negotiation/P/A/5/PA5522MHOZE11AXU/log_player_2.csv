"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a one-time offer to you, and I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,400,000. This is a fair price, considering its value to you is $1,200,000, and it's a great deal considering the alternative is to sell it to someone else for $1,500,000.
