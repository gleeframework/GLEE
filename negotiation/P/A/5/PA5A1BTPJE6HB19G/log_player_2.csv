Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,900,000 is my initial offer reflecting the product's value, I'm open to negotiation.  To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to come down to $1,600,000. I believe this price point represents a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer.  I understand your position, but the product's value warrants a higher price.  I'm willing to consider $1,350,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise to find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down, her ""final offer"" of $1,350,000 is still significantly higher than John's price of $1,200,000. It's unlikely Alice will go much lower, and it makes more financial sense to buy from John at this point."
