"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be a good addition to my portfolio, but not at that cost. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,900,000 is my initial offer reflecting the product's value, I'm open to negotiation.  To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to come down to $1,600,000. I believe this price point represents a fair deal for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,600,000 is still too high for me.  I can go up to $1,100,000. That's a fair offer, and I think it would be beneficial for both of us to close this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer.  I understand your position, but the product's value warrants a higher price.  I'm willing to consider $1,350,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise to find common ground.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
