"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I'm confident it will greatly benefit you.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $900,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,100,000. This offer reflects the product's worth and ensures a fair deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
