"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,250,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering my value for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, the price needs to be closer to  $1,900,000 for this to work for me.  This offer reflects the true value of the product and the potential returns it offers. Are you open to reconsidering?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,900,000 is still too high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it reflects a fair value given the product's potential.  Let's aim for a deal that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer. I appreciate you moving on price.  To be completely transparent, I have a hard minimum of $1,500,000 for this product due to its unique value.  Could you meet me halfway at $1,400,000 and we'll have a deal?",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your minimum price, but I'm still not able to go that high. I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000, which is a significant compromise for me. This is a fair price considering my valuation and the need for a quick deal. Let's finalize this and avoid any further delays.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
