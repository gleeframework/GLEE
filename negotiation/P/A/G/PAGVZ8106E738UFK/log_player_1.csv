{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product, which I believe holds great value for your company. My asking price is $1,150,000. This price reflects the product's high quality and potential, while leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm confident this will be a valuable investment for you. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $1,150,000, leaving room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum requirement of $1,000,000.
* **Framing it positively:**  I emphasize the product's value and potential for Bob, creating a sense of opportunity.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm not presenting this as a take-it-or-leave-it offer, showing flexibility and willingness to work together. 

This initial offer sets the stage for a potentially successful negotiation while also providing a strong starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1050000. This price reflects the value I see in the product while still allowing for a profitable deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can bridge the gap, hoping to get closer to my ideal price of $1,150,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $1,050,000 doesn't quite cover the true value of this product and the resources I've invested in it. I'm prepared to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant concession on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away with a profitable deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's position:** I show respect for his counteroffer, but I still reiterate my belief in the product's value.
* **Making a counteroffer:**  I've come down from my initial price by $50,000, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Reframing the offer:**  I emphasize that this is a ""significant concession"" and a ""fair price"" to encourage acceptance. 
* **Positive tone:**  I remain optimistic and hopeful for a mutually beneficial outcome."
