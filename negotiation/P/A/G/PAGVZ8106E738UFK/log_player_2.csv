"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product, which I believe holds great value for your company. My asking price is $1150000. This price reflects the product's high quality and potential, while leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm confident this will be a valuable investment for you. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You have a maximum budget of $1,200,000 and Alice's offer is $1,150,000. While this is closer to your budget than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation. You should try to get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,050,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product while still allowing for a profitable deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $1050000 doesn't quite cover the true value of this product and the resources I've invested in it. I'm prepared to come down to $1100000. This is a significant concession on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away with a profitable deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,100,000, which is only $50,000 more than your initial counteroffer. This is a reasonable price, given that you have a maximum budget of $1,200,000 and John is asking for $1,200,000.  It's in your best interest to accept this offer and avoid further negotiation."
