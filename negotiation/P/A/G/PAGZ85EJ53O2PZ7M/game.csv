"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product.  Let me know if you're interested in that price.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12500 is still a little more than I'm comfortable paying. How about $11500? I think this price is fair for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go below $13000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer it to you for $12750. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great compromise. What do you think?",12750.0,Alice,5,
