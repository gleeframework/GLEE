{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's better to reject and make a counteroffer, or go directly to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a lowball offer of $9,000.  This is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  I want to see if Alice is willing to come down significantly from her initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, but closer to what I'm willing to pay. I will reject and try to get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, showing she's willing to negotiate. I'm raising my offer to $11,000, which is still lower than her offer but closer to my budget. This shows I'm serious about buying the product and willing to pay a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's closer to my budget, it's still not worth it to me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, and John is offering it at that price. It's better to go with the guaranteed deal and avoid further negotiation."
