"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it's truly valuable and could benefit you greatly.  I'm happy to start the conversation at $16,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $16,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $8,500 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This feels like a fair price that reflects the true value of this product."", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $13,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob increased his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to go much higher than his ""final offer"" of $10,000. Accepting that offer means a $2,000 loss compared to John's guaranteed offer. It's time to cut my losses and secure a sure thing."
