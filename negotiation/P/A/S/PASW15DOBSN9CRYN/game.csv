"Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your perspective on the value, however, I'm confident that this product can bring you even greater returns in the long run.  How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000?",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your confidence in the product's potential, but I'm still not convinced that it's worth $2,000,000 to me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,900,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
