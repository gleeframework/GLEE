Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a price closer to my value while leaving room for negotiation. This offer is likely to be rejected by Bob, but it sets the stage for a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum, it's still closer to his value than to mine.  Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open, allowing me to potentially get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but I'm still aiming for a figure closer to my value. This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still maintaining a price point that is closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is now getting dangerously close to his value and significantly below mine.  While I could keep negotiating, there's a risk of going back and forth for several more rounds without getting a better deal.  John offers a guaranteed price that meets my minimum, so selling to him is the best option at this point."
