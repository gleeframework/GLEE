"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think I can do better than that. How about $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see you're serious about this product. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I still need to make a profit. How about we meet at $14,500? It's a fair price, considering the value the product brings",14500.0,Alice,5,
