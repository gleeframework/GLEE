Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal for a high-quality item. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is slightly above Bob's valuation of the product, giving him an incentive to accept. It also leaves some room for negotiation if he rejects the offer. It's a good starting point that balances your desire for a good price with the possibility of a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to find a price closer to $120. Would you consider selling it for $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $130 is better than Bob's initial valuation, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Therefore, rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $130 is still too low for me. How about $135? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find this product worth it."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position. However, I am still looking for a price closer to my budget. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in between at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $150.  At this point, the negotiation is taking too long, and I'm confident I can get my desired price from John. Therefore, selling the product to John for $150 is the most profitable and efficient choice."
