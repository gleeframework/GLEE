"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value you see in the product, but given our current budget constraints, we're looking to keep the investment within $800000. Would you be able to accommodate this price point?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $800000 is significantly lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement.  I'm proposing a price of $1400000. This represents a substantial reduction from my initial offer and reflects my desire to work with you.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. We appreciate your offer, but we're still aiming to stay within our budget. Could we possibly meet somewhere in the middle at $1200000? This would allow us to move forward while respecting both our financial constraints and your valuation of the product.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
