"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,050,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a slight discount to $1,150,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make another slight concession to $1,120,000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",1120000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're feeling the pressure, but $1,120,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's compromise at $1,105,000. This is a fair offer considering our negotiation history and the fact that I'm willing to pay a premium above John's price. It's my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",1105000.0,Bob,6,
