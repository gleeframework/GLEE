Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000, which is a great price considering its value. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've chosen $10,000 as my offer. This is a good starting point because it's more than Bob's valuation but less than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Message:** My message is friendly and highlights the product's value to Bob. I'm emphasizing the good price to make the offer more appealing. 

**Why this strategy is good:**

* **Maximize potential profit:** This price gives me the best chance of selling to Bob, potentially earning $2,000 more than selling to John. 
* **Avoid risk:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I still have John as a backup buyer at my minimum acceptable price."
