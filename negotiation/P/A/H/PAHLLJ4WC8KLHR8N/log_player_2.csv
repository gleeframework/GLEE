Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $600,000 is significantly below what I need to consider.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $800,000. This allows you to acquire a valuable product while still staying within a reasonable price range. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this offer.
