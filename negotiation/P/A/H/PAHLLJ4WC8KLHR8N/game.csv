"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $600,000 is significantly below what I need to consider.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $800,000. This allows you to acquire a valuable product while still staying within a reasonable price range. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this offer.",800000.0,Alice,3,
