"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $1,200,000.  It's a fair price, considering the value it holds for both of us. Let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer lined up who's also willing to pay that amount. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you are willing to pay a maximum of $1,200,000, and Alice is offering the product at exactly that price, there is no room for negotiation.  Rejecting Alice's offer means you will buy the product from John for the same price.  This does not save you money, but it avoids the risk of Alice finding another buyer."
