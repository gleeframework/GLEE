Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This gives me a good starting point that's higher than my minimum, and leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium, but I'm also prepared to negotiate down if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not in a rush. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm going to counter with $18,000. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is only $1,000 less than my initial counteroffer and $1,000 more than what John is offering. I'm willing to accept this offer since it is very close to my initial desired value and I'm not sure if I can get a better price from Bob in the next round."
