"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,500. I know it's valuable to you and this is a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is better than John's price of $12,000.  Even though Bob values the product at $12,000, accepting Alice's offer saves him $500."
