"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'd love.  I'm offering it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't regret it!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $110, slightly above my minimum threshold of $100. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Positive messaging:** I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Confidence:** I'm expressing confidence in the product's value to create a sense of urgency.

This first offer is a strategic opening move. We'll see how Bob responds and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $60 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $60 is significantly lower than my minimum threshold of $100, and even lower than the $80 value he places on the product. Accepting this offer would be a huge loss for me. While selling to John for $100 is tempting,  I have 10 rounds to negotiate with Bob and I believe I can achieve a better price than John's offer.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired range.  I'll start by suggesting a price slightly lower than my initial offer of $110, but still higher than Bob's $60 offer. I'll also explain that his offer is too low but I'm willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer, but $60 is unfortunately too far below my asking price.  I'm willing to be flexible, though.  How about $90?  It's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's offer:** I acknowledge Bob's offer to show that I'm taking his perspective seriously.
* **Explaining my reasoning:** I state clearly why his offer is unacceptable.
* **Offering a compromise:** I propose a new price of $90, which is a compromise between our initial positions. 
* **Positive language:** I use positive language to encourage Bob to accept the counteroffer.

This counteroffer is designed to be a more realistic starting point for further negotiation. I am still aiming for a price closer to my minimum threshold of $100, but I'm also demonstrating a willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to find a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $75 is closer to my minimum threshold than his previous offer, it's still below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm still confident that I can negotiate a better price. Selling to John for $100 is tempting, but I have a few more rounds to work with Bob and potentially reach a mutually acceptable price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming for a price that's closer to my desired range of $90 or higher. I'll also try to emphasize the value of the product and reiterate my willingness to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $75 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $85.  It's a fair price, and it would allow us to close this deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Compromise:** I acknowledge Bob's compromise to show I'm listening and willing to negotiate.
* **Splitting the Difference:**  Proposing $85, which is exactly in the middle of our current positions, is a fair and reasonable approach.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:** I reiterate that $85 is a fair price for both of us, highlighting the mutual benefit of closing the deal.
* **Encouraging Acceptance:** I use a question at the end to encourage Bob to consider my offer and potentially accept.

This counteroffer is a strong compromise, demonstrating my willingness to work with Bob while still protecting my interests. I'm confident this offer has a good chance of closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close! I'm willing to go up slightly. How about $78? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $78 is still below my minimum threshold of $100 and below the value he places on the product. While we are getting closer, I have a few more rounds and I believe I can negotiate a better price. Selling to John for $100 is tempting, but I'm confident I can reach a mutually acceptable price with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $85. I'll emphasize that $78 is still too low and reiterate my willingness to compromise.  I will also emphasize the benefits of the product and the value it offers to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to increase your offer. However, $78 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm still willing to compromise, though.  How about we settle on $82? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it allows us to close this deal without further delays.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 82}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Progress:**  I acknowledge Bob's increased offer to show I'm paying attention to his position.
* **Reaffirming Compromise:** I reiterate my willingness to compromise, demonstrating flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Fair and Reasonable Price:**  I propose $82, which is closer to my desired price while still reflecting a willingness to meet in the middle.
* **Urgency and Closure:**  I emphasize closing the deal without further delays, adding a sense of urgency and incentivizing Bob to accept.

This counteroffer is a strategic move to push Bob towards a more acceptable price while remaining open to negotiation. It aims to find a balance between pushing for a higher price and ensuring a deal is reached within the remaining rounds."
