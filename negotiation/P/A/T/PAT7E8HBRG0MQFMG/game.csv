"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering it's worth a lot more to me. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and meet at $11,000? I'm still willing to negotiate further, but I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,200? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget",10200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to work with me. $10,200 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to make one last compromise. How about $10,800?  This is really as low as I can go, but I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",10800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $10,800 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,200 and $10,800. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to go down to $10,700, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. If you're still interested, let me know, but if not, I'll have to move on to another buyer.  ",10700.0,Alice,7,

"I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $10,700 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,400, but that's as high as I can go. Please let me know if that's acceptable to you",10400.0,Bob,8,
