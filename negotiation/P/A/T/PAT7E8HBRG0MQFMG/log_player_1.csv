"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering it's worth a lot more to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing that the product is worth more to me, implying a good deal for Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** This price allows for several rounds of negotiation without immediately reaching my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $9,500 is significantly below my minimum of $15,000.  
* **Negotiation Potential:** While it's tempting to take $9,500, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price with further negotiation. 
* **Exploring Options:**  I'll reject Bob's offer for now and see if I can improve the price in subsequent rounds. If that fails, I can always sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and meet at $11,000? I'm still willing to negotiate further, but I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm responding to Bob's counteroffer with my own, showing that I'm open to negotiation but not willing to accept his initial price.
* **Splitting the Difference:** Offering to split the difference creates a sense of compromise and fairness. 
* **Maintaining Value:** I'm still above my minimum while also showing flexibility.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a friendly tone keeps the conversation constructive and encourages continued negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,200? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $10,200 is still below my minimum price of $15,000.
* **Further Negotiation Potential:** While Bob is showing some flexibility, I believe I can still push for a higher price with more negotiation. 
* **Selling to John is a Safe Option:**  It's good to know that I have a guaranteed $15,000 offer from John, so I'm not under pressure to accept anything below my minimum.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to work with me. $10,200 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to make one last compromise. How about $10,800?  This is really as low as I can go, but I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10800}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This counteroffer signals my willingness to reach an agreement while still maintaining a price above $10,000. 
* **Creating Urgency:** Mentioning ""one last compromise"" subtly pressures Bob to make a decision.
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:** I continue to be friendly and encouraging, aiming to keep the conversation amicable.
* **Assessing Risk:** If Bob rejects this offer, I might be inclined to sell to John, but I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $10,800 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,200 and $10,800. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob is showing more flexibility, $10,500 is still below my minimum price of $15,000.
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:** We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. I need to make sure I don't waste time on offers that are too low.
* **John is a Safe Alternative:** With only a few rounds remaining, selling to John for $15,000 is looking more and more appealing. 

I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round. If not, I'll likely sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to go down to $10,700, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. If you're still interested, let me know, but if not, I'll have to move on to another buyer.  "", ""product_price"": 10700}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This counteroffer is a small concession, showing I'm open to compromise but still holding onto a price closer to my desired value.
* **Creating Urgency:**  The statement about moving on to another buyer subtly adds pressure on Bob to make a decision.
* **Assessing the Risk:**  This is my final attempt to get closer to my desired price. If Bob rejects this, I'll most likely sell to John in the next round.
* **Positive but Firm Tone:** The tone remains positive but also firm, signaling that I'm serious about the price and willing to walk away if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $10,700 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,400, but that's as high as I can go. Please let me know if that's acceptable to you 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Rounds:**  We're down to our last two rounds.
* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,400 is still below my minimum of $15,000.
* **Guaranteed Deal:** Selling to John guarantees me $15,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's offer.  

The risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob is too high. Even if I could get him to agree to a price closer to my minimum, there's no guarantee that he won't reject my next offer. Selling to John is the safest and most profitable option at this point."
