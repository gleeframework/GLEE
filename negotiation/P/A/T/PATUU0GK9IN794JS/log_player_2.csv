You're trying to save as much money as possible. While $110 is within your budget, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice. There's room for negotiation."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $95 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

Round 4
