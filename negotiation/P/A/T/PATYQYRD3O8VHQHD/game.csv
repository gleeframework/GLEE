"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit out of your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I can meet you halfway at $140. Would you be willing to consider that?",140.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer it to you for $145. Let me know if that works for you.",145.0,Alice,5,
