""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant return on investment you'll experience."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Knowing the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob allows for an ambitious starting price, aiming to secure a significant portion of the potential profit.
* **Room for negotiation:**  The offer leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, while still staying well above your minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""value"" and ""potential ROI"" aims to justify the high price and shift focus towards the product's benefits for Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's personality:** If you have insights into Bob's negotiating style (e.g., aggressive, agreeable), you can tailor the message and price accordingly.
* **Alternative buyers:**  While John provides a safety net, mentioning other interested parties could create a sense of urgency and competition. 

This offer balances ambition with the need to secure a deal, aiming to maximize your profit while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
