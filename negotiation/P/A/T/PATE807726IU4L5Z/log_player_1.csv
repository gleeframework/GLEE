Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, making this your ""walk-away"" point.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a potential $200,000 surplus to negotiate.
* **Information Asymmetry:** You know John's offer, but Bob doesn't. This gives you an advantage.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your profit, but not so high that Bob walks away. A good strategy is to:

1. **Start High:** Begin with an offer closer to Bob's perceived value. 
2. **Leave Room to Negotiate:**  Don't start at Bob's maximum; allow for some back and forth.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,150,000. I'm confident this represents a fair deal considering the significant return you'll see."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** $1,150,000 is a strong opening, leaving you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Confident Language:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""fair deal"" subtly emphasize the product's value.
* **Focus on Bob's ROI:** Highlighting the ""significant return"" speaks directly to Bob's motivation for buying. 

**Important Note:**  This is just one approach.  You could start even higher, but be prepared to justify the price and potentially negotiate down towards $1,050,000 to secure the deal with Bob over John."
