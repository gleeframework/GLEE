Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Leverage:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your minimum price.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high with Bob, knowing you have John as a safety net.  The key is to find a price that's appealing to Bob but also maximizes your profit.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential benefits it holds for you."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Target Price:**  $1,400,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significant portion of the potential profit.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value"" and ""potential benefits"" subtly reminds Bob of its worth to him. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The wording implies you might be flexible, encouraging Bob to engage.

**Important Notes**

* **Bob's Response:** How Bob responds will determine your next move. If he counter-offers, you can negotiate further, knowing your bottom line is $1,200,000.
* **Confident Demeanor:**  Even with John as a backup, project confidence in your offer. This makes you a stronger negotiator."
