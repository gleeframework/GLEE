I'm starting with my desired price of $1,200,000. While Bob likely won't accept this immediately, it establishes my starting point and leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident in my product's value and my ability to walk away with the sale to John if necessary."

I'm offering a counteroffer at $1,100,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still holding a price that's closer to my desired value. I hope this counteroffer will encourage Bob to meet me halfway."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still not enough. I've gone down considerably from my initial asking price and further negotiation might not result in a significantly higher offer.  I've decided to sell to John for $1,200,000 to ensure I reach my minimum acceptable price and avoid further negotiations."
