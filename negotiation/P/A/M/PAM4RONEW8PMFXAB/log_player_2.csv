"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. A counteroffer of $12,000 is a significant step down from Alice's offer and still leaves room for negotiation. This offer should test Alice's willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $13,500 is a better price than the first offer, he can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Alice. There are still 7 rounds left, and he can still get the product for less than $13,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his target price.  This counteroffer is a compromise between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer, showing that he is willing to meet halfway.  He still has 6 rounds left, and can continue to negotiate if Alice rejects this offer."
