Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're highlighting, $1,400,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $1,300,000.  Let me know what you think.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,325,000. This represents a substantial saving for me, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to find common ground here.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,337,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's try $1,312,500. This would allow me to acquire the product while ensuring you also get a good deal.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,312,500.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,312,500
