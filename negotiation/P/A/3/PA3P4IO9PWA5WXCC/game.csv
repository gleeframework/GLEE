"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was hoping we could work together to find a price that's more suitable for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your transparency about your budget. However, I'm afraid I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. Considering the product's value to you is $1200000, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1050000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable compromise considering the value you've placed on the product. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of a price of $1050000 was a bit too low for me, but $950000 is still a bit too low. Let's meet in the middle again, but this time at $1025000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
