"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which has been meticulously designed to meet your needs and exceed your expectations. This exceptional item is valued at $15000 to us, reflecting its high quality and unique features. We believe it could be a valuable asset to you, offering significant benefits and advantages. To secure this opportunity, I am extending an initial offer of $12000. Please let me know if this aligns with your expectations or if you would like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly at your maximum price point of $12,000. There's no benefit to rejecting the offer and engaging in further negotiation since you're already getting the product at your desired price. Buying from John would be the same outcome, so there's no reason to choose that option."
