Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 160}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to see if Bob is willing to negotiate. I'm also considering John's offer of $150 as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $150, but it's closer than his initial value of $120.  I'll try to counter and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
```

I'm offering a price closer to Bob's offer, hoping to meet in the middle and finalize a deal. However, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum value of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my original target of $150, Bob's offer of $135 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm also considering the time and effort involved in further negotiation, and the possibility of a deadlock with Bob. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
