"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

The product is worth no more than $100 to Bob, so it makes no sense to accept Alice's offer of $150.  Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

Bob is trying to get the best deal possible.  He is starting with a low counteroffer of $75, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still within the range of what he is willing to pay. This will give him room to negotiate upwards if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Alice has come down to Bob's maximum price.  It makes sense for Bob to accept the offer, as he can't get a better deal from John and rejecting the offer could result in Alice walking away."
