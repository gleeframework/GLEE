Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $10,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $9,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for that price just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $11,000? It's still a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer. $10,500 is a good price, and it's better than selling to John for $10,000.  I'm happy with this outcome."
