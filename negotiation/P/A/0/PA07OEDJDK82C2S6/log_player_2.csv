"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset that will bring significant benefits to your business. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1,100,000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. Since Alice is offering $1,100,000, there is potential for a better deal. It's worth exploring counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep, but I believe the product's value is worth more than $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I think you'll find it's a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is still trying to save money and $1,000,000 is still a bit high.  It's worth seeing if he can get the price lower by countering again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,000,000, but I'm still looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, Bob, but $950,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll come down to $990,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to make a deal at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While Bob could continue negotiating, Alice has come down to a price that's very close to his target. Accepting this offer will save him a significant amount of money compared to buying from John, and it's likely he won't get a much better deal."
