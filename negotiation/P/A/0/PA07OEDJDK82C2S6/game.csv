"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset that will bring significant benefits to your business. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1,100,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep, but I believe the product's value is worth more than $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I think you'll find it's a great deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,000,000, but I'm still looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, Bob, but $950,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll come down to $990,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to make a deal at this point.",990000.0,Alice,5,
