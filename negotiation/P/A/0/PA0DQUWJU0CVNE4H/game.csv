"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm, but that price is a bit high for me.  I'm interested, but would be willing to pay closer to $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit far from your offered price of $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $10,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal.",10000.0,Alice,3,
