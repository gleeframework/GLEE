Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $920,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more to $935,000.  This is a significant value for you, and it's a price I can realistically accept.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 935000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $935000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get closer to $925000. Can you consider that?

While I'd like to keep pushing for a higher price, the risk of Bob walking away entirely is high.  I'm going to accept his offer of $925,000 to secure the sale."
