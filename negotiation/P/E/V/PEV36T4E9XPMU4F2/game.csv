"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,400,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  This price reflects its value to me while still allowing you to make a profit.  Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,350,000. This price still reflects the value of the product to me, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway.  While $1,350,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to offer $1,325,000.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1325000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for both of us. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,325,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,340,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product to me. What do you think?",1340000.0,Alice,5,
