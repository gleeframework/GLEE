"Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $1,200,000 for it. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000, which is still a fair price for both of us. This is my final offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully.",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value of your product, but I have a budget in mind. I can do $1,350,000.  This is a fair offer considering I could go with another seller. Let me know what you think.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,350,000 is still below my minimum price. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to accept $1,450,000. This price is fair to both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. I'm confident you'll agree this is a good opportunity.",1450000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $1,375,000 is still below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $1,425,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that I have other offers on the table. It's a great opportunity for you, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.",1425000.0,Alice,7,
