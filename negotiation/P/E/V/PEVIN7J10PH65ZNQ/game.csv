"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your suggestion, but I was hoping to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $95? I believe this would still provide a good value while staying within my financial limits.",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $95 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This would still be a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Alice,3,
