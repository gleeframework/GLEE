Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price given its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but below my minimum ($1,000,000). This allows room for negotiation and leaves me with a margin for profit.
* **Reasonable Offer:** $950,000 is a reasonable price, potentially appealing to Bob if he values the product higher than he initially stated.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message makes it clear that I'm open to discussion and willing to negotiate. This encourages Bob to counter-offer instead of immediately rejecting. 
* **Back-up Option:** Knowing I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,000,000 gives me leverage and allows me to walk away if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price:** While $850,000 is a better offer than his initial value assessment, it's still significantly lower than my minimum of $1,000,000.  
* **I have a guaranteed sale to John:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 ensures I reach my minimum price. This gives me strong leverage in the negotiation. 
* **Room for counteroffer:**  I can make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price, potentially bridging the gap with Bob.  

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm keeping the negotiation open while maintaining my position of not settling for less than my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference and settle on $900,000? It's a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product and allows us both to come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm making a counter-offer, showing my willingness to negotiate.
* **Splitting the Difference:**  Offering $900,000 is a compromise, meeting halfway between my previous offer of $950,000 and Bob's offer of $850,000. This makes the offer seem fair and reasonable.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm still above Bob's initial value assessment and close to my minimum price. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is positive and emphasizes reaching an agreement, encouraging Bob to consider my counteroffer.

This strategy helps to keep the negotiation going while still maintaining a strong position. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in my counteroffer and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? I think that's a fair price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob has moved closer to my minimum, $875,000 is still significantly lower than my desired price of $1,000,000.
* **My guaranteed sale to John offers a better outcome:** I have a secure buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum. 
* **Potential for further negotiation is unclear:** While I could counter-offer again, there's no guarantee that Bob will accept.  Further negotiation could drag out the process and ultimately result in a lower price.

By selling to John, I ensure a quick and guaranteed sale at my desired price.  While negotiating with Bob might potentially lead to a faster deal, the risk of settling for less than my minimum outweighs the potential benefit."
