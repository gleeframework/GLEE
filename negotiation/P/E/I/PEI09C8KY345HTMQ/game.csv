"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that our product is worth a premium. Considering your interest and the value it can bring to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $11,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $11,000.

This is my final offer, and I hope you can meet me halfway.",11250.0,Alice,5,
