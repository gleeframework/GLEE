# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you! After considering your interest, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that our product is worth a premium. Considering your interest and the value it can bring to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  He can get the product from John for $10,000, so any price higher than that is not ideal. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can attempt to negotiate a lower price closer to his target."
