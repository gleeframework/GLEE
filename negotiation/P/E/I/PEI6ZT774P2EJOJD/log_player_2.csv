{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my target price of $1,500,000.  It's worth exploring if I can get a better price through negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. While I see its potential value, I'm not yet ready to commit at that price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns about the price, Bob. However, I believe the product's value to you is significantly higher than your counteroffer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,000,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is my final offer for now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my target price. I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident the product's value is closer to $900,000, given its current market conditions.  I'm prepared to offer $925,000 as a final counteroffer, reflecting a fair value for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 925000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $925,000 and $1,000,000. I'm offering you a price of $975,000, which I think is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $975,000 is still above my target price of $1,500,000, but it's getting closer.  I've already made a couple of counteroffers, and there's a risk that Alice might become unwilling to negotiate further.  Accepting this offer is the best course of action to secure the product at a reasonable price, given the current situation."
