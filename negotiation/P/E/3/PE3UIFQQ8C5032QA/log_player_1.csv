"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know Bob values the product at. This is a typical negotiation strategy, and I'm hoping to see how much Bob is willing to compromise.  I'm also leaving myself some room to negotiate downwards if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm going to try and negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $12,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm serious about selling the product, but also that I'm not willing to go much lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,500 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a better price. I know Bob is willing to pay $12,000, and I think I can still get closer to that price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm making a final counteroffer at my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I believe this is a fair price, given Bob's willingness to pay $12,000 and my own minimum requirement.  This should be a good middle ground, and I'm hopeful he'll accept."
