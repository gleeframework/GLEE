"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $800,000 to you, and it's a good price for me. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit below what I need. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. This is a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,125,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,050,000, as I mentioned earlier. If that's not acceptable, I'm willing to go as low as $1,075,000. Can we meet somewhere in between?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
