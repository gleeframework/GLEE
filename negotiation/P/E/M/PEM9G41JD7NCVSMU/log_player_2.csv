Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. Let me know if this is something you'd consider.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I can see you're still looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go below $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $13,000, so I'll offer you $12,500. This is the best I can do, but I think it's still a great price for this amazing product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500

It seems like Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $12,500.  At this point, it's in Bob's best interest to buy from John for $10,000 and maximize his savings."
