"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it will bring you a lot of value and I'm willing to make a one-time offer just for you. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is below her product's value to her, you know you can get a better price from John ($1,000,000). Rejecting her offer opens the door for you to buy from John and save $200,000."
