"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think it's worth discussing a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to start with a price of $1100000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1100000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $950000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to secure the product while leaving you with a substantial profit.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $1025000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a good opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise. However, $1025000 is still a bit higher than I'm aiming for. I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial price. How about $1000000? This would allow me to secure the product and leave you with a good profit, as it's significantly higher than what another seller is offering me.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, so I'm counteroffering at $1012500. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a good opportunity for us to come to an agreement.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
