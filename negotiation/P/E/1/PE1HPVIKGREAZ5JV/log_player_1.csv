Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1100000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $950000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to secure the product while leaving you with a substantial profit.
