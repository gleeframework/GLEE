"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, potentially even more than my asking price. I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's initial offer is too high. While it's lower than John's price, there's room for negotiation to get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows us to start the counter-offer process."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is still a bit high for me.  I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $950,000 at this point.  This is a fair price considering your value and my budget.  I believe we can both benefit from this deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product to you is undeniable, and $950,000 significantly undervalues its potential.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's settle at $1,025,000. This reflects the product's worth while still providing you with a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above my ideal price point. I'm aiming for a price closer to $950,000, so there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting her offer allows me to counter again and hopefully find a mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,025,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $975,000.  This reflects a compromise from both of us and is a fair price that allows us to move forward.  Let's find a solution that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 975000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing your eagerness to close this deal, and I respect your approach. How about we land on $1,000,000?  This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my initial asking price while acknowledging the product's immense value to you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
