"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, potentially even more than my asking price. I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is still a bit high for me.  I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $950,000 at this point.  This is a fair price considering your value and my budget.  I believe we can both benefit from this deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product to you is undeniable, and $950,000 significantly undervalues its potential.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's settle at $1,025,000. This reflects the product's worth while still providing you with a great deal.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,025,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $975,000.  This reflects a compromise from both of us and is a fair price that allows us to move forward.  Let's find a solution that benefits us both.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing your eagerness to close this deal, and I respect your approach. How about we land on $1,000,000?  This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my initial asking price while acknowledging the product's immense value to you.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $985,000. This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while staying within my budget.  Let's work together to finalize this deal.",985000.0,Bob,6,
