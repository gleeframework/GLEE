Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is still a bit high for me.  I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $950,000 at this point.  This is a fair price considering your value and my budget.  I believe we can both benefit from this deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,025,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $975,000.  This reflects a compromise from both of us and is a fair price that allows us to move forward.  Let's find a solution that benefits us both.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $985,000. This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while staying within my budget.  Let's work together to finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could push for more, accepting at $985,000 is a strong deal. Bob is clearly feeling the pressure and unlikely to go much higher. This price is significantly above my minimum and secures a substantial profit. Holding out for more risks losing the deal entirely."
