Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and deliver significant returns."", ""product_price"": 2000000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Negotiations often benefit from starting with a strong initial offer. This leaves room for potential concessions while still aiming for a high final price. 
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** Bob's counteroffer will reveal how interested he truly is and how much he values the product.  
* **Alternative Option:**  Having John as a backup buyer provides a safety net.  If Bob's offers remain too low, Alice can always walk away and sell to John for her minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for this product.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Valuation:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is already above his perceived value of the product ($1,200,000). This suggests there's room for negotiation.
* **Below Minimum:** Accepting $1,400,000 is less than Alice's guaranteed $1,500,000 from John. It makes more sense to negotiate further or sell to John.
* **Strategic Counter-Offer:** By rejecting Bob's offer, Alice can propose a counter-offer closer to her desired price, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but the price you're offering doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that acknowledges its potential benefits."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Downward Movement:**  Alice is signaling flexibility by reducing her price, which encourages Bob to continue negotiating.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  The new price is still significantly above Bob's offer and slightly below Alice's initial offer, leaving room for further negotiation. 
* **Value Emphasis:**  Alice reiterates the product's value to justify the higher price, hoping to influence Bob's perception."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,800,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,400,000.  I believe this price accurately reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob is sticking to his $1,400,000 offer, showing little movement in his position.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Further negotiation with Bob carries the risk of a lower final price. Alice has a guaranteed offer of $1,500,000 from John.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John ensures Alice receives a price above her minimum and avoids the uncertainty of continued haggling with Bob."
