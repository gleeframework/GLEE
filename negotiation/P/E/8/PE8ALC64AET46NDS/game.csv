"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for this product.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but the price you're offering doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that acknowledges its potential benefits.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,800,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,400,000.  I believe this price accurately reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
