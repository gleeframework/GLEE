Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $135, which is above my minimum acceptable price of $120. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** $135 is below Bob's perceived value of $150, so he has an incentive to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** My message is friendly and focuses on the product's value to Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $135 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.**  While it's tempting to go for a quick sale, accepting his offer would leave me with less than I'm willing to accept.
* **There's room for counteroffers.**  I can still negotiate with Bob.  He's clearly interested, and I can try to meet somewhere in the middle. 
* **Selling to John is always an option.** If negotiations with Bob continue to stall, I can always choose to sell to John for $120. This ensures I don't lose out completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to work with you. However, $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $125? That would still leave some room for you to get a good deal, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's a compromise between my minimum acceptable price ($120) and Bob's initial offer ($110). This shows I'm willing to negotiate and suggests I'm serious about making a deal.
* **Highlight Mutual Benefits:** I emphasize that the proposed price still allows Bob to get a good deal, making it more appealing to him.
* **Maintain Friendly Tone:**  The message remains friendly and positive, keeping the negotiation atmosphere open."
