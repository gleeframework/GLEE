Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment. I'm offering it to you for $1,450,000. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  I don't actually know how much Bob values the product. Assuming he's acting rationally, he'll buy it for anything less than or equal to $800,000 and reject anything higher. 
* **Maximizing Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $1,500,000 (John's offer) as possible. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting with a slightly lower price than John's offer allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.

**Important:** There's a risk Bob will reject the offer, but since I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, I'm not losing anything by trying to secure a higher price first."
