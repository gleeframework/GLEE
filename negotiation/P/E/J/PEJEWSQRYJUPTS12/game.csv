"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $1,100,000, which is a significant discount from my original price. I'm confident you'll find it a fair price considering the value you place on the product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,100,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  This represents a good value for both of us. Let's see if we can close the deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum price. Let's see if we can seal the deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
