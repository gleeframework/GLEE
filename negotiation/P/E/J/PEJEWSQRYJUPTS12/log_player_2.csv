"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a strong opening offer of $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still significantly higher than the product's worth to her ($800,000).  There's room for negotiation to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to get a more favorable deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $1,100,000, which is a significant discount from my original price. I'm confident you'll find it a fair price considering the value you place on the product.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is better than her initial price, it's still higher than what Bob wants to pay.  There's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue to try and get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum price. Let's see if we can seal the deal.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000 and still leaves some room for Alice to make a profit.  While Bob could continue to negotiate, accepting this offer minimizes the risk of Alice walking away or Bob ending up paying more to John."
