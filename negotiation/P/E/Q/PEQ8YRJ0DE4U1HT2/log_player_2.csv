Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a good value for my product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $700,000. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you.

While $700,000 is better, we're still some distance apart. Let's see if we can negotiate further with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $600,000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $650,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and $650,000 is a reasonable price saving $350,000 from John's offer. It's time to accept the deal."
