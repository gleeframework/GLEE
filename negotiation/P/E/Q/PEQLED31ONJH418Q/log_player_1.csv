Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you would find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** You want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($120) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $100 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring you make a significant profit above your minimum ($80). 
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  Going in with an offer too close to $120 might make Bob feel like he's not getting a good deal and could lead to him rejecting the offer outright.

This strategy balances maximizing your potential profit while also increasing the likelihood of a successful sale to Bob."
