"I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",80.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,180.0
"I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $180, which is a significant discount from the original price. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",180.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $180 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm looking to save as much money as possible. Would you be willing to go down to $120?",120.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,160.0
"I can see you're really interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I can meet you halfway between $180 and $120, which is $150. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150, but I have another buyer interested in it, so I need to make a decision soon.",150.0,Alice,5,,

"I appreciate the offer, but $150 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $130, but no higher. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",130.0,Bob,6,,
