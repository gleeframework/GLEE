"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire [product name]. This product is worth at least $800000 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for a price that's mutually beneficial.  I'm confident you'll see the value in this product, and I believe a price of $950000 would be fair for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.  I'm available to discuss this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
