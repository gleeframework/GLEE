"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While $900,000 is certainly a respectable offer, the true value of this product is significantly higher. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This reflects its potential while acknowledging your initial offer.  What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
