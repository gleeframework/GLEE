"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a good deal, it's still above your maximum budget. You can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $1,075,000? Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down in price, but it's still a little higher than you're comfortable with.  There's room for further negotiation before you reach the price point where buying from John becomes the more attractive option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,075,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,060,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 1060000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,060,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway once more. How about $1,065,000?  This would be a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,065,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,065,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,065,000, which is only $65,000 over your maximum budget. While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and potentially asking for a higher price is high.  It's also worth noting that you've already had four rounds of negotiation, and time is running out. Accepting Alice's offer at this point is the most sensible choice to secure the product within your budget."
