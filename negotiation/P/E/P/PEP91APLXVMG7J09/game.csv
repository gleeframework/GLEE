"Bob, I understand that you're getting close to your maximum budget, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a price that's closer to my minimum value. I'm counteroffering at $16000, but I'll throw in a sweetener - I'll include a 1-year warranty on the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and its value to you, and the added warranty will give you extra peace of mind.",16000.0,Alice,9,
