"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be a valuable asset for you. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? This product really is worth it, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is still a little too high. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Bob,4,
