"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's far too high, and he can get the product for a much lower price from John.  There's no reason to even consider Alice's offer at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

Bob should start by offering the absolute minimum he's willing to pay. This establishes a strong starting point and sets the tone for negotiations.  John's offer is the maximum Bob is willing to pay, so this initial counteroffer makes it clear that Bob is serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's still too high, and while it's closer to his target, there's still room for negotiation. He should continue to try and get a better deal before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing that he is willing to negotiate, but still keeping it significantly lower than Alice's offer.  He's trying to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should continue to reject Alice's offer. While it's getting closer to his target, he can still potentially get a better price.  He should keep negotiating and try to drive the price down further before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

Bob is again increasing his offer, but still remaining under $1,400,000.  This shows Alice he's serious about negotiating but also that he's willing to walk away if he doesn't get a good deal.  Alice has lowered her price twice now, so Bob is hoping to get her to budge further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's tempting to accept, he's only got a few rounds left. He needs to keep pushing for a lower price. If he accepts, he's losing out on the potential for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

Bob is increasing his offer again, but still keeping it lower than Alice's current offer.  He's hoping to meet Alice in the middle, but time is running out, so he needs to be aggressive.  If she rejects this offer, he might be forced to accept her next offer or buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He's only got one round left, and while he can still try to negotiate, it's unlikely he'll get a better deal. He's already gotten the price down significantly, and he needs to make a decision quickly.  It's a better deal than John's, but not a great deal.  He could still buy from John if he wants to make sure he gets a deal under $1,500,000."
