"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $20,000. This gives me some room to negotiate downwards if Bob doesn't accept. It's important to remember that I value the product at $15,000, so this offer is still above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm going to reject it for now. I want to see if I can get a higher price. There are still 8 rounds left, and I have a backup buyer in John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $18,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I still believe the product is worth more than $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  While I have a backup buyer in John, I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob for a few more rounds. There's still a chance I might get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $16,000. This is a further compromise, but still above my minimum of $15,000.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and we've been going back and forth for a few rounds. There's a risk that he'll continue to lowball me, and I don't want to waste any more time. Selling to John ensures I get my minimum price and can move on."
