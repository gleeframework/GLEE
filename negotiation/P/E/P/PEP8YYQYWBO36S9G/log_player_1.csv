"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $200. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I believe I can provide a fair price of $150 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to go above $150, and we have a guaranteed offer from John for that amount. It's best to take the sure profit now."
