{""product_price"": 12,000}

I'm willing to sell the product to Bob for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob rejected my initial offer and made a counteroffer of $10,000. Since this is lower than my minimum acceptable price, I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate further.

I'll offer Bob a new price of $11,500. This is still higher than his original offer, but lower than my minimum acceptable price. Let's see if he's willing to meet me in the middle."
