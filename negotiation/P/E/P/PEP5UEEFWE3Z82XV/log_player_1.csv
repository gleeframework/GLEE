Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, $1,500,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 to start the negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,200,000 is still quite a bit more than I had in mind. I could potentially go up to $700,000, which I think is a fair offer considering the value I see in the product.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down further. However, I'm afraid $1,000,000 is still beyond what I can justify for this purchase.  To be completely frank, I have another offer for a similar product at a significantly lower price.  If you're able to come down closer to $800,000, I'm still interested. Otherwise, I'll need to consider my other option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob has finally reached his maximum valuation of the product. While it's tempting to push for more, Bob has indicated he has an alternative and might walk away. Accepting the $800,000 ensures a significant profit and avoids the risk of losing both Bob and John as potential buyers."
