"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $9,000 is a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,500. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know what you think!",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $8,500? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a decent profit. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $8,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8,200. I think this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to accept it.",8200.0,Bob,4,
