"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,800,000.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $1,600,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That last price is closer, but I still can't quite make it work. How about we split the difference again and settle at $1,350,000? That would be a fair compromise, don't you think?",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $1,350,000, but I need to get closer to my target. I can do $1,450,000, which is a compromise from my previous offer. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can agree on a price.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
