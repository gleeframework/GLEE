"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  While I'm interested in the product,  $20000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to consider $10000?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $10000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $17000, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $17000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13000.  Let's meet in the middle.",13000.0,Bob,4,
