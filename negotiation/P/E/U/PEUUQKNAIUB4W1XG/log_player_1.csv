Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. It's a fair compromise, considering the market value and your original asking price. Can you consider my offer?

```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer to get closer to $10,000, I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for $15,000.  $9,800 is a good compromise, and I'm confident I can make up the difference with another sale."
