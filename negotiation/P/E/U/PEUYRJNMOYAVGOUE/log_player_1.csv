"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $10,000.  This gives us room to negotiate, and also establishes my firm belief in the product's value.  I'm confident that Bob will counteroffer, allowing us to work towards a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum of $15,000.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap.  There's still a lot of negotiation room, and I don't want to settle too quickly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $16,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. It's also closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair offer and be willing to meet us in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable accepting it.  I'm confident that I can get a better deal, and I'm willing to keep negotiating. I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not desperate to close this deal at any price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000} 
```

This is my final offer.  It's my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not willing to go any lower.  I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm serious about getting a fair price and accept my offer.  If he doesn't, I'll be happy to sell the product to John for $15,000."
