"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is significantly below what I need to get for the product. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price.  How about $120?  That would be a good deal for both of us.",120.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet you at $120. Could we possibly discuss a price closer to my maximum of $80?",80.0,Bob,4,
