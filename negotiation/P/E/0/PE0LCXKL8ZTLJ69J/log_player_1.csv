Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, I want to see if Bob will pay a price closer to that.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering it slightly below my guaranteed price might entice Bob while still securing a significant profit.
* **Appear Reasonable:**  Starting too high might scare Bob off. This offer balances a good profit with a price that might seem reasonable to him."
