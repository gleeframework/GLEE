"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to find a price closer to my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate down to $130?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $130 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140.  This is still a great price for this product, and it leaves some room for both of us to be happy. What do you say?",140.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the flexibility. I would like to counter with $135. I believe this price is fair for both of us.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $135 is still a little too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $142.50. This would allow me to make a decent profit and I believe it's a fair price for this quality product.  What do you think?",142.5,Alice,5,
