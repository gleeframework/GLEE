{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $145. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum acceptable price:** You've stated that the product is worth no less than $150 to you, so $145 is a good starting point.
* **It's below John's offer:** This gives you some room to negotiate with Bob without losing out on a guaranteed sale. 
* **It's close to Bob's perceived value:** $145 is only $25 more than what Bob thinks the product is worth. This makes it more likely that he'll be willing to accept the offer.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your potential earnings and securing a deal quickly. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to find a price closer to my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate down to $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $130 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140.  This is still a great price for this product, and it leaves some room for both of us to be happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:** It demonstrates that you're willing to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Is still above your minimum:** $140 is above your $150 minimum, so you're not losing money.
* **Is closer to Bob's offer:**  It's halfway between your previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing a willingness to compromise. 

Hopefully, Bob will find this counteroffer more appealing and we can close the deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the flexibility. I would like to counter with $135. I believe this price is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $135 is closer to my target price, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try one more time to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $135 is still a little too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $142.50. This would allow me to make a decent profit and I believe it's a fair price for this quality product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 142.50}
```

This counteroffer is:

* **Above your minimum:** It's still above your $150 minimum, so you're not losing money.
* **A compromise:** It's a compromise between your previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing continued willingness to negotiate.
* **A potential closing offer:** It's close enough to Bob's perceived value that it might be his final offer.

Let's see if Bob accepts this offer!"
