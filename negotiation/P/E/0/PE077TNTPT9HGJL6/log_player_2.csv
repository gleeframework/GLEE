"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, as I know it would be valuable to you. I'm willing to part with it for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Value to you:** The product is worth $150 to you.
* **Alice's price:** Alice is offering it for $120.
* **John's price:** John is selling it for $150.

By accepting Alice's offer, you save $30 compared to buying from John. Even though you could potentially negotiate further with Alice, the $120 price is still within your budget and offers a significant saving."
