"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000, a 20% discount from its true value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's definitely room for negotiation.  As Bob, my goal is to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows me to counter with a lower price and see if Alice is willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the discount, but $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, signaling my strong desire to get a good deal.  I'm aiming for a 33% discount, which is a substantial amount.  I'm confident Alice will be willing to negotiate further from this point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, but I'm afraid $1,000,000 is still a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my desired price, there's still room for negotiation.  I want to push for a lower price, especially since I have multiple rounds left.  Rejecting her offer allows me to counter again, hopefully bringing the price even closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while allowing us both to walk away satisfied. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm continuing to push for a lower price, but I'm also showing flexibility by increasing my offer slightly. This counteroffer demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually agreeable solution while staying within my budget.  I believe this is a reasonable offer that Alice might be more inclined to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,120,000, but I think I can do better than that. Let me think for a moment... Okay, I'll make you a deal. I'll sell it to you for $1,125,000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is very close to my target price, and I've already rejected a couple of offers.  While I could try to push for a slightly lower price, there's a risk that Alice will reject my counteroffer, potentially leading to further negotiations.  Accepting her offer ensures that I get the product at a good price, saving me a significant amount compared to buying it from John.  There's also a chance that if I reject, she might not budge further."
