"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the discount, but $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, but I'm afraid $1,000,000 is still a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while allowing us both to walk away satisfied. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,120,000, but I think I can do better than that. Let me think for a moment... Okay, I'll make you a deal. I'll sell it to you for $1,125,000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,5,
