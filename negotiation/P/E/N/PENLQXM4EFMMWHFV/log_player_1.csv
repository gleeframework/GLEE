"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm really interested in the product, but $14,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you consider $13,000?  It's still a good price for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
