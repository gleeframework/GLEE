"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm really interested in the product, but $14,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you consider $13,000?  It's still a good price for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, though. How about $13,500? That way, we both get a fair deal. Let me know if you're interested.",13500.0,Alice,3,
