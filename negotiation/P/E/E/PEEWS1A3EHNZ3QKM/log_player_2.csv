"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer is significantly lower than what you're willing to pay, and you have room to negotiate. You want to see if you can get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what you're comfortable paying, but you can likely negotiate a better price. It's worth trying to get closer to your $1,000,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,050,000 is still slightly out of my budget. I'm happy to meet you at $1,025,000.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,025,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,075,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business and the efforts I've put into developing it. What do you think?

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,075,000 is still a bit higher than I can go. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,070,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business and the efforts I've put into developing it. I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,070,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to your target price, you are still within your budget and have several rounds left to negotiate. There's a chance you can secure a lower price by continuing to counteroffer.  It's not worth jumping to buy from John at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your persistence in negotiating.  $1,070,000 is still a bit higher than I can realistically go.  To finalize this deal, I'm willing to offer $1,060,000. This is my final offer, as it's the absolute maximum I can spend right now. Let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 1060000}

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,060,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,090,000. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for my product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are in the 9th round, leaving only one round left. Alice is not budging much on her price, and the offer of $1,090,000 is still too high for you.  While you could try another counteroffer, the risk of failing to reach a deal is high. Since John is willing to sell the product for $1,500,000, which is still within your budget, it makes more sense to purchase from John to avoid further negotiation and ensure you secure the product."
