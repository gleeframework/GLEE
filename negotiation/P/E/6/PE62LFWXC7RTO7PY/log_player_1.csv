"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling a valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you.  I'm offering it to you first at a price of $1,800,000. This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident you'll find the value aligns with the price. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm opening with a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value ($1,200,000). This allows room for negotiation and gives me a better chance of achieving a higher final price.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm framing the product as valuable and potentially of ""great interest"" to Bob to pique his curiosity and encourage him to consider the offer. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** The message explicitly acknowledges that the price is negotiable and that I'm open to hearing Bob's thoughts. 
* **Limited Rounds:** I'm aware of the 10 round limit, so I need to start with a strong offer to maximize potential profit within the time constraint."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product might be high, but given my budget constraints, I am looking for a more reasonable price. Would you consider reducing the price to $1500000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,500,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my desired minimum of $1,200,000.  I have 8 rounds left, so I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price. I'll likely counter with a price slightly below my initial offer to signal my willingness to negotiate, but still within my acceptable range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While I value the product at a higher price, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's meet in the middle. How about $1,650,000?  This price reflects the value I'm placing on the product while acknowledging your financial considerations. I'm open to further discussions to find a mutually beneficial solution."", ""product_price"": 1650000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Show Flexibility:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's concerns about the price and expressing my willingness to be flexible.
* **Counteroffer Within Range:** The counteroffer of $1,650,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. This allows for further negotiation while leaving room for profit.
* **Maintain Value:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product and suggesting that $1,650,000 is a fair price that reflects its worth. 
* **Mutual Benefit:**  I'm framing the negotiation as a search for a ""mutually beneficial solution,"" implying that both of us can win in this deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Given my current budget, I would like to propose a price of $1550000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and our financial considerations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still have several rounds remaining and there's a chance to get closer to my desired price. I'll continue to negotiate, aiming for a price closer to $1,650,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and your offer is getting closer to what I'm aiming for.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This offer reflects a significant compromise on my end, but I'm confident it's still a good deal for both of us.  Let's finalize this transaction and make it mutually beneficial."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Showing Compromise:**  I'm explicitly stating that my counteroffer is a compromise to demonstrate my flexibility. 
* **Bridge the Gap:** I'm using language like ""bridge the gap"" to highlight that we're getting closer to an agreement.
* **Mutual Benefit Again:**  The emphasis on ""mutual benefit"" reinforces the idea that we can both come out ahead in this deal.

By this point, we've gone back and forth a few times, and this counteroffer shows my willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price that's closer to my desired range. It's time to see if Bob will finally accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. I appreciate the effort to reach a compromise. Based on our previous discussions, I would like to propose a final offer of $1575000. I hope this price is acceptable and allows us to move forward with the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,575,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,575,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,575,000 is getting closer, it's still below my desired minimum of $1,200,000. I have 4 rounds remaining, and there's still a chance to negotiate a better price. I'll continue to push for a higher price, even though the potential for a deal with Bob is getting tighter."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective and your offer is getting closer to what I'm looking for. However, I still need to consider the value of this product.  To move forward, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,587,500.  This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.  Let's wrap up this deal and avoid any further delays."", ""product_price"": 1587500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This language emphasizes my willingness to compromise to reach a deal. It also suggests that Bob's offer is almost acceptable, but I still need a slight adjustment.
* **Fair Compromise:** This reinforces the notion that the counteroffer is reasonable and reflects a shared effort to find common ground.
* **Finality and urgency:**  I'm now emphasizing the need for a final decision to avoid further delays and push Bob towards a quick acceptance. 

We've already rejected several offers, and this counteroffer is a final attempt to reach a deal with Bob.  If this is rejected, I might need to start considering John's offer as we're running out of rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your continued willingness to negotiate. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. Based on our discussions, I would like to propose a final offer of $1578750. I hope this proposal is within your consideration range and allows us to conclude this transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,578,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,578,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We're down to the wire with only 2 rounds remaining.  While Bob's offer of $1,578,750 is getting closer to my desired range, it's still not enough.  Furthermore, I've already rejected several offers and there's no guarantee that Bob will accept my counteroffer in the next round.  

To secure a sale and avoid the risk of completely losing the deal, it's best to accept John's offer.  While it's less than I initially hoped for, it's still above my minimum acceptable price and ensures a guaranteed sale.  The risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price, given the limited time and uncertainty."
