Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $100 to me, but I understand its value may be different to you. Let's start with a fair price. How about $95?"", ""product_price"": 95}"

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
