Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1100000} 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also positions me to potentially get closer to my desired price, while still maintaining a reasonable chance of Bob accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $950,000 is a good price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'll counter-offer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering a price of $1,050,000. This is a compromise that still leaves me some room to negotiate, while also demonstrating that I'm willing to work with Bob to find a solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. While I'm willing to negotiate with Bob, his counteroffers are getting too low and are not meeting my minimum acceptable price. Selling to John guarantees me my desired price and eliminates the risk of further negotiation."
