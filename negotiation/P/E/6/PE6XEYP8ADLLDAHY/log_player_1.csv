{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal considering its value to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a good balance between maximizing my profit and leaving room for negotiation.  It's also important to be friendly and encouraging to keep Bob engaged.  

I'll be ready to adjust my price based on Bob's response, or walk away and sell to John if the negotiation stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is better than his initial rejection, it's still significantly lower than my desired price.  I need to see if I can push for a better deal. 

I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $10500 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $9500. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would love to get closer to my desired price, Bob's offer of $9,500 is getting closer to a reasonable deal for me. It's still higher than his initial offer, and I'm concerned that if I reject it, he might become less interested or walk away completely. Accepting this offer is the best way to ensure I sell the product and secure a profit."
