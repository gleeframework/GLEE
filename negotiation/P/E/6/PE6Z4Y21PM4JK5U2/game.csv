"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a valuable opportunity and I believe it could be a game-changer for your business. My initial price is $1,200,000,  which is a significant discount from its true worth.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me at the moment. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However, $600,000 is significantly below what the product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $900,000 to demonstrate my commitment to this deal. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while offering you a significant value.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?  That feels like a fair deal for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the value this product brings, I'm willing to go down to $850,000 as a final compromise.  Let's not let this opportunity slip away.",850000.0,Alice,5,
