"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price just below the midpoint between our values. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, but also ensures I'm getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate your effort, but I am only willing to pay up to $120 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum value. While I can sell to John for that price, I'd prefer to try and negotiate with Bob further.  I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price of $140."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130.  This still gives you a great deal, and it's a fair price for me.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer that is halfway between Bob's offer and my previous offer. I'm hoping this will be a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've given this some thought and I'm still not comfortable going above $120. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I believe $120 is a fair price for both of us. Thank you for understanding. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is firm on his $120 offer, and I've already lowered my price.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price, I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether.  Selling to John for $120 guarantees me a sale and covers my minimum value."
