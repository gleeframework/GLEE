"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is $4,000 above your maximum budget. While the product is worth $8,000 to you, it's still a significant overpayment.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit steep for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, which is still a good price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the initial one, it's still $2,500 higher than your maximum budget. There's still room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer is the best strategy to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm prepared to offer $9,000 for the product, which is a fair price that reflects its value to me and gives you a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand your desire to get the best deal, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,000. Considering the product's worth to me is $15,000, I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and gives me a decent profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down on her price, $11,000 is still more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm still within my budget, and there are more rounds to negotiate. I'll make another counteroffer and see if we can close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
