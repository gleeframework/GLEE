"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit steep for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, which is still a good price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $8,000.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm prepared to offer $9,000 for the product, which is a fair price that reflects its value to me and gives you a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand your desire to get the best deal, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,000. Considering the product's worth to me is $15,000, I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and gives me a decent profit.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,6,
