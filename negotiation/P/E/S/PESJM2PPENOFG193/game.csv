"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
