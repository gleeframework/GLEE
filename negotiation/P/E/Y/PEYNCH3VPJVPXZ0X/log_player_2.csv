# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to invest in something that will bring you great value.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $800,000 is a significant compromise for you, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, considering the product's value and the original price I had in mind, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $900,000.  Since you can get the product for $800,000 from John, it makes the most financial sense to buy from John and save the extra $100,000."
