Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking $20,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000} 
 
**Reasoning:**  Starting with a high initial offer gives you room to negotiate downwards and still stay above your minimum acceptable price. This strategy also helps you gauge Bob's interest level.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product. However, I am only able to offer $15,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** Bob offered $15,000, which matches my minimum acceptable price. However, there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject his offer and propose a counteroffer slightly lower than my initial price to see if I can get closer to $17,000 or $18,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm looking for something closer to $18,000 for this product. It really is top-of-the-line. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm coming down from my initial price but still aiming high.  By highlighting the product's value again, I'm hoping to justify the higher price and encourage Bob to meet me closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I'm willing to go up to $16,000 for this product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has increased his offer to $16,000. While this is still less than my ideal price, it's a reasonable amount above my minimum. Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the sale entirely. It's better to secure a good profit now than hold out for a potentially slightly higher price and risk getting only $15,000 from John."
