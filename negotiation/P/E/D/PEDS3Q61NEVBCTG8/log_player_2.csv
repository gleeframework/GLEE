"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $950,000 is better than John's offer of $1,000,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to be aggressive in the first counteroffer.  $850,000 is a significant drop from Alice's offer, but it's still a good deal for both parties.  The goal is to test Alice's willingness to negotiate and see if she's willing to compromise. If she rejects, Bob can adjust his counteroffer in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $975,000 is a little higher than her initial offer, but it's still within Bob's budget. However, Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. Rejecting this offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise. However, he's still significantly lower than Alice's offer, hoping to find a middle ground that benefits both parties. This move also allows Bob to gauge Alice's willingness to meet halfway, as he has already shown flexibility in his offers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $960,000 is a slight decrease from her previous offer.  While it's closer to Bob's budget than John's price, Bob is still trying to save money and believes he can secure a better price with continued negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially close the deal at a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now increasing his counteroffer again, showing Alice that he's willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. This offer is a compromise between Alice's last offer and Bob's previous one, demonstrating a willingness to meet halfway. This strategy aims to persuade Alice to accept the offer and finalize the deal within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $955,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $955,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $955,000 is now within Bob's budget, and it's also a better deal than buying from John for $1,000,000. There are only a few rounds left, and further negotiation might risk losing the deal with Alice altogether.  It's time to accept and finalize the purchase."
