Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1400000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1650000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, but her offer is still above Bob's ideal price. Since Bob has the option to buy from John for a guaranteed $1,500,000, it's the safer and more cost-effective option. Further negotiation with Alice risks exceeding Bob's budget or wasting valuable time."
