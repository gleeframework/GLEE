"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1800000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product, as I believe that's a fair price considering my budget. What do you think?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1400000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the middle ground. How about $1600000? It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1600000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $1550000 for the product, which is a significant amount and demonstrates my genuine interest. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
