Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Justification:**  While not revealing the minimum price, the message hints at the product's value, making the higher price seem more reasonable.
* **Alternative:** By mentioning listing the product publicly, Alice subtly reminds Bob that he might lose the opportunity to a competitor. 

This approach aims to maximize profit while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation. If Bob rejects this initial offer, Alice can always lower the price, knowing her minimum ($12,000) is secure with John."
