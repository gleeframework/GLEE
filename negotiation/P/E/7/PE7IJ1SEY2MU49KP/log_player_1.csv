Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $150 is a good starting point. It's above my minimum of $120, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Enthusiastic tone:**  Using a positive tone and emphasizing the value of the product might encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm not setting a hard limit, so Bob knows there's room for discussion. 

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it, make a counter-offer, or simply sell to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not in a rush to sell. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price of $150. I'll counteroffer to test the waters and see if there's room for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $120 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit to $135. This still gives me some wiggle room, and I think it's a fair price for the value this product offers. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $135, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. 
* **Justification:** I provide a reason for the counteroffer (""still gives me some wiggle room"") to show Bob that I'm being reasonable.
* **Emphasis on value:** I reiterate the product's value to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $135, but I'm still a bit too high on the budget. I'd be willing to pay $125 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $125 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum of $120, and I'm not sure I can get a higher price with further negotiation.  While selling to John for $120 is a guaranteed option,  $125 is a better deal. Accepting Bob's offer maximizes my earnings in this situation."
