# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

I'm going to reject Alice's offer. While it's tempting, I can get the product for less from John. I'll try to negotiate a lower price with Alice first, but if that fails, I'll go with John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $850,000 is a fair price for you, but I'm still looking to get closer to the value I place on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the value I'm getting from the sale. What do you think?

Alice's offer of $875,000 is within my budget and represents a significant savings compared to her initial offer. It's still a better deal than buying from John. I'll accept it."
