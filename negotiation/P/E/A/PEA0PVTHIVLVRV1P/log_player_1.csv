Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you offering the product, but $1,500,000 is a bit too high for me. Given my budget and the value I place on the product, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
