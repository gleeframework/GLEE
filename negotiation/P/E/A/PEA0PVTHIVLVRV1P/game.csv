,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you offering the product, but $1,500,000 is a bit too high for me. Given my budget and the value I place on the product, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,000,000 undervalues it considerably. I could consider coming down to $1,350,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing some frustration on both sides, and I want to find a resolution that works for us both.  While I'm confident in the $1,350,000 valuation, I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000 as a final offer. This represents a significant concession on my part and I believe it's more than fair.

,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. However, $1,275,000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  Let's see if we can finalize a deal that's mutually beneficial.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
