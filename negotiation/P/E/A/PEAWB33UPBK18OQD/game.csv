"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am currently working within a budget of $800,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to this amount?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $800,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $850,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle at $875,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this transaction.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. While $875,000 is closer to my budget, I still believe we can find a mutually beneficial solution. Could we perhaps aim for $860,000? This would allow me to stay within my financial constraints while still acknowledging the value of your product.",860000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $860,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $865,000? This price reflects the value of my product while allowing you to stay within your budget. Let's make this deal happen!",865000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence in finding a middle ground. However, given my current financial situation, I'm unable to move past $860,000. Would it be possible for us to settle at this amount? I believe this would be a fair compromise that respects both our needs.",860000.0,Bob,6,
