Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in your product, $500000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it.  This is a fair price that reflects the potential value it can bring to my business.  Let's discuss further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

We hope this aligns better with your expectations and brings us closer to closing this deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}"

I'm willing to go up to $1000000 for this product.  I believe this represents a fair price that acknowledges the value we both see in it.  Let's find a way to close this deal that benefits both of us.
