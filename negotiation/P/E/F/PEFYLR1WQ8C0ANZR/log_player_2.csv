"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $18,000 is far above his budget.  He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I really appreciate you considering me. However, $18,000 is out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should still reject the offer.  While it's closer to his price range, $14,000 is still too high. He should try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $14,000, but I'm still not there. I can do $12,000, which is a good compromise for both of us. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $13,500. That's the best I can do for now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. While $13,500 is closer to his budget, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. He should use the knowledge that Alice is willing to drop her price to try to get closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, and I'm willing to pay more than my initial offer.  How about $12,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I think we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go any higher than $13,500, Bob. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a free maintenance package worth $1,000. That brings the total value to $14,500. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  While the free maintenance package is appealing, Alice is still unwilling to go below $13,500, which is still too high for Bob. With only a few rounds left, it's not likely that Alice will budge enough to make it worth it for Bob to keep negotiating. John's offer is the best option for Bob to get the product within his budget."
