"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product.  I think it would be incredibly beneficial for you. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's important to bring the price down significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $20,000 is significantly above my budget for this product. I'd be interested in purchasing it for $9,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:** Starting with a significantly lower counter-offer ($9,000) helps establish a lower price range right away. This leaves room for negotiation while staying under my $8,000 target.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message acknowledges Alice's offer but clearly states my price limit. This sets a firm tone for the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. While $20,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice came down a bit, but $17,000 is still significantly higher than my target price and the $8,000 I can get it for from John.  I need to continue negotiating to see if she's willing to move closer to my range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $17,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Could you consider a price closer to $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** While still a significant jump from my last offer,  I'm moving closer to a potential compromise point.  This signals that I'm willing to negotiate but not at any cost. 
* **Open-Ended Question:**  By asking ""Could you consider..."", I'm giving Alice the opportunity to counter-propose without me having to commit to a specific number just yet. This keeps the negotiation flexible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  This product is worth a considerable investment. How about we settle at $14,000? This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but $14,000 is still too far from my $8,000 fallback option.  I need to counter with a price that's closer to my range to see if there's any real possibility of reaching a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but there's still a gap.  I'm willing to stretch my budget to $11,000, but that's really the absolute maximum I can justify.  Do you think we can make something work around that figure?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Conciliatory:**  I'm acknowledging that we are making progress, but also clearly stating my maximum.  This sets a firm boundary while still showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""stretching my budget,"" I'm subtly reminding Alice that I have a hard limit.
* **Open to a Deal:**  The phrasing ""make something work around that figure"" leaves room for Alice to counter with a price slightly above $11,000, while still keeping the negotiation focused on my target range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. It seems we're nearing a point where we need to make a decision. I'm willing to accept a final offer of $12,500. This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to close this deal. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is presenting this as her ""final offer"" and while closer, $12,500 is still significantly more than the $8,000 I can get the product for from John.  It's unlikely Alice will move much closer to my price range, so it's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed lower price."
