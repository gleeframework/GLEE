"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product.  I think it would be incredibly beneficial for you. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000.  What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $20,000 is significantly above my budget for this product. I'd be interested in purchasing it for $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. While $20,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $17,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Could you consider a price closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  This product is worth a considerable investment. How about we settle at $14,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but there's still a gap.  I'm willing to stretch my budget to $11,000, but that's really the absolute maximum I can justify.  Do you think we can make something work around that figure?",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. It seems we're nearing a point where we need to make a decision. I'm willing to accept a final offer of $12,500. This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to close this deal. Let me know your thoughts.",12500.0,Alice,7,
