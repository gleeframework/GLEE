"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's in great condition and worth a lot to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's close to my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay closer to my value.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,500 is above my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my ideal price point. I'm going to counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a compromise closer to the middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250?  I'm really hoping to make this deal work, so let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we do $13,000? I really think that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

$13,000 is a good price for me. It's close to my ideal price point, and I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob by being too stubborn. I'm confident that I can find another buyer for $12,000 if necessary, but I'd rather close this deal now."
