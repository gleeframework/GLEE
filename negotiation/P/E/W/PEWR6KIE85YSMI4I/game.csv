"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it has the potential to bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to make a starting offer of $900000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. Can you meet me at that price?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $700000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss $850000? This is a more competitive price that still reflects the value of the product.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $850000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $750000. Can you meet me at that price?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, $750000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. How about we discuss $825000? This is a price that's closer to my minimum, but still competitive for you.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $825000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $775000. Can you meet me at that price?",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but $775000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm starting to get concerned that we might not meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we discuss $810000? This is a price that's still a compromise, but it's getting closer to where I need to be.",810000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're getting closer to your minimum price, Alice, but I'm still trying to find a sweet spot. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $775000 and $810000. How about we discuss $792500? This is a compromise that I think we can both live with.",792500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $792500 is still a bit short of my target. I'm not willing to go below $825000, and I'm starting to think that we're getting close to the end of the road. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we discuss $820000? This is a price that's still a compromise, but it's getting closer to where I need to be.",820000.0,Alice,9,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm starting to think that we're getting close to the end of the road. I'm willing to make one final offer. I'll meet you at $815000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finally come to an agreement.",815000.0,Bob,10,
