Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a valuable product that I believe would be highly beneficial to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I think this is a fair offer considering its worth."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,400,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a bit, but still secures a significant profit for you.
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000 to John provides a safety net. You don't want to go below this price.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit from Bob while still ensuring the product is sold at a price significantly above your minimum."
