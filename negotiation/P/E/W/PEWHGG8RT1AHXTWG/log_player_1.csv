{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $100. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $100 is higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but it's still a decent discount from your minimum price.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  If Bob rejects, you can still negotiate down a bit without dipping below your minimum.
* **It shows you're willing to compromise:**  It signals to Bob that you're open to finding a deal. 

Let me know if you want me to generate a counteroffer based on Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the suggestion, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still not happy with it.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $90 just doesn't work for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $95?  It's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
 
This counteroffer is a compromise:

* **It's above Bob's offer:** It shows you're willing to negotiate, but not cave to his initial price.
* **It's below your ideal price:** It keeps you in the game, but also allows for further negotiation if Bob rejects.
* **It's a reasonable middle ground:** This is likely to feel like a fair offer for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I am still seeking to keep my expenses lower. Could we perhaps agree on $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob is insistent on $90, and I don't want to risk further negotiation.  John is willing to pay my minimum price, so it's a guaranteed sale."
