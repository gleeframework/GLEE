# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you. It's an exceptional item that has been meticulously crafted to meet your high standards. Given its value and quality, we believe it's worth $15,000 to you. To make this opportunity more appealing, I am offering it to you at a special introductory price of $12,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its true worth, and I hope you'll find it irresistible. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing further details or if you have any questions. Looking forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is lower than John's $15,000, it's still significantly higher than Alice's own valuation of $8,000. This suggests there's room for negotiation. By rejecting this initial offer,  Bob might be able to get Alice to lower the price further."
