# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique and valuable product. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $12,000 is above his budget.  He can try to negotiate with Alice or buy from John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, which is a fair price considering my maximum budget. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $12000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10500. This is the lowest price I can consider, and I think it's still a great deal for you. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, it's still above his $8,000 limit. He has two options: 

1.  **Counteroffer:**  Bob can try to negotiate further with Alice, aiming for a price closer to his maximum.
2.  **Buy from John:** Bob can purchase the product from John for $8,000, ensuring he stays within his budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,500 is still beyond my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $9,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects its value. Let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10000. This is the lowest price I can consider, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000. Alice's offer of $10,000 is still above Bob's budget.  He has already made multiple counteroffers and Alice has shown a reluctance to go lower. It's likely further negotiation with Alice won't lead to a price within his budget. Buying from John guarantees Bob the product at his maximum price limit."
