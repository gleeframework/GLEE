"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premium product, which holds immense value for you at $1000000. I am offering you the opportunity to acquire this exceptional item at a special price of $950000. This is an exclusive offer tailored to recognize your interest and commitment. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer. Sincerely, Alice. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still higher than the product's value to Bob ($1,000,000). 

By rejecting the offer, Bob can force Alice to lower her price or risk losing the sale entirely.  It's in Alice's best interest to negotiate further since she'd rather sell to Bob for a profit than lose the deal and get nothing."
