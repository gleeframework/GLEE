"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this truly unique product.  Given its exceptional value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its worth, but I'm open to discussing further."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with an offer significantly higher than both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows me to secure a price well above $1,000,000.
* **Confident Tone:** The message emphasizes the product's value to create a sense of desirability. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** While the initial price is high, I want to signal that I'm willing to negotiate, encouraging Bob to engage in the process.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while leaving room to maneuver in the subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the opportunity, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good offer, I still believe there's room for negotiation. Bob's counteroffer suggests he's serious about purchasing the product. I'm willing to engage in further rounds to try and secure a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. To meet you closer to your range, I'm proposing $1,400,000."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm making a significant concession from my initial offer to demonstrate willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still aiming for a price considerably above both our minimums.
* **Justification:**  I'm not simply throwing out numbers. By reiterating my confidence in finding a mutually beneficial price, I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's value.
* **Maintaining Momentum:** By quickly countering, I keep the negotiation moving forward, signaling my interest in closing the deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm glad you're willing to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** Accepting Bob's offer at $1,300,000 yields a significant profit of $300,000 above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has consistently increased his offer, indicating his strong interest in the product. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could potentially push for a slightly higher price, there's always the risk that Bob might walk away or that further negotiations could stall. Accepting now secures a substantial profit."
