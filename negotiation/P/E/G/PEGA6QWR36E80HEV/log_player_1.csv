Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
