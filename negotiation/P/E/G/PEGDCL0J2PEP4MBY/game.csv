"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $13500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for such a great product.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I really need to make a profit on this sale. I can do $13000, and that's as low as I can go. I think it's a fair price, considering the product's value and what I've already offered you.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting a bit concerned that we're not meeting in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I really need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $13250. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.",13250.0,Alice,7,

"I've already given you a significant discount, Bob, and I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet on the price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $13500 is too low, so I will offer it to you for $14000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",14000.0,Alice,9,
