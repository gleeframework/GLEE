Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I respect your position and will consider it carefully. To reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I propose a final offer of $710,000 for the product. This price is a compromise that takes into account both our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $710,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $710,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This price is a reasonable compromise and saves a significant amount compared to John's offer. It's unlikely Alice will go lower, and we risk pushing her too far by continuing to negotiate."
