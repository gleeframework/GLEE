"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim High:** Starting with a price significantly higher than your minimum ($800,000) and Bob's perceived value leaves room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message emphasizes the product's value, justifying the high initial price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** By calling it a ""starting price,"" you signal your willingness to negotiate.

This strategy aims to anchor the negotiation at a higher point, giving you leverage as the rounds progress."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price seems a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $600,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($800,000) and his own perceived value of the product. Accepting this offer would mean a substantial loss for you. It's highly likely that there is room for negotiation, and you can work towards a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $600,000 is significantly below its market value and what I'm willing to accept. I'm open to negotiation but need to see a price that reflects the true value of this product. Would you consider $900,000?"", 
""product_price"": 900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** While acknowledging Bob's offer, the message firmly reiterates that $600,000 is unacceptable.
* **Justification:** Mentioning ""market value"" strengthens your position and implies that your price isn't arbitrary. 
* **Significant Step Down:**  Moving from $1,000,000 to $900,000 shows a willingness to negotiate but maintains a strong stance above your minimum.
* **Open Question:** Ending with a question encourages Bob to re-engage and propose a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget in mind.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now getting closer to your minimum price, but $750,000 is still below your $800,000 threshold.  You're in a strong position to hold firm for one more round and see if you can bridge that remaining gap.  The risk of losing the deal by rejecting this offer is relatively low, as Bob has shown genuine interest and is moving closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $750,000 is still below what I can accept.  How about we settle at $825,000? This reflects the product's value while acknowledging your budget constraints."",
""product_price"": 825000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory Tone:**  Acknowledging Bob's effort to find a compromise helps maintain a positive negotiation atmosphere.
* **Small Concession:**  Coming down by $75,000 shows flexibility while still aiming for a price above your minimum.
* **Framing the Offer:** Presenting $825,000 as a solution that addresses both sides' needs increases the likelihood of acceptance.
* **Sense of Urgency:** With each round, you're getting closer to the point where accepting John's offer might be the better option. A slightly firmer stance in this round can encourage Bob to make a decision."
