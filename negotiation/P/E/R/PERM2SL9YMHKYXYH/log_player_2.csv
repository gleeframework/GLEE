"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable.  I'm offering it to you for $145. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is pretty close to your maximum budget. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! That's a bit steep for me though. Would you consider $110?"",
 ""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a price significantly lower than Alice's offer. This leaves space for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Polite and Positive:**  Maintaining a friendly tone is important for a smooth negotiation. I'm acknowledging Alice's offer and expressing interest while still being firm about my price.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  By aiming low, I'm trying to influence Alice's perception of my willingness to pay.  She might be more likely to accept a counteroffer closer to my actual budget if she thinks I'm starting from a lower point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $110 is a bit too low for me.  Would you consider $135? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to your desired price range, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open and allows you to push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $125?"",
 ""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm proposing a price that's directly in between our last two offers. This is a common negotiation tactic that can signal fairness and willingness to compromise. 
* **Approaching My Limit:**  While I'm still aiming to pay less than $135, this offer is getting close to the highest amount I'm willing to pay.  
* **Maintaining Momentum:** I want to keep the negotiation moving forward. By making a reasonable counteroffer, I'm encouraging Alice to continue the conversation."
