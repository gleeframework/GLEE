"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you a great deal on this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to let it go for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is much higher than your maximum price and John's offer. It makes no sense to accept $180 when you can get the same product for $120."
