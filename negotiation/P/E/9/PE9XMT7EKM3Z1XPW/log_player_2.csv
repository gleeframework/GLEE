"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* You are looking to pay no more than $120. 
* Alice's offer of $100 is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. 
* Rejecting the offer allows you to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a counteroffer that's $10 lower than Alice's initial price.
* This shows I'm serious about buying the product but also want a good deal.
* It leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects my offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has come down from her initial price, and $95 is still within my budget. 
* Accepting the offer allows me to secure the product at a good price without risking further negotiation. 
*  While I could try for a lower price, there's a risk Alice might reject it, and I might end up paying more or even losing the deal."
