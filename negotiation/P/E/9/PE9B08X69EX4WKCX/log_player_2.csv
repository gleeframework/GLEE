"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm happy to discuss a price that works for both of us. To start, I propose a price of $1,150,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally good negotiation strategy to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's opening offer. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **But Not Too Low:**  Going too low (e.g., below $1,000,000) might offend Alice and make her less willing to negotiate.
* **Polite and Professional:**  Maintaining a positive and respectful tone is important for a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? I'm confident this price reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room to Negotiate:** While Alice moved closer to your desired price, there's still a significant gap.  It's likely she's willing to go lower.
* **Leverage John's Offer:** You have a backup option with John at $1,200,000. This gives you leverage to walk away if Alice doesn't meet your needs. 
* **Time as a Factor:**  Consider how many more rounds you want to dedicate to this. If you're short on time, getting closer to John's offer might be wise."

""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  I'm getting closer to my budget limit.  Could you do $1,075,000?"",

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Steps:** We're moving in smaller increments now to signal that we're getting closer to our limit.
* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows willingness to meet Alice closer to the middle ground.
* **Alternative in Mind:**  We're still a comfortable distance from John's offer, giving us room to negotiate or walk away."
