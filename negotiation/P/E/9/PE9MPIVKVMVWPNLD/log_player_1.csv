Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, $1,300,000 is significantly higher than I had budgeted for.  To be able to make a deal, I'd need to see the price closer to $600,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $600,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a considerable reduction and reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, though, $1,100,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, say around $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
