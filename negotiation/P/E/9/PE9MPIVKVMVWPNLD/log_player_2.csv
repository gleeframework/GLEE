# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and offers a fair starting point for our discussion.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, $1,300,000 is significantly higher than I had budgeted for.  To be able to make a deal, I'd need to see the price closer to $600,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $600,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a considerable reduction and reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but that price doesn't accurately reflect the value of this product. I'm willing to compromise further to $950,000.
