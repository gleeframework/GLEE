Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $119. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing John will buy the product for $120 provides a safety net.  
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below its value to you ($119) creates a sense of a deal for Bob while maximizing your potential profit.

**Why this approach is better than offering a lower price:**

While offering the product at a lower price (e.g., $100) might increase the chance of Bob accepting, it significantly reduces your potential profit if he does. It's a riskier strategy when you have a guaranteed buyer at $120."
