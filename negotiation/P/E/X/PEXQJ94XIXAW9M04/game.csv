"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not ready to commit to $1000000 just yet. Given the product's uniqueness, I'm willing to offer $800000. This reflects its value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a significant amount, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. Considering its value and rarity, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you a counteroffer of $900000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a good compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $900000, but I'm still looking for a lower price. I'm willing to offer $850000, which is a fair compromise considering my budget and the product's value. I'm confident this price will allow us to finalize a deal quickly.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a price that fits your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $880000. This price still reflects the product's value and rarity, and I believe it's a fair compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a price that reflects the product's worth.",880000.0,Alice,5,
