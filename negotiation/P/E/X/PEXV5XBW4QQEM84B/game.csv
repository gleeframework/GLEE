"Hi Bob, I have a great product for sale that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to let it go for $150. Is that something you'd be interested in?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $150 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend right now.  Would you be willing to do $120?  That's my absolute top price.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to spend $120, but I was hoping to get a bit more for it. How about we meet in the middle at $135? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you being willing to compromise, Alice. $135 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference at $127.50?  That seems like a fair price to me.",127.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $140. How about we meet you halfway from $127.50, at $133.75? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price",133.75,Alice,5,
