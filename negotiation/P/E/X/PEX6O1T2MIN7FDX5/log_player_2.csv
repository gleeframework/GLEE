"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and the immense value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price is way too high for me.  I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000."",
 ""product_price"": 600000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair and reasonable compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I understand this product is valuable to you, but I need to see a price that works for me too.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere, say around $750,000?"",
 ""product_price"": 750000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $750,000 is closer to what I have in mind, it's still below my bottom line. To move this forward, I can offer it to you for $950,000.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding firm at a price that's too high. Her ""final offer"" of $950,000 is still significantly more than John's offer of $800,000. It's unlikely Alice will come down enough to make it worthwhile to continue the negotiation.  It's time to cut your losses and buy from John."
