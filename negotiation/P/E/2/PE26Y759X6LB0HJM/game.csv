"Bob, I'm delighted to offer you this exceptional product. It's worth a great deal to both of us, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm starting at $1200000, but I'm open to discussing your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is more than I'm willing to pay.  Considering its value to me, I'm prepared to offer $900000.  Let's work towards a deal that benefits us both.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This gives us both a good deal and keeps the negotiation moving forward.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still not quite there at $1050000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1000000? This would allow me to finalize the purchase and would be a fair price for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
