"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm delighted to offer you this exceptional product. It's worth a great deal to both of us, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm starting at $1200000, but I'm open to discussing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high. While it's worth $1,000,000 to you, she's starting at $1,200,000. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price.  There are still 9 rounds left to reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is more than I'm willing to pay.  Considering its value to me, I'm prepared to offer $900,000.  Let's work towards a deal that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:**  I'm starting with a significant counter-offer ($300,000 less than her initial offer). This shows I'm serious about negotiating and am not just going to slowly chip away at her price.
* **Focus on Value:** I've framed the counter-offer around the product's value to *me*. This implies that I've done my research and am not just throwing out a random number.
* **Collaborative Tone:** I've emphasized that I'm looking for a mutually beneficial deal, keeping the conversation amicable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $900000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This gives us both a good deal and keeps the negotiation moving forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:**  $1,050,000 is still above my target price of $1,000,000. While it's closer, it's not a deal I'm ready to accept yet.
* **Negotiation room:** We've both moved closer to a compromise. There's still room to negotiate a lower price, and I have more rounds to leverage that.
* **Jhon as leverage:**  Knowing I can get the product for $1,000,000 from Jhon gives me a strong bargaining position."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still not quite there at $1,050,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This would allow me to finalize the purchase and would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while maintaining a fair price.
* **Clear target:** Explicitly stating the desired price of $1,000,000 makes the negotiation more focused.
* **Win-Win approach:**  Framing it as a ""fair price for both of us"" keeps the negotiation positive and collaborative."
