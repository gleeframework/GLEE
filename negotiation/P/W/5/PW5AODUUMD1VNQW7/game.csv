"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $8,500.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, Bob! I can see that you're serious about the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I understand your need to make a profit, but $9,500 is still outside my budget.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm offering $9,000.  If you're serious about selling, I'm ready to close the deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see that you're really interested in the product. However, I'm not willing to go down to $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm thinking of $9,750. It's a bit higher than my previous offer, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",9750.0,Alice,5,
