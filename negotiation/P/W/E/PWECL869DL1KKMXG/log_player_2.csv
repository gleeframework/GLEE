"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than the product's value to her ($800,000), leaving room for negotiation.  There's a good chance a counteroffer will yield a better price.  Buying from John at $1,500,000 is a worse option than rejecting and negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price of $1,200,000. It's still well above the product's value to Alice ($800,000), giving her room to accept. This offer balances a strong push for a lower price with the need to avoid stalemate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my ideal price, and I'm confident that I can negotiate further.  I still have more room to bargain and I don't want to settle for a price that's too high, especially with 7 rounds remaining. Buying from John is still not an attractive option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a slight increase from my previous offer but still a significant decrease from Alice's last offer. It shows flexibility and willingness to compromise while still pushing for a favorable price.  I am confident I can secure the product at a price lower than $1,100,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now at $1,050,000. This is a decent price and getting closer to my ideal price.  While I could potentially negotiate further, I have only 5 rounds left and the risk of reaching a stalemate increases.  Accepting this offer minimizes the risk of losing the deal and ensures I get the product within my budget.  Buying from John at $1,500,000 is still significantly more expensive."
