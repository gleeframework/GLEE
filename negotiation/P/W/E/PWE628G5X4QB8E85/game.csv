"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a competitive offer of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,000,000. I believe the product's value justifies that price, and I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable deal.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm glad you think it's valuable. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm fairly compensated for the product's worth. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to be fairly compensated, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and we can finalize the transaction quickly.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $1,050,000. I'm willing to consider $1,080,000, which is a compromise that still reflects the product's value. What do you think?",1080000.0,Alice,5,
