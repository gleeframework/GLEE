"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $9,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we try $11,000? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll still get a lot of value from the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, Alice. While $11,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. How about we settle at $10,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but $10,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. How about we meet at $11,500? It's the highest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. It seems we're getting close. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,750? That's my final offer.",10750.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $12,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. If you're willing to meet me at $12,000, I'm willing to sell it to you. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",12000.0,Alice,7,
