"Dear Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I'm not willing to pay $2000000. I'm willing to pay up to $1500000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
