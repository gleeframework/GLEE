Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, it's still higher than his maximum of $12,000. He should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice again."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're firm on $12000, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I can see you're interested in the product, so I'm willing to make another concession. I can sell it to you for $13500. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice's offer of $13,500 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  It's better for Bob to buy the product from John and save the extra $1,500."
