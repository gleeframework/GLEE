"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  Based on its unique features and potential value, I'm asking for $1000000. I believe this price reflects the significant benefits you'll gain from owning it. Let's discuss further and see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $1,500,000. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer allows you to potentially save more money."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. To make this deal work, I'd need to receive at least $850000.  This reflects the true value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm confident that this product will be a valuable asset for you, and I'm willing to continue this discussion to find a price that works for both of us.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $850,000 is still higher than my preferred price, but it's getting closer to a potential deal. There's still room for negotiation, and I'm not ready to give up on trying to get a better price.  Rejecting her offer and making another counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward."
