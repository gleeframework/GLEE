"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1000000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. To make this deal work, I'd need to receive at least $850000.  This reflects the true value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm confident that this product will be a valuable asset for you, and I'm willing to continue this discussion to find a price that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $800000 for the product.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
