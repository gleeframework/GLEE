**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Bob is willing to pay your minimum acceptable price, indicating its significance to him. This allows for a higher initial offer.
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, there's room to negotiate downwards, closer to his valuation.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** The safety net of John's offer allows for bolder initial pricing, maximizing potential profit."
