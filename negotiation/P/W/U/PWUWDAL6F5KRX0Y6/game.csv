"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $850,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $720,000? I think that's a fair price.",720000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $720,000 is significantly lower than the product's value.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $780,000. This price is still fair considering the product's worth, and it allows for a mutually beneficial deal. What do you say?",780000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $780,000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",750000.0,Bob,4,
