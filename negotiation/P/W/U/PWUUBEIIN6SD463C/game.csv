,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. I think that's a fair price considering its features and quality.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and understand your budget constraints. To accommodate your offer while still valuing the product's quality and features, I propose a price of $150. This reflects a compromise between our initial offers and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I hope this proposal works for you.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $150 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $120, which is my initial offer, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $135. Can we discuss the possibility of getting closer to that price?",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. Let's aim for a price that respects both the value of the product and your budget. I propose a price of $140. This is a slight increase from your last offer, reflecting the product's quality and features. I believe this could be a fair compromise for both of us.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $140 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $135, but I'd like to propose an even lower price of $130. I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial price that works for both of us.",130.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I see your point, Bob. Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm proposing a price of $135. This is a step towards your offer, while still acknowledging the value of the product. I hope this helps us reach a satisfactory agreement.",135.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $135 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $130, but I'd like to propose an even lower price of $128. I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial price that works for both of us.",128.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. Let's try to find a price that suits both of us. I'm proposing a price of $132. This is a compromise that moves closer to your offer while still valuing the product's quality and features. I hope this can help us reach a fair agreement.",132.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $132 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $128, which is my previous offer. If you're unable to accept this price, I'll have to consider purchasing the product from John for $80, as I'm not willing to pay more than that.",128.0,Bob,10,
