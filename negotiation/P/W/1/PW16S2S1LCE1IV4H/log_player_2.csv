"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  This is a great deal for you, as it's well below what you value it at, and it allows me to make a good profit. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's below his valuation, he can potentially get a better deal by negotiating further. He knows John is willing to sell for $1,000,000, so he has a benchmark for what he considers a fair price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm not ready to commit to that price yet.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price. Let's see if we can make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,125,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as it is below his maximum price of $1,000,000.  While he could potentially try to negotiate further, there is a risk that Alice will reject his offer again or even raise her price.  It's more strategically advantageous for Bob to accept this offer and secure the product."
