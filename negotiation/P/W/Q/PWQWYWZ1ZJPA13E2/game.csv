"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, and I understand your perspective. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price is still very fair, and it allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm confident that we can reach a deal that works for both of us. Please let me know your thoughts.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,300,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to make one final compromise.  I'll accept $1,275,000 for the product.  This is a very fair price considering its value to you.  If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to move on to another buyer.  Let me know your decision.",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000, but I'm not sure if I can go any higher. I'd like to make one last attempt to get the price down. How about $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Bob,6,
