"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the deal, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,500 is a bit high for you, but I'm still looking to make a good profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is the best price I can offer at this point.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product and am willing to pay $8,750.  This would be a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can make it work.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,750 is still a bit above your target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession to get this deal done. I'm offering the product to you for $8,900. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",8900.0,Alice,5,
