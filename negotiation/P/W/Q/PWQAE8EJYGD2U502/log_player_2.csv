"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,500 is a bit high for you, but I'm still looking to make a good profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is the best price I can offer at this point.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than John's price, Bob can still try to negotiate further.  He's willing to pay up to $8,500, so there's room for Alice to come down a bit more."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,750 is still a bit above your target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession to get this deal done. I'm offering the product to you for $8,900. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $8,900 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than John's price of $10,000, and it's only $200 higher than Bob's maximum price of $8,750.  It's a good compromise, and Bob should accept it."
