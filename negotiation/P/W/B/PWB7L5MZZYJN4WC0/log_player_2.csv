"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a high-demand item. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still quite high, leaving significant room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
