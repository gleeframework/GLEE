Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm going to counteroffer at $140. Is that something you'd be interested in?"", ""product_price"": 140}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand you're trying to be reasonable, Bob, but $95 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, so I'll counteroffer at $120. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 120}"
