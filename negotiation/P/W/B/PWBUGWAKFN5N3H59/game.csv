"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer but $180 is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $80 for the product.  What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm going to counteroffer at $140. Is that something you'd be interested in?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice, but $140 is still a bit too steep for my budget. How about $95? That's a fair bit closer to your price.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to be reasonable, Bob, but $95 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, so I'll counteroffer at $120. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's a fair price for the product.",120.0,Alice,5,
