Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $19,000. It's a unique item I believe you'll find valuable. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing your minimum:** You have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 to John, so you should aim higher with Bob.
* **Starting high:**  A starting price of $19,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. Even if he negotiates you down, you're still likely to make more than your guaranteed $15,000.
* **Gauging interest:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest level. If he outright rejects it, you haven't lost anything and can proceed with John. 

**Important:** This strategy assumes you have no time constraint or pressure to sell immediately. If you need to sell quickly, a lower initial offer might be more suitable."
