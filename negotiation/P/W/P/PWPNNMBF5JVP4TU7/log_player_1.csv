"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's close to the middle ground between my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Friendly Tone:**  Using a friendly tone helps build rapport and may make Bob more willing to negotiate. 
* **Open Ended Question:** Asking ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to engage in the negotiation rather than just accepting or rejecting outright."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $100 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. How about $90?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:**  Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but there's still room for negotiation. I believe I can get a better price than $90.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By rejecting his offer, I show that I'm not desperate to sell and that I'm willing to continue negotiating. 
* **Time Factor:** We're still early in the negotiation process.  It's worth exploring if I can secure a higher price within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for something closer to my asking price. Would you be willing to go up to $95?  That would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm not accepting Bob's offer but making a counter-offer that's closer to my ideal price while still being reasonable given his initial response. 
* **Compromise:** I'm willing to compromise but still trying to maximize my earnings. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the offer as a ""good deal"" for both of us to maintain a positive tone and encourage further negotiation."
