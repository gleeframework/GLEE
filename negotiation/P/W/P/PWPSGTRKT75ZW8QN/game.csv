"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it allows me to make a decent profit while still giving you a substantial saving. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This is a fair price that allows you to make a profit while ensuring I get a good deal. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,050,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a fair price.  How about $1,080,000? This would still be a significant savings for you, while allowing me to get closer to my target.",1080000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not quite there. How about $1,060,000? This is a good compromise and gives us both a good deal.  Let's make this happen.",1060000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing your point, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,070,000? This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's close this deal now.",1070000.0,Alice,5,
