"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm asking for $22,000. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000 for the product.  What would you say?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget concerns, Bob, but $8,000 is significantly less than the product's value. Let's find a middle ground: How about $19,000? I'm confident we can make this work.",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $19,000 is still too high for my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $9,500.  Let me know if that works for you.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our positions is still quite large. To be frank, I have another buyer who's prepared to pay $15,000. I'd prefer to work something out with you, but I need you to meet me closer to that figure.  Would you consider $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have other offers, but I'm serious about staying within my budget.  I can go up to $11,000, but that's my absolute limit.  It's a fair offer considering your other buyer and my walk-away price.",11000.0,Bob,6,
