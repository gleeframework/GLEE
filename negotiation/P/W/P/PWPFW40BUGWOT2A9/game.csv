"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that amount.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a compromise, but I believe it fairly reflects the product's worth.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm proposing $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. While $950,000 is still less than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to accept a final offer of $1,025,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to close this deal.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make a final offer of $980,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",980000.0,Bob,6,
