"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. To start the conversation, I propose a price of $950,000."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, starting with a strong offer of $950,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a high profit margin. 
* **Confident Tone:**  The message conveys confidence in the product's value and the potential for a deal. This can encourage Bob to take the offer seriously.
* **Open to Negotiation:** By stating ""to start the conversation,"" it's clear that this is an opening move and further discussion is expected."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain limit. I would like to counteroffer at $700,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($800,000) and his perceived value ($1,000,000). Accepting would mean a substantial loss compared to selling to John. There's a lot of room for negotiation, so it's worth continuing the discussion with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see a price that reflects the product's worth. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000?"",
""product_price"": 875000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging & Rejecting:** The message politely acknowledges Bob's offer while making it clear that $700,000 is unacceptable.
* **Justification:** Emphasizing the product's value reinforces the idea that a higher price is warranted. 
* **Compromise:** Suggesting $875,000, the midpoint between the initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, signals a willingness to negotiate while still aiming high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I still believe there's room for negotiation. My counteroffer would be $825,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $825,000 is now above your minimum acceptable price and provides a reasonable profit. While there might be a slim chance of negotiating a slightly higher price, the difference is not significant enough to risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting this offer secures a good outcome."
