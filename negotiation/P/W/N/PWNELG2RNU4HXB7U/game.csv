"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,300,000 is a bit below my target price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my costs. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
