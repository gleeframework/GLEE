"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than what John is offering, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,300,000 is a bit below my target price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my costs. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,350,000 is within Bob's budget and is a better deal than buying from John.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice could reject again, and then Bob would have to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting this offer secures the product for Bob at a reasonable price."
