"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $100 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $90? ",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and $90 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about $95?  That's a fair compromise, and still gives you a good value.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $95 is still a little high for me.  I'm really hoping to stay around $90.  How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? ",92.5,Bob,4,
