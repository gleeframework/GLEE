"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $18000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $13000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $13000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $16500. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business.",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $16500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford at this time. I'm willing to go up to $14000. Let's try to reach an agreement that works for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
