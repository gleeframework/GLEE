"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $12,500? This would still be a great deal for you, as it's well below its worth to you.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand, Alice, and I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $12,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something a bit more budget-friendly. Would you be open to $11,750?",11750.0,Bob,4,
