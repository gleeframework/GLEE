"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $14,000 is close to my limit, there's still room for negotiation. Alice is motivated to sell, and I know her product's worth to her is significantly less. By countering, I might secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** This counter-offer attempts to anchor the negotiation closer to my target price. It's a significant jump down from Alice's offer but still leaves room for further negotiation. By expressing continued interest and offering a specific number, I show seriousness while leaving the door open for a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $12,500? This would still be a great deal for you, as it's well below its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is moving towards a more agreeable price, but it's still above my ideal target. Rejecting this offer signals that I'm willing to negotiate further and aim for a better deal.  I'm getting closer to my walk-away point ($15,000 from John), but there might still be room for Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice, and I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $12,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something a bit more budget-friendly. Would you be open to $11,750?"",
""product_price"": 11750
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

* **Incremental Increase:** By countering with $11,750, I'm showing willingness to move from my initial offer but still indicating that her previous price is too high.
* **Signaling Flexibility:**  A smaller counter-offer increment can signal that I'm getting closer to my limit and encourage Alice to make a more significant move. 
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:** The message remains polite and respectful, acknowledging Alice's effort while reiterating my desired price range."
