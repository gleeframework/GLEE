"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you. However, $1,100,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop to $1,250,000. This offer is good for the next 24 hours, so let me know if you're interested.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground here.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,150,000 is closer, it's still a bit short of what I need. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $1,200,000.  This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested.",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but I'm still not quite there. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal.",1175000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  However, I'm firm on my price of $1,200,000. This is my final offer.  If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm prepared to move on to other options.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
