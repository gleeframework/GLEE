"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm not sure I can go that high right now.  I'm really interested in this product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $12000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13500. It's a great compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. $13500 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $12750?  I'm really hoping to finalize this deal today.",12750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to reach a compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, so I'll offer you the product for $13875. It's a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth it.",13875.0,Alice,5,
