"Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. It's worth a significant amount to me, reflecting its quality and potential. To start the conversation, I propose a price of $1,800,000. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in your product, $1,800,000 is significantly more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm confident this product is valuable, but I'm only able to offer $1,200,000 at this time.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, the value of this product to me is quite high. How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,500,000 is still more than I can comfortably spend. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  If you're open to that, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
