"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the potential of this product, $900,000 is a bit steep for me at this stage.  I'm willing to pay $850,000, which reflects the value I see in it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $950,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value it will bring to your business.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $950,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to offer $900,000.  This price reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $900,000. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering it to you for $925,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",925000.0,Alice,5,
