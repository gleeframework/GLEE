"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to revolutionize your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is tempting, but not ideal.** While $900,000 is a good price, I can likely get it lower.
* **Negotiation is worth exploring.** I have 10 rounds to try and get a better deal. 
* **John's offer is a safety net.**  I can always go to John if I can't reach a satisfactory agreement with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the potential of this product, $900,000 is a bit steep for me at this stage.  I'm willing to pay $850,000, which reflects the value I see in it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $950,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is closer, but still too high.**  I'm hoping to get closer to my initial counteroffer of $850,000. 
* **Negotiation is still worthwhile.** I have 7 rounds left to potentially get a better deal.
* **John's offer is still a safety net.**  I can still go to John if things don't work out with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $950,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to offer $900,000.  This price reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $900,000. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering it to you for $925,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price.**  I'm only $25,000 away from my initial counteroffer of $850,000.
* **The risk of rejecting is high.** If I reject this offer, Alice may be less willing to negotiate further, and I could end up paying more in the end.
* **John's offer is still a safety net, but it's becoming less appealing.**  While I could still go to John, I'm already saving $275,000 by buying from Alice.

At this point, accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible decision."
