"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $9500 is a great starting point, but I'm looking to stay under $9000 if possible. Would you be willing to come down to $9000? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not comfortable going down to $9000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $9200. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the extra $200.",9200.0,Alice,3,
