"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 undervalues the product significantly. I've done extensive research and analysis, and I'm confident that its true value is much higher. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This offer reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that you believe the product has significant value, but I'm still not convinced that $1,150,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be realistic about my budget. I'm thinking of a price around $950,000. Can we discuss this further and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement?",950000.0,Bob,4,
