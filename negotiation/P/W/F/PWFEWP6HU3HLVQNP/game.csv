"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Is there any room for negotiation?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,250? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to be flexible to make this work.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $8,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $7,500 is too low, but $8,000 is more in line with what I'm comfortable paying. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8000.0,Bob,4,
