"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product looks great, $20,000 is a bit outside my budget. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I understand your budget constraints, $11,000 is significantly less than what I can accept for this product. Could you consider something closer to $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
