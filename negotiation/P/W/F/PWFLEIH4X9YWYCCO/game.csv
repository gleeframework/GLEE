"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really serious about buying this product, but I can only afford $9,000. If we can reach an agreement at that price, I'm ready to close the deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000, Bob. I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500. This is my final offer, and I'm not budging from here. What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $9,500 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9,250. It's a fair price considering what we've discussed, and it's the best I can do.  What do you think?",9250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not getting any younger, Bob, and I'm starting to think you're not serious about buying this product. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, but I need to see some more commitment from you. I'm going to give you one last chance to meet me at $9,500. If not, I'll have to consider other options. What's it going to be?",9500.0,Alice,7,
