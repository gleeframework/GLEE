"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident we can work out a deal that's mutually beneficial. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. Let's meet in the middle.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that allows us both to reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,150,000 simply doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $1,200,000. This is my final offer, as I'm confident it's a fair price that reflects the product's value.  Let me know if you're interested, or I'll have to move on to other potential buyers.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
