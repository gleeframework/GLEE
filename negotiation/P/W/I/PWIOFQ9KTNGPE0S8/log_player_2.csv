Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price.  There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price.  It's worth risking another round to see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that allows us both to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,150,000 simply doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $1,200,000. This is my final offer, as I'm confident it's a fair price that reflects the product's value.  Let me know if you're interested, or I'll have to move on to other potential buyers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```
