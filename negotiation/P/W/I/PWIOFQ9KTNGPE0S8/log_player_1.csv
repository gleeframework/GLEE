"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $1,100,000 is too low for me, and I'm confident I can get a better price. I still have 9 rounds to make a deal with Bob, or I can always sell to John for $1,200,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that allows us both to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'll continue negotiating with Bob, as I have more rounds available and there's potential to secure a better deal."

Round 5

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,150,000 simply doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $1,200,000. This is my final offer, as I'm confident it's a fair price that reflects the product's value.  Let me know if you're interested, or I'll have to move on to other potential buyers."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
