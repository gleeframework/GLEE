"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference at $90? That's still a great deal for you, as you'll be getting the product for less than it's worth to you.",90.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but $90 is still a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $87.50 for the product. That's the highest I'm willing to go.",87.5,Bob,4,
