"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to go up to $990,000. I'm willing to meet you at that price, but I'd like to add a small premium for the hassle of negotiating with you. I'm counteroffering at $995,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $995,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $995,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

It's time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Price:** $995,000 is a good deal. It's significantly less than her initial offer and just slightly below your $1,000,000 walk-away point.
* **Risk:** Continuing to negotiate could backfire. Alice might become less willing to compromise, and you risk ending up with a worse deal or having to go with John at the last minute. 

While you could try for another $5,000 off, the savings aren't worth the potential risk at this point."
