"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's something you'll find very valuable.  I'm asking for $95 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $100.
* Alice is offering it for $95.
* You can buy the product from John for $100.

Since you can get the product from John for your maximum value, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
