Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's something you'll find very valuable.  I'm asking for $95 for it."",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $95 leaves a small window for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Ensure a Sale:** Offering it for much higher (e.g., $99) risks Bob rejecting it outright, leaving you with the guaranteed $80 from John. 

This strategy balances ambition with the security of a guaranteed sale."
