Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible without going below your minimum ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, getting you closer to your desired profit.
* **Alternative Option:** You have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John, so there's no pressure to go below your minimum."
