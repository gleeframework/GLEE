"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm offering Bob the product for $120. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is a good price, I'm aiming for more. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm offering Bob the product for $110. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and it still leaves some room for negotiation."
