"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm looking to get the best deal possible. Can you meet me at that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a good price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $11,000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
