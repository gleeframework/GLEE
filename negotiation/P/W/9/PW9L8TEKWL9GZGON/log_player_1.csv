"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point, as it's higher than my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation. It's important to start high to maximize potential profit, but not so high that it scares Bob away immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell right away. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $13,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate, but still higher than Bob's offer. This should keep the negotiation moving forward and hopefully lead to a deal closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price. There are still several rounds left, and I'm willing to risk losing a bit more time to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm going to offer $12,500.  This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's latest one.  It's also only $500 above my minimum acceptable price, so I'm nearing my limit.  Hopefully, Bob sees this as a fair price and agrees to the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is now below my minimum acceptable price.  While I could keep negotiating, it's getting late in the game. I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price, especially since John is guaranteed to buy for my minimum. I'm going to sell to John for $12,000."
