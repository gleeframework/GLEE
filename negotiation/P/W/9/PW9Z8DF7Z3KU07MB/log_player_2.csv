"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 
Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum valuation and John's offer. You should attempt to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $750,000. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 750000
}
``` 

This counter-offer achieves a few things:

* **Polite and respectful:**  Maintains a positive tone for negotiation.
* **States your position clearly:**  Indicates that the initial price is unacceptable.
* **Provides a strong counter:** $750,000 is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, leaving room for negotiation but also signaling that you are serious about getting a good deal.
* **Open-ended:**  Invites Alice to respond and continue the discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your position.  However, $750,000 is significantly below the product's value. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,000,000, which is still a fair price for both of us.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Alice has come down to John's price.  There's no point in negotiating further as it's unlikely she'll go any lower, and you're guaranteed the product at that price from John."
