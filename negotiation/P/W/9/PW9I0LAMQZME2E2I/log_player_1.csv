Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I believe we can come to a more agreeable price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While $950,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and attempt to secure a better deal in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I need to stay closer to my initial asking price. I'm willing to drop to $1,100,000. This price still reflects the value of the product and provides us both with a good outcome."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,050,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable accepting it. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,075,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and the time we've invested in this negotiation. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We are approaching the end of the negotiation rounds, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.  While I'd prefer to close the deal with Bob, I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.  Therefore, I will choose to sell the product to John."
