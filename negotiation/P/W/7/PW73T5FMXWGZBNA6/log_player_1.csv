"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  I'm starting with a price of $100, which is significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob ($80), but still lower than my minimum acceptable price ($120). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and optimistic, hoping to build rapport with Bob and make him more receptive to the offer. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  Mentioning the product's usefulness is a subtle attempt to make it seem more valuable to Bob, even though he already knows its worth.
* **Open-Ended Question:** The question ""What do you say?"" encourages Bob to respond and keeps the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I can only pay up to $90 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'm hoping to get. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's still room for further negotiation.  I believe I can push for a higher price, especially since I have 8 rounds left.
* **John's Offer:**  While $120 is a tempting option, I'm not ready to give up on Bob yet. 
* **Strategic Play:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I demonstrate my commitment to getting a better price and might make Bob more willing to compromise in future rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95? It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm proposing a counteroffer of $95, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I remind Bob that the price is still a good deal for him, even though it's slightly higher than his initial offer.
* **Positive Tone:** I use a friendly and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation amicable. 
* **Clear Call to Action:** I end with a direct question to get Bob's response and move the negotiation forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Considering your costs, I believe $92 would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know if this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While $92 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'm hoping to achieve. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe I can still push for a slightly higher price. I have 6 rounds left, and with each rejection, I demonstrate my willingness to hold out for a better deal.
* **John's Offer:** $120 is still on the table, but I'm not ready to walk away just yet. 
* **Strategic Play:** Rejecting Bob's offer shows him that I'm serious about maximizing my profit. This could lead him to make a more favorable counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $92 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $94? It's a small increase, but it would make a big difference to me. Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 94}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm proposing a counteroffer of $94, which is again halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows continued flexibility and willingness to compromise, but also demonstrates that I'm not willing to settle for much less than my target price. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I emphasize that the price is still a good deal for Bob, highlighting the small difference between his offer and mine.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a friendly and encouraging tone, hoping to keep the negotiation productive and amicable. 
* **Clear Call to Action:** I ask for a direct response from Bob, hoping to get a quick decision and move the negotiation forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I'm willing to go up to $93 for the product. This is the highest I can go without exceeding my budget. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $93. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $93
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $93 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $94.  
* **Limited Rounds:** We are now in round 6, leaving only 4 rounds left.  There's a risk that continuing to negotiate could result in a lower final price or no deal at all.
* **John's Offer:** While $120 is tempting, it's important to consider the time and effort involved in negotiating with Bob.  If I reject this offer, there's no guarantee I'll get a better price in the remaining rounds. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The risk of rejecting this offer and potentially getting a lower price in the next few rounds outweighs the potential reward of holding out for a higher price. 

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Bob's offer of $93 ensures a deal, maximizes my profit given the remaining time, and avoids the risk of a stalemate or a lower final price."
