"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $110. I think it's a great deal for you considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:**  Bob values the product at $120, so anything less is a good deal.
* **Alice's Offer:**  $110 is close to Bob's maximum value, but there's room for negotiation. 
* **Strategy:** By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to get a lower price.  It's possible to get a better deal, and Bob has 9 more rounds to do so."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial Counteroffer:**  A $10 counteroffer is a significant move but still leaves room for Alice to make a reasonable profit.
* **Maintaining Room:**  This counteroffer doesn't immediately drop to Bob's minimum value, allowing for further negotiation.
* **Respectful Communication:**  The message acknowledges Alice's offer and provides a reason for the counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:**  $105 is still within Bob's budget and a good deal.
* **Negotiation Progress:**  Alice has already moved significantly from her initial $110 offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While Bob could try to push for a lower price, there's a risk that Alice might not budge further, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price. 

By accepting Alice's offer, Bob secures a good deal without risking a stalemate."
