"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $8000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still more than he's willing to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the deal, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $11000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the value you place on the product at $8000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than he's willing to pay. He should continue negotiating to try and get a better price. It's possible that Alice will come down further, or Bob can continue to counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I can manage right now.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your proposal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm still willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm offering it to you for $11500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price, but she's still unwilling to go below $11,500. This is getting close to Bob's budget, but it's still higher than what he's willing to pay.  At this point, Bob is better off buying from John for $8,000.  Further negotiation with Alice might result in a lower price, but there's no guarantee, and it could risk losing the opportunity to buy from John altogether."
