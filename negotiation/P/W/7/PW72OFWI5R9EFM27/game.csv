"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $8000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the deal, $12000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $11000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the value you place on the product at $8000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a bit more than I can manage right now.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10000?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your proposal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm still willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm offering it to you for $11500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,5,
