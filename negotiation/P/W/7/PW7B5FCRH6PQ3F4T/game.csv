"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product, considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'll counteroffer at $1,025,000. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's try to bridge the gap and make this deal happen.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to reach a fair price, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll counteroffer at $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
