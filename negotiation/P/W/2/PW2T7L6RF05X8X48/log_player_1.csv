{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $135. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's below your minimum price of $150, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to haggle.  It's also a reasonable starting point for Bob, as it's above his perceived value of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $135 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. It's significantly below my minimum price of $150, and also below the value of the product to me. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
