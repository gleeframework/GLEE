"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $95. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum value of $80 but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is above my minimum, it's still too low considering the product's value to Bob. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $90.  This shows flexibility while still keeping the price significantly higher than Bob's offer. I believe this counteroffer is fair and will encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Although Bob has increased his offer, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push for a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 88}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to $88.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still a good price for me considering the product's value to Bob.  This is likely my last counteroffer before I consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $84. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $84
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob has shown he's not willing to go much higher.  Accepting his offer at $84 is the best option right now, as it's significantly better than selling to John for $80. I'm also running out of rounds, so I need to close the deal."
