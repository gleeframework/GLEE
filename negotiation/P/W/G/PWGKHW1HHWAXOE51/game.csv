"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it.",60.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $120 is a bit high for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I can meet you in the middle at $90. It's a fair price for a unique product like this, and I think you'll really appreciate it.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit, but $90 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about $70?",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're still a bit hesitant, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $85? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm getting a bit anxious to sell this product.",85.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer. I'd be willing to do $75, but that's as high as I can go.",75.0,Bob,6,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob, but I'm still not quite there. I can do $82.50, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a fair price for a unique product like this, and I think you'll really appreciate it.",82.5,Alice,7,
