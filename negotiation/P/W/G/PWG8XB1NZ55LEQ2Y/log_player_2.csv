Alice's offer:

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her original price, it's still higher than what he can get from John.  He should try to negotiate further to get a lower price."

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  Alice's offer is still a bit higher than what John is selling the product for, and it's unlikely she'll go lower at this point."
