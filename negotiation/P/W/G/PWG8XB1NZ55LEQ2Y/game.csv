"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm thinking of a price of $1,100,000. Is that more to your liking?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $1,100,000 is still a little high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000.  Let's split the difference and get this done.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm thinking of a price of $1,087,500. It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",1087500.0,Alice,5,
