"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $1,100,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, but still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1,075,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a tight budget.  While $1,075,000 is below what I initially hoped for,  I'm willing to accept $1,100,000 as a final compromise. This is the best I can do to make this deal work, and I'm confident it will still be a worthwhile investment for you. Let's finalize this and move forward.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"I've thought it over, and I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that if we can't come to an agreement, I'll have to look elsewhere for the product.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
