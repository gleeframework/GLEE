"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. While I see its value,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit lower than what I was initially thinking, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for being flexible. I appreciate the willingness to come down in price. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This feels like a good middle ground, and I believe we can both be happy with this price.  Let's close the deal!",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $1,150,000. I can offer you a slight concession, but I need to ensure I get a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,120,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",1120000.0,Alice,5,
