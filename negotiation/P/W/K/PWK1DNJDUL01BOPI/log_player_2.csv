You're still in a good position to negotiate further. $1,150,000 is closer to your goal, but you can likely get it lower with another counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $1,150,000. I can offer you a slight concession, but I need to ensure I get a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,120,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.

While you could potentially continue negotiating, Alice is now very close to your desired price, and it's possible she won't budge further. Accepting her offer of $1,120,000 is a good compromise that saves you a significant amount compared to buying from John."
