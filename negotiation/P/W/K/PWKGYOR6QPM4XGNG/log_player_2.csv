"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,150,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,150,000 is a good price, Bob can potentially save more money by negotiating with Alice. There's a $50,000 gap between Alice's offer and Bob's maximum price. Rejecting allows Bob to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my budget.  While I'm interested,  I'm not quite ready to pay $1,150,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,100,000?  I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, and your understanding of the product's value.  How about we meet closer to the middle at $1,125,000? This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,125,000, which is only $25,000 above Bob's counteroffer and within his budget. Accepting this offer allows Bob to save a significant amount compared to buying from John, and it's a reasonable compromise given the product's value.  Further negotiation might save a little more, but the risk of Alice rejecting and Bob having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential small savings."
