"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price. I'm offering the product to you for $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is still too high for Bob's budget.  Bob has 10 rounds to negotiate and can always purchase from John for $800,000, so it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $1,000,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $950,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this price still reflects the product's value and is a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $950,000 is still above Bob's budget of $800,000. Bob has more rounds to negotiate and can always purchase from John for a lower price, so it's still in his best interest to reject the offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. It's a fair price that allows me to acquire the product while staying within my budget."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're committed to your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $900,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this price still reflects the product's value and is a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's preferred price, $900,000 is still over Bob's budget.  Bob has 5 rounds left and can always purchase from John for $800,000. It's still in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not quite there.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $875,000. This price is fair for both of us and allows me to acquire the product without exceeding my budget."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession to meet your budget. I can offer you the product for $925,000, which is a good compromise between our previous offers. However, I want to make it clear that this is my final offer, and I won't go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated that $925,000 is her final offer. Bob has only three rounds left, and it's unlikely that Alice will budge further.  Since Bob can purchase the product from John for $800,000, it's in his best interest to accept this offer and avoid further negotiation."
