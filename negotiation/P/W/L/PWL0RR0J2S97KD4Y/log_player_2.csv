"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at this point. You have no information about her value for the product, and there's a chance you might be able to get a better price by negotiating.  It's also worth exploring the negotiation with Alice to see if there's any wiggle room in her price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Starting with a significant discount (25%) is a common strategy in negotiation. It signals your seriousness about purchasing the product while leaving room for a potential compromise. This counteroffer is also within your budget, making it a reasonable starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has lowered her price, showing a willingness to negotiate. However, there's still potential for a better deal. Rejecting her offer allows for further negotiation and potentially achieving a price closer to your desired $900,000.  Buying from John at this point would be less beneficial as Alice is already offering a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, but her offer is still higher than your initial counteroffer. Increasing your offer slightly to $950,000 shows a willingness to compromise while staying within your budget. This might encourage Alice to meet you halfway in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is continuing to lower her price, indicating she wants to make a deal.  However, her price is still higher than your target. Rejecting her offer gives you another opportunity to counter and potentially get a better price. Buying from John would be less advantageous since Alice is offering a better price than John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is showing flexibility in her pricing, and we're getting closer to our target. Increasing the counteroffer to $1,000,000 shows a genuine attempt to find a middle ground.  With only four rounds left, it's important to start closing the gap to avoid having to resort to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,015,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,015,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has lowered her price significantly.  With only three rounds left, it's becoming increasingly risky to continue negotiating.  The potential for a further reduction is small, and accepting this offer guarantees a purchase within your budget while saving a substantial amount compared to buying from John."
