Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price of $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100. It's still a good deal for you, and we can close this deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $90 is a bit too low for you, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm still hopeful that I can get a higher price from Bob. While $95 is tempting, it's not as close to my target price as I'd like. I'll reject this offer and see if Bob will come up further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to sell it to you for $100.  That way we both get a fair deal, and we can close this quickly."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that we're close to a deal, but I'm still trying to save some money. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $98? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's becoming clear that Bob won't budge much further. While $98 is a decent offer, it's still not close enough to my desired price.  I'm running out of rounds, so I'm going to take the guaranteed $120 from John."
