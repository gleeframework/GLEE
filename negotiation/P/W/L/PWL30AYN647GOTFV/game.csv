"Bob, I'm offering you my product at $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know the product is worth $1,200,000 to you. Let's make this happen!",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a great deal for you, and leaves me a bit of room to negotiate. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $1,300,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your firm stance, and I see we're getting closer. While $1,250,000 is still a bit below my target, I'm willing to compromise further.  How about $1,275,000? This would allow us to close the deal without either of us having to walk away. What do you say?",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm afraid $1,275,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,225,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
