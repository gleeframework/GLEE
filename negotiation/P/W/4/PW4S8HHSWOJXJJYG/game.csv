"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm looking for a serious buyer, and I think you might be the right person for this. I'm willing to offer it to you for $20000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $20000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $20000 is a bit steep, but $8000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $14000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $14000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $11000. This is my final offer, as I'm also considering other options.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty about considering other options, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11000 and $14000, which would be $12500. This is my best offer so far, and I'm hoping you'll consider it.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with $12500.  I'm willing to go up to $11500.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the value of the product.",11500.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $11500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11500 and $12500, which would be $12000. This is my best compromise so far, and I hope you'll consider it.",12000.0,Alice,7,
