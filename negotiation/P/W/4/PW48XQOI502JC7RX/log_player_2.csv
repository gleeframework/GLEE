Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $775,000.

Alice has indicated this is her final offer. Continuing to negotiate is risky. While John offers the product for $1,000,000, accepting Alice's offer at $810,000 still represents a significant saving."
