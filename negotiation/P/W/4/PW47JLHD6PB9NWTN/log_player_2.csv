"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is better than John's price, it's still above Bob's $10,000 limit.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I really appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  While it's a good price, I'm really hoping to stay closer to my budget of $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider $10,500?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're trying to stay within your budget. However, I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,900. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down in price, but it's still above Bob's limit.  There's a good chance she'll continue to negotiate, and Bob can potentially get a better price than John's."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. I'm still a bit outside of my budget though.  Could we meet in the middle again at $10,700?"", ""product_price"": 10700}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're still trying to stretch your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,800. This is as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his desired $10,000.  Bob can still try to negotiate down further, or he can buy from John. Given that they have a few rounds left, it's worth attempting another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. Unfortunately, I'm still a bit over my limit. Would you be willing to do $10,200? I understand this might be a little lower than what you're looking for, but it's the best I can do."", ""product_price"": 10200}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're really trying to make this work, Bob. However, I've already compromised a lot on the price. I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,600. This is the best price I can offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear she won't go lower than $10,600.  Bob has only three rounds left, and the potential for further negotiation is low.  Buying from John at $10,000 is the most cost-effective option at this point."
