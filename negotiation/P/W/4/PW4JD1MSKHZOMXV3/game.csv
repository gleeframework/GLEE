"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly beneficial for you.  I'm asking for $18,000 to start the conversation. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm thinking closer to $6,000. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the product has value, but $14,000 is still too high for my budget.  Could you consider $7,000?  I think that's a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $7,000 is just too low. How about $11,500?  This offer stands until the end of the next round, as I do have another interested buyer.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me too.  While I understand you have another buyer, $11,500 is still a bit beyond what I'm looking to spend. Could we settle at $8,000? That's my final offer.",8000.0,Bob,6,
