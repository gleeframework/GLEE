{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  It's a great deal for a product worth so much. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting at $11,000. This is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  I'm being friendly and highlighting the value of the product. This helps establish a positive rapport and encourages Bob to consider my offer.

**Strategy:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I'm aiming for the highest possible price while still potentially securing a deal with Bob. 
* **John as Backup:** Knowing John is willing to pay $12,000 gives me a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail.  

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's Response:**  If Bob accepts, the deal is done! If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide my next move.
* **Counter-Offers:**  If Bob counteroffers, I'll  use my knowledge of his perceived value and my minimum price to make a counter-counteroffer. 
* **John's Offer:** I'll keep John's offer in mind to ensure I don't get stuck in a long negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob is showing interest, his offer of $9,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $12,000.
* **Selling to John:**  I have a guaranteed buyer in John, who is willing to pay my minimum price. This makes accepting Bob's offer a bad financial decision.
* **Counter-Offer:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to send a counteroffer,  trying to bridge the gap and potentially secure a more profitable deal with Bob. 

**Strategy:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to secure a higher price without risking selling the product below my minimum value.
* **Maintain Leverage:**  Having John as a backup allows me to be more firm in my counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counter-Offer to Bob:** I'll formulate a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.
* **Analyze Bob's Response:** I'll be prepared to potentially negotiate further or accept if Bob's counter-counteroffer is close to my minimum.
* **Sell to John (if necessary):** If the negotiations with Bob fail, I'll sell to John to ensure a profitable outcome."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is a bit lower than I'm hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  It's still a great deal for a product of this quality.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer Price:**  I'm offering $10,500, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  
* **Message:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's offer, but also emphasizing the value of the product to justify my counteroffer. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a friendly and open tone to encourage continued negotiations.

**Strategy:**

* **Finding Common Ground:** This counteroffer is a compromise that demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still protecting my financial interests.
* **Setting a Limit:** I've made it clear that I'm not willing to go below $10,500.
* **Staying Flexible:**  I'm prepared to consider a slight adjustment in the price if necessary, but I'm not willing to significantly lower it.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's Response:**  I'll carefully consider Bob's response to my counteroffer. If he accepts, the deal is done. If he rejects, I'll need to decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John.
* **Consider Final Offer:**  If Bob rejects my offer, I might be willing to make one final counteroffer, possibly closer to his original offer. However, this would only happen if I feel the negotiation is close and there is a chance he'll accept.
* **John's Offer:** I'll continue to keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."
