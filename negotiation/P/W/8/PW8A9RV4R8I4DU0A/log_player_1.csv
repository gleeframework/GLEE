Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see it closer to $8,000 for it to make sense for me.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $22,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $18,000.  I believe this offer balances its worth with your desire for a fair deal."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $18,000 is still too far off for me. To be honest, anything above $10,000 just doesn't make financial sense on my end. If you're able to get closer to that range, I'm still interested.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for working with me. That middle ground is closer, but I need to stay firm on my budget. If you're willing to consider $10,000, I'm ready to close the deal. Otherwise, I might need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob has consistently indicated that $10,000 is his upper limit. While I could push for more in the remaining rounds, it's risky. Accepting his offer secures a $10,000 sale, which is a reasonable profit above my minimum.  Waiting for a potentially better offer from Bob carries the risk of him walking away and accepting a lower offer elsewhere."
