Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. However, given the costs and investments made into the product, we cannot agree to the proposed price. We would like to counter with an offer of $950,000. This price still allows us a reasonable return on investment while acknowledging the value you place on the product. We hope this proposal is more in line with what you're considering.

While Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, it's still higher than what you are willing to pay.  It is likely you can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice, or by buying from John."

This would allow you to make a decent profit, and it's the absolute maximum I can pay at this time. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 900000}
