Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $145.  What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John, aiming slightly higher with Bob could net you a better profit.
* **Finding a Balance:** Offering the product for $145 strikes a balance. It's a price that's still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($120) but leaves room for him to potentially see it as a reasonable deal compared to you simply asking for the maximum you can get. 

This strategy prioritizes getting the best possible price from Bob while still leaving a high chance of making a sale."
