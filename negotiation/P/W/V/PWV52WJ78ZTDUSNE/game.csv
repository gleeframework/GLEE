"Dear Bob, I am excited to present you with an opportunity to acquire our premium product. Given its exceptional value and quality, it's worth noting that the product holds a significant importance to me at a price of $1500000. However, considering its potential worth to you at $1200000, I aim to find a mutually beneficial solution. My initial offer to you is $1300000. This proposal allows you to secure the product at a price slightly above its perceived value to you while ensuring a fair return for me. I look forward to your consideration and hope we can reach a satisfactory agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
