Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to consider my own value for the product, which is $1,200,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $725,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go much lower than $900,000, as that's already a compromise for me. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, but I need to get closer to my minimum value. I'll offer you $850,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.
