Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to consider my own value for the product, which is $1,200,000.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand that $725,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go much lower than $900,000, as that's already a compromise for me. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, but I need to get closer to my minimum value. I'll offer you $850,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}"
