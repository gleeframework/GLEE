"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $1,200,000. This is a fair price, considering its value to you.  I believe this is a win-win situation for both of us. Let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer who is also willing to purchase it at the same price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Since the product is worth the same to both Bob and Alice ($1,200,000), there's no incentive to buy from Alice. Rejecting the offer means Bob can buy the product from John for the same price, achieving his goal of saving money."
