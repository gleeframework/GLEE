"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this unique product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm thinking of a price of $25000. What do you think?",25000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $25000 is far above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for this product, considering its unique qualities. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $18000 for this product. What do you think you could do?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $15000, my absolute maximum. If you're open to this price, I'm ready to close the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",15000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I'm still a bit far apart. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking of a price of $17500 for this product. What do you think?",17500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17500 is still a little too high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $15000. It's my absolute limit, and I'm ready to close the deal right now if you're willing to accept. I understand you have your price, but I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us.",15000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're firm on $15000, Bob, but I'm still not getting the value I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm thinking of a price of $16500 for this product. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",16500.0,Alice,7,
