"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $20,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $10,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $17,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice.  $17,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value the product brings to me.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're willing to go up to $12,000, Bob. However, considering the value of the product and the time we've spent negotiating, I think we can do better than that. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,5,
