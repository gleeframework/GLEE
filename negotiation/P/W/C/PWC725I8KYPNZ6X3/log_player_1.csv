Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really find valuable. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer slightly higher than what you're ultimately willing to accept. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down a bit.
* **Close to Bob's Value:** Since the product is worth $120 to Bob, offering it at $115 leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring a significant profit for me.
* **Leaving John as Backup:** I'm not starting at $100 (John's offer) because there's a chance I can get a better deal from Bob. I can always fall back on John's offer if the negotiation with Bob doesn't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's considerably lower than both my minimum and his perceived value.  I believe there's room for negotiation. By rejecting his offer and providing a counteroffer, I can try to reach a price closer to my desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, $90 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. Would you consider meeting me halfway at $102?"", 
""product_price"": 102
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Showing Flexibility:** I'm acknowledging Bob's counteroffer and demonstrating a willingness to negotiate by moving significantly down from my initial price.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering $102 puts us very close to the middle ground between his offer ($90) and my initial asking price ($115). It signals fairness while still leaving me room to negotiate further if needed.
* **Maintaining Profitability:** This price is still comfortably above my minimum acceptable price ($100), ensuring a reasonable profit even if Bob accepts it outright."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not comfortable with $102. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** While not ideal, $95 is still above my minimum acceptable price ($100), ensuring a profit.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better outcome.  Bob seems anchored around the $90-95 range.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Prolonging the negotiation with Bob has the risk of losing John's offer altogether. It's better to secure a reasonable profit now than risk losing out completely."
