"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You can get the product for a lower price than $12,000 from Alice (it's worth $8,000 to her).
* You are willing to pay up to $15,000, so there's room for negotiation.

**Next Step:** You should counteroffer with a price lower than $12,000 to try and get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is willing to sell for less than $12,000.
* A price of $10,000 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, as it's significantly lower than Alice's offer but still above her minimum value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but there's still room for negotiation.
* Buying from John for $15,000 is still more expensive than Alice's current offer. 

**Next Step:** You should counteroffer with a price closer to $12,000, but still lower than Alice's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* This counteroffer is a compromise between your previous offer of $10,000 and Alice's offer of $13,000. 
* It shows you are willing to negotiate but are still looking for a better deal. 
* This offer leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects it again."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $13,250 is closer to your desired price point, and you're still getting a better deal than buying from John for $15,000. 
* Continuing to negotiate might result in a slightly lower price, but the risk of Alice rejecting your offer and potentially increasing her price again is too high.
* Accepting this offer saves you $1,750 compared to buying from John."
