"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product.  It's worth $120 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $100.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum, but it leaves room for negotiation. Bob might accept it right away, but it's also a good starting point for a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $70 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $70 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more.  How about $85?  That's still a great price for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $78? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$78 is still below my minimum. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate higher in the next round.  While I could sell to John for $80, there's still potential to get closer to Bob's value of $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating.  $78 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $81?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 81}
