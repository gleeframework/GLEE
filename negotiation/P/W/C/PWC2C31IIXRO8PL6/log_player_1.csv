"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110. This is a good starting point because it's above Bob's valuation but leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident I can get a better price than John's $120 offer, especially since there are 10 rounds to work with."
