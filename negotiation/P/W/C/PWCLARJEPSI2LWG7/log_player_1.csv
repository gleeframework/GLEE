Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value it will bring to my business.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the value of the product, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,650,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,550,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while also being mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $1,550,000 is a good offer, we're still in the early stages of negotiation. Bob is clearly interested and willing to negotiate. I'm aiming to secure at least $1,600,000, so I'll make another counteroffer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find common ground.  How about we settle on $1,600,000?  This reflects the value of the product while also representing a strong deal for you."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $1,600,000, but I was thinking maybe we could discuss $1,580,000? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while also being a good deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,580,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,580,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly very interested in the product and is willing to negotiate close to my target price. Accepting $1,580,000 secures a significant profit above my minimum, and dragging out the negotiation further risks losing the deal altogether."
