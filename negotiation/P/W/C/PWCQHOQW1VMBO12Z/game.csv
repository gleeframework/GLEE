"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe it's a bit steep at $850,000, and I'm not sure I can justify the cost.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $700,000 is a good offer, it's unfortunately below my minimum. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",775000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $775,000. How about we try $725,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it's a good investment for me.",725000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product. I'm willing to go down to $750,000, but that's my final offer. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're ready to close this deal.",750000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to walking away, but I'm still interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you at $725,000, but I need to be honest, I'm not sure I can go any higher. Can you think about it and see if there's any wiggle room?",725000.0,Bob,6,
