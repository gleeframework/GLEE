"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to secure this product for a slightly lower price.  Considering the value it holds for you, I believe $850,000 would be a fair price for both of us.  This would allow me to acquire the product without exceeding my budget while still providing you with a profitable sale.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After re-evaluating the market value of the product, I'm willing to consider a slightly higher offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to earn a significant profit while meeting your budget constraints.",875000.0,Alice,3,
