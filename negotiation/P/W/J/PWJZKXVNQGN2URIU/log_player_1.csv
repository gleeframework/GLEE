Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in.  I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation.  By offering $100, I'm hoping Bob will counter with a lower price, allowing me to still potentially sell the product for more than my minimum of $80.  It also signals that I believe the product has value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $100 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. How about $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $75 is better than my minimum, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I'd like to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $85? I'm confident you'll find this product is worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $85 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle on $80?  That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by rejecting and potentially needing to sell to John for the same price."
