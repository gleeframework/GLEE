""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it will be highly beneficial for you. I'm willing to let it go for $1,400,000.  This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it seriously."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **John's Guaranteed Price:** Alice is guaranteed $1,500,000 if Bob declines.

Alice should aim for a price significantly higher than Bob's valuation but below John's offer.  Offering the product at $1,400,000 creates a strong incentive for Bob:

* **Significant Profit Potential:** If Bob accepts, he could potentially resell the product for a profit later.
* **Sense of Urgency:** The ""one-time offer"" phrasing adds pressure for Bob to act quickly. 

By pricing high but not unreasonably so, Alice maximizes her chances of securing a deal with Bob at a price significantly above his initial valuation, while still retaining the safety net of John's offer."
