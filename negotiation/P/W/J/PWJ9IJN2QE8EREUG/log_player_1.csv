Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I make it available to other potential buyers. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to earn as much as possible. Knowing the product's worth to Bob, she starts with a price higher than his valuation and John's offer.
* **Negotiation Room:** The $15,000 offer leaves room for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and Alice can then decide to accept, reject, or counter again.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Alice has a safety net with John. If Bob rejects the offer, she doesn't lose out completely. This knowledge allows her to be more assertive in her initial pricing. 

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy. Alice could choose different approaches:

* **Start lower:** She could begin closer to $12,000, aiming for a quick sale.
* **Provide Justification:** Alice could explain the product's value to justify the higher price.

The best approach depends on Alice's risk tolerance and understanding of Bob's negotiation style."
