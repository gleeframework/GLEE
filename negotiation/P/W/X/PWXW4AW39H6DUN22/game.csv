"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $250. This is a great deal, considering its value is worth at least $150 to me. What do you think?",250.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $250 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $180 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",180.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $180. I appreciate your interest in the product! However, I'm still a bit hesitant to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $220. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",220.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $220 is still a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $200 for the product. Can you consider that?",200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $200 is still a bit above your budget. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $210. This is the lowest I can go while still making a profit. What do you think?",210.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $210 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $190 for the product. Can you consider that?",190.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $190 is still a bit above your budget. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $195. This is the lowest I can go while still making a decent profit. What do you think?",195.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $195 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $185 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",185.0,Bob,8,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $185 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $190, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'd be happy to finalize the deal.",190.0,Alice,9,
