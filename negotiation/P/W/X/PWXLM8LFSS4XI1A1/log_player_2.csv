"Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a good price, there's potential to save more. By rejecting the offer, Bob can make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price.  It's always a good idea to try and negotiate, especially when the maximum you're willing to pay is $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much as possible, so he's starting with a significant counteroffer.  $750,000 is a substantial drop from Alice's initial price, but still within the range where Bob might be willing to buy. This counteroffer allows for potential negotiation while still maintaining a good buffer below Bob's maximum price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $795,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $795,000 is a good compromise. It's closer to Bob's counteroffer of $750,000 and represents a significant saving compared to the initial price of $850,000.  It's also considerably lower than buying from John for $1,000,000. Accepting this offer is the most logical choice, securing the product at a favorable price."
