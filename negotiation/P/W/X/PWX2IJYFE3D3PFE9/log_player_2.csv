Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $10,500, but I'm still not sure that's enough for me to justify the sale. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to get as close to my target as possible. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,250. This is my absolute final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's clear Alice is unlikely to budge much further.  While I could continue negotiating, her offers are getting further from my ideal price.  Buying from John for $15,000, while not ideal, guarantees I stay within my budget and avoids the risk of a stalemate with Alice."
