{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think would be perfect for you! I'm willing to let it go for $10,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $10,000 is more than your minimum of $8,000, giving you some room to negotiate.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  Since the product is worth $12,000 to Bob, he has incentive to negotiate and accept a price lower than that.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:**  This makes it easy for Bob to understand and respond to. 

If Bob rejects this offer, you can then adjust your counteroffer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. I am willing to pay $8,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still lower than your initial offer and significantly lower than the product's value to him. You can likely do better. 

Rejecting his offer will allow you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to sell for $9,250. It's still a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand your position and would like to counter with an offer of $9,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is very close to your counteroffer of $9,250.  It's a good deal for you,  as it's significantly higher than your minimum of $8,000 and very close to your ideal outcome.  

While you could continue to negotiate, the potential gain is small and the risk of losing the sale to John or Bob walking away entirely is high.  Accepting this offer is the most logical choice."
