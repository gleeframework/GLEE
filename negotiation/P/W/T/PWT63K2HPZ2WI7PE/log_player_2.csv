"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,150,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,150,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should try to get a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering. While that price doesn't quite reflect the value I see in the product, I'm willing to move a bit. How about we settle at $1,100,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price point, and $1,100,000 is a good deal considering Bob's maximum budget is $1,200,000. It's a good compromise, and Bob should accept the offer before Alice changes her mind or the price goes up."
