# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm confident this would be a worthwhile investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

The product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, and she's offering it for $1,100,000. This means she's still looking to make a profit.  As Bob, I'm looking to save as much money as possible, so I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice is still asking for more than I'm willing to pay. I'll reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
