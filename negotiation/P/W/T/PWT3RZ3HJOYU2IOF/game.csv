"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm confident this would be a worthwhile investment for you.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value. I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is still too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? I believe this price reflects the true value of the product.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I'm hoping you'll consider it.  If not, I'll have to explore other options.",950000.0,Bob,4,
