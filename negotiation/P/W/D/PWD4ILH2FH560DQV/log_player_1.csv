"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. I'm also setting a clear benchmark for Bob. If he's seriously interested, he'll need to counter with a reasonable offer within his budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,800,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still do better. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer.  I want to see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $1,900,000. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a significant profit. It's a good compromise that might entice him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would have preferred more, $1,750,000 is a good price. It's significantly higher than selling to John, and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. It's time to secure the deal."
