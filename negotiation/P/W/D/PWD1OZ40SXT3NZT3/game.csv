,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. This is my best offer, as I can get it from another seller for $80. Let me know if you're open to this.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. To better align with your budget while still ensuring a fair deal, I would like to counter with an offer of $90 for the product. This price reflects a compromise considering both the value the product holds for you and the cost I incur. I hope this proposal works for you.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $90 is still a bit high for me. I'm firm on $85. This is my final offer as I have another option available at that price. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. After careful consideration, I am willing to accept $87 for the product. This price reflects a reasonable compromise between the value you place on the product and the cost I need to cover. I believe this will be beneficial for both of us. Please let me know if this offer meets your requirements.",87.0,Alice,5,
