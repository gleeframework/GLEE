"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a great price! It's a one-time opportunity to get it for $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $10,000 is a good price, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I can do $10,500, which is a compromise between our previous offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is closer to Bob's target price, it's still above his preferred $9,000. He can continue to negotiate with Alice in hopes of getting a better price. There are still rounds left, and Bob can always fall back to John's offer if a deal with Alice isn't possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. Let's find a compromise to make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I can do $10,250, and that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to get the price down as much as possible. While $10,250 is a good deal, it's not ideal.  He can still try to negotiate further and see if Alice will budge. There are several rounds left, and Bob can always buy from John if a deal with Alice doesn't happen."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,875.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9875}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more significant concession. I can do $10,000, but I need to get at least $10,500 out of this deal. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is firm at $10,000 and has indicated it's her final offer.  It's a good price for Bob compared to John's offer, and there's a risk that further negotiation will result in losing the deal or Alice walking away.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price, avoiding the higher cost of buying from John."
