"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me there?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $9,000 is a good starting point,  I'm still hoping for a price closer to $11,000 to make this deal work for me.  Would you be willing to consider that?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit far from $11,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle.  I'm still hoping for a bit more, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $10,500?  That would be a fair deal for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go above $10,000. I'm still interested in the product, but I think $10,500 is a bit too rich for my blood. How about we stick with my previous offer of $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to come down a little bit more.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,250?  That's a fair compromise, and it would make this deal happen. Let me know what you think.",10250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $10,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $9,500? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",9500.0,Bob,8,
