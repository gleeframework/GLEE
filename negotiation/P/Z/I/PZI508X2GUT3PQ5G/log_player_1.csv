"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm ready to offer you $12,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is quite a bit below my bottom line. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $13,000, but I'm still not quite there. Let's split the difference and settle on $12,500. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
 
While I could push for more, accepting $12,500 is a solid win. It's significantly more than my minimum ($10,000) and keeps the negotiation moving quickly. There's always a risk Bob will walk away if I push too hard."
