"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to make sure it's within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and see your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and go with $950,000? This gives us both a good deal, and we can move forward quickly.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $925,000. Can we try to find a compromise?",925000.0,Bob,4,
