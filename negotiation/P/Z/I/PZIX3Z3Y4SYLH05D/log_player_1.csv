""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the substantial benefits it offers.  Let me know your thoughts."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I think $1,800,000 is a more suitable price. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is a significant jump in the right direction, but it's still too far from my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to guide him closer to a price that reflects the product's value to me."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. It's clear you recognize the value of this product.  While $1,800,000 is closer to a reasonable figure, I'm aiming for something a bit higher. How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000?  I'm confident this price represents a fair deal for both of us."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above $1,800,000. How about we try $1,900,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

We're getting close, but I still have some room to negotiate. Accepting $1,900,000 would be leaving a significant amount on the table compared to my minimum and John's offer.  I need to see if Bob is willing to go a little higher."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. $1,900,000 is close, but I need to land somewhere that truly reflects its value. Let's settle on $1,975,000. It's a strong offer, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,900,000 and $1,975,000. How about $1,925,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,925,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is clearly committed to reaching a deal and is incrementally increasing his offer. While I could potentially push for a bit more, accepting $1,925,000 ensures I secure a significant profit above my minimum and avoid the risk of dragging out negotiations further."
