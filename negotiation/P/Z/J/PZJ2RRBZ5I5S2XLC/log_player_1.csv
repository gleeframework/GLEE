"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $14,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This is a reasonable starting point. It leaves some room for negotiation while still getting a good price.  I've also included a message that is friendly and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $12,500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm not willing to sell for that price, and I'm confident I can get a better offer in the next round.  I'll counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're interested. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,500 is still below my minimum.  How about $13,500? I think that's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit higher than where I want to be. How about $13,000?  That's a fair compromise and a good price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. It's also a good compromise and a reasonable price given the product's value to him. I'll accept his offer."
