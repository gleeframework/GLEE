Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $100, which is the lowest I can go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100

Alice has met my bottom line. There's no point in continuing to negotiate or buying from John at the same price."
