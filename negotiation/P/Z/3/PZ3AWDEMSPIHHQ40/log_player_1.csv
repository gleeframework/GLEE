Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can't justify spending $13,000 on this product. Given its value to me is around $12,000, I would like to propose a price of $12,000 to purchase it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.
