"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'll be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm starting with a price of $15000.  I'm confident that this product will be a valuable asset for you. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $15000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $10000 for it, which is still a great deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12500.  This would still leave room for you to profit from the product, and it allows me to maintain a fair value for my work. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $12500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $11000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. Let's meet in the middle.",11000.0,Bob,4,
