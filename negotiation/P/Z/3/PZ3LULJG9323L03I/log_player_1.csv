"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I agree this product has potential, but the price needs to be more realistic. I'm willing to offer $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value and the return you'll see from it. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,300,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but that price is still too high for me. I can do $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly below John's offer.  It's time to push Bob a bit more to see how serious he is."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for staying engaged.  I've considered your offer carefully, and to be candid, $950,000 is cutting it close to my bottom line. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, but that's my absolute best offer."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Strong Stance:** By presenting $1,200,000 as my ""best offer,"" I'm signaling that I'm firm on this price.  This could encourage Bob to accept if he's truly interested.
* **Matching John's Offer:** This ensures that even if Bob rejects and I go with John, I haven't left money on the table. 
* **Urgency:**  By round 5, introducing a sense of urgency is crucial. Bob needs to understand this is a serious offer, and I have other options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving a little. To be honest, anything over $1,000,000 and I might as well go with a different vendor.  My final offer is $975,000.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Final Offer:** Bob has signaled that $975,000 is his absolute limit. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing negotiations with Bob carries the risk of losing John's guaranteed offer.
* **Minimal Gains:** The potential profit from continuing with Bob (even if successful) is now outweighed by the risk of losing a sure $1,200,000. 

It's time to cut my losses with Bob and secure the guaranteed profit with John."
