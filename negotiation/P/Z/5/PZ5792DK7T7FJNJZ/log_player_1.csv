{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love. I'm asking for $14,000, which is a great deal considering its value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:** Maintaining a friendly tone can encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I mention the product's value to make it seem like a good deal. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By starting with a price that's not my absolute minimum, I can potentially get closer to my desired $15,000.

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I'll adjust my strategy:

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've successfully sold the product for a good price.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter with a lower price, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate you considering my budget.  However,  $14,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $12,500 is still significantly below my minimum of $15,000.
* **Potential for Higher Counteroffer:** I believe I can likely get a better price by rejecting his offer and counter-offering. There's still room for negotiation, as Bob has shown interest and is willing to pay more than his initial perceived value of $12,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed outcome, I'm willing to take a calculated risk to potentially get closer to that amount. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll send Bob a counteroffer that is higher than his offer but still below my minimum.  I want to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This still gives you a good deal on the product and is closer to my minimum. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's exactly in the middle between my last offer ($14,000) and Bob's offer ($12,500). This shows a willingness to compromise. 
* **Reinforcing Value:** I'm again highlighting the value of the product to remind Bob that he's getting a good deal. 
* **Maintaining a Friendly Tone:**  Keeping the tone friendly and positive helps maintain a good relationship during negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've successfully sold the product for a price closer to my desired goal. 
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll need to evaluate his counteroffer carefully.  I may be willing to come down a bit further, but I won't go below my minimum of $15,000. 
* **If Bob rejects and I can't reach an agreement:** I'll move on to John and sell the product to him for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I can finalize the purchase right away. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $13,000 is only $2,000 below my minimum of $15,000.  This is a good outcome considering the negotiation process.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation or potentially losing the sale to Bob entirely.
* **Time Factor:** Bob's willingness to finalize the purchase right away suggests a sense of urgency, which might make it less likely he'll make a higher counteroffer in the future.

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale, earning $13,000 for the product. While it's not my ideal price, it's a reasonable outcome and avoids the risk of a longer negotiation or losing the sale completely."
