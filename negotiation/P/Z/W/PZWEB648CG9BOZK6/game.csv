"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $9000 for it.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $12500. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12500 is still outside my budget. I'm sticking with my offer of $9000. It's the most I can afford at this time.  Let me know if you're willing to come down to that price.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still interested in the product, but $9000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $11000. This is my final compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $11000.  I'm still very interested in the product, but I'm really at my limit.  Could you do $10500?  I'm hoping we can find a way to make this work.",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I need to make a living, and $10500 is still a bit too low for me. I can offer it to you for $11500. This is my absolute final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,7,
