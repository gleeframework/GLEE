Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. I know this is a valuable asset for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $900,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Focus on Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob to encourage him to consider a higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm making it clear I'm open to negotiation, giving Bob room to counter-offer.
* **Plan B:**  I'm aware that John is willing to pay $1,000,000, so I have a fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $700,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, it shows he's interested. I can likely get a higher price through further negotiation.
* **John is a safety net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $1,000,000 gives me the leverage to hold out for a better offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $700,000 is a good starting point, it's unfortunately below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which reflects the significant value this product holds for you.  Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but making a counter-offer to keep the negotiation going. 
* **Middle Ground:** My counter-offer of $850,000 is a compromise between my desired price and Bob's offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value the product offers him, hoping to encourage him to consider a higher price.
* **Openness:** I'm using language like ""Let's find a price that works for both of us"" to show I'm open to further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $850,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** $775,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, even though it's closer than Bob's previous offers. 
* **Negotiation continues:** Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with another counter-offer.
* **John is the safety net:** I have a solid backup option in John, which gives me the leverage to hold out for a better offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $775,000 is still quite a bit below the true value of this product. To show my willingness to compromise, I'm willing to go down to $825,000. This price reflects a fair balance between our needs and allows for both of us to benefit from this transaction.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 825000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by moving closer to Bob's offer, but still remaining above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to Bob, subtly reminding him that my price is still fair.
* **Fairness:**  I'm framing the price as a ""fair balance"" to make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm asking ""What do you think?"" to keep the conversation open and encourage further negotiation."
