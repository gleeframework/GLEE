"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $700,000 is a good starting point, it's unfortunately below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which reflects the significant value this product holds for you.  Let's find a price that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $850,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $775,000 is still quite a bit below the true value of this product. To show my willingness to compromise, I'm willing to go down to $825,000. This price reflects a fair balance between our needs and allows for both of us to benefit from this transaction.  What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
