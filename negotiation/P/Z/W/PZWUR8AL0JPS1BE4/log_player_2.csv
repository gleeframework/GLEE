Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $15,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle. How about $14,000?

Round 5

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $13,500, which is a significant concession on my part. Let's bridge the gap and finalize this deal.

**Reasoning:**

Alice seems stuck at a price point that's not beneficial for you. She's gone down, but very slowly.  At this rate, it's unlikely she'll reach a price close to your $10,000 limit. You can get the product for your ideal price from John, so it's time to cut your losses with Alice."
