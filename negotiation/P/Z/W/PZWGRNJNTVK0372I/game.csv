"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is well above my budget. I'm interested in finding a fair deal - would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value while still offering you a strong return on your investment.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we need to find a price that works for both of us.  While I understand it's valuable, $1,900,000 is still too high for me.  I can go up to $700,000, but that's my limit for this round.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've been considering the value this product brings, and I'm willing to make a significant adjustment to find common ground. Let's try $1,500,000. I believe this is my final offer, as it reflects the absolute lowest price I can justify.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
