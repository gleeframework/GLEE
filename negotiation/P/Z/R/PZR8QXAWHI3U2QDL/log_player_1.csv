"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, $18,000, to gauge Bob's interest. This gives me some room to negotiate downwards if needed. I'm also keeping in mind the value of the product to me ($12,000) and the potential of selling to John as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below what I'm aiming for.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16500}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $16,500, showing a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a profit. This is a reasonable compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, and could be a sweet spot to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has come up to $15,500 which is closer to my target price. It's not ideal, but I'm getting a decent profit and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John. It's time to accept the offer and close the deal."
