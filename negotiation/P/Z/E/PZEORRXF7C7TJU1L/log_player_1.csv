Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, it's worth attempting to get a higher price from Bob first.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $1,450,000 is still significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). However, it leaves me room to negotiate downwards slightly if needed while still securing a significant profit. 
* **""Exclusive Opportunity""**: This phrasing adds a sense of urgency and value, potentially making Bob more inclined to consider the offer seriously."
