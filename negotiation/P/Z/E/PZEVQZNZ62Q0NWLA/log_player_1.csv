Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob is willing to pay significantly more than your minimum acceptable price. Aiming high initially allows room for negotiation and maximizes potential profit.
* **Strategic Starting Point:**  Starting at $1,350,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down while still ensuring Alice gets a price significantly higher than John's offer. 
* **Gauge Interest:** The message is designed to be open-ended and invite a response, allowing Alice to gauge Bob's level of interest and adjust her strategy if needed."
