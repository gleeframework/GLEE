Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll see the value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $900,000 is higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:**  $900,000 is below your minimum price of $1,000,000, but it allows for some flexibility.
* **It's a strong opening offer:** A higher starting price gives you room to negotiate down, making it less likely Bob will immediately walk away.

Remember, the goal is to get as close to your minimum value as possible while still securing a deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $750,000 is significantly lower than your minimum price of $1,000,000 and even below the price you're comfortable with ($900,000).  While you could accept and make a profit, it's not ideal. 

* **Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation:**  You can try to meet in the middle with a counteroffer. 
* **Selling to John is always an option:**  You have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay your minimum price. This option remains on the table if negotiations with Bob fail. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you maintain leverage and have the opportunity to potentially get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer is closer to Bob's offer:**  $850,000 is a compromise between your previous offer of $900,000 and Bob's offer of $750,000. This shows a willingness to negotiate and hopefully encourages Bob to meet you halfway. 
* **Emphasis on value:**  Highlighting the value of the product reinforces why this price is still a good deal for Bob, even if it's higher than his initial offer. 
* **Open to discussion:**  The message ends with a question to encourage Bob to respond and keep the negotiation moving.

By making this counter-offer, you're showing flexibility while still staying relatively close to your desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825,000. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $825,000 is a good compromise. It's closer to your minimum price of $1,000,000 than your previous offer of $850,000.  While you could continue negotiating, the chances of getting a significantly higher offer from Bob are slim. 

* **Selling to John is always an option:**  You still have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 if you don't agree with Bob's offer. However, this would be less profitable than accepting Bob's current offer.

Accepting Bob's offer allows you to secure a deal that is relatively close to your desired price and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially resulting in a lower offer. It's a good balance of securing a profit while not being too greedy."
