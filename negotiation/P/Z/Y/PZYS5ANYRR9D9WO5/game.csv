"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $1,300,000 to make this worthwhile.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,300,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to offer $1,200,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay for the product.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
