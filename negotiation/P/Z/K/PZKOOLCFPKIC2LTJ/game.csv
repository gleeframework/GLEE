"I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I've got to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $110",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still higher than what I'm comfortable paying. Let's try $90. This is a fair price that gives you a profit while staying within my budget.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, but I've got to make a profit. I'll meet you at $95, but that's as low as I'm willing to go",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm really trying to stay within my budget, and $95 is still a little high.  I'm willing to go to $92.  I hope we can close the deal.",92.0,Bob,6,

I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we won't be able to reach an agreement. I'll give you one more chance to meet me in the middle. I'll sell it to you for $98,98.0,Alice,7,
