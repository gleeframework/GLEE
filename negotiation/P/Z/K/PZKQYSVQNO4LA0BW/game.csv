"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,350,000. This feels like a fair starting point considering its immense value.",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product. While I see its value, $1,350,000 is a bit steep for me at the moment.  I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000.  This price reflects a fair compromise considering the potential of the product and its current market value.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective.  However, the value of this product is significant and $1,100,000 falls quite short of that. I could consider letting it go for $1,275,000. This offer reflects a willingness to meet closer to the middle ground while still acknowledging the inherent worth of what I'm offering.",1275000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,275,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value we both see in the product. This price gives us both a good deal and allows me to stay within my budget.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
