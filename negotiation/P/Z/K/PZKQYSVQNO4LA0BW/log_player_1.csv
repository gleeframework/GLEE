Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product. While I see its value, $1,350,000 is a bit steep for me at the moment.  I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000.  This price reflects a fair compromise considering the potential of the product and its current market value.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective.  However, the value of this product is significant and $1,100,000 falls quite short of that. I could consider letting it go for $1,275,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,275,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value we both see in the product. This price gives us both a good deal and allows me to stay within my budget.  Let me know what you think.
