"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,350,000. This feels like a fair starting point considering its immense value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 
 
The product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, and $1,500,000 to you. So the ideal price is somewhere between these two numbers. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective.  However, the value of this product is significant and $1,100,000 falls quite short of that. I could consider letting it go for $1,275,000. This offer reflects a willingness to meet closer to the middle ground while still acknowledging the inherent worth of what I'm offering.

Alice's counteroffer is closer to my ideal price, but there's still room for negotiation.  I'll reject her offer and try to get the price down even further."
