Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing further."", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around  $600,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's offer is far too low.  I need to negotiate upwards significantly or take John's offer.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest.  I understand your perspective on the price, but $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities. To be fair, I could consider a price of $1,100,000.  This feels like a reasonable compromise."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  While I agree the product is good, $1,100,000 is still outside my budget.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere, say around $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
