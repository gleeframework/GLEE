Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm.  While I recognize the value of the product, $1300000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1250000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and it leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
