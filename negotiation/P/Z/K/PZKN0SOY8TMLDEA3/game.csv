"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm offering it to you for $1300000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1200000. I'm confident you'll love it!",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm.  While I recognize the value of the product, $1300000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1250000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and it leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept your offer of $1250000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1275000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1275000.0,Alice,3,
