"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$18,000:**  This price is a starting point that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It's important to start high to maximize potential earnings.
* **Message:** A friendly and enthusiastic message encourages Bob to consider the offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $10,000 for it. Would you consider accepting this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000. Accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss. While $15,000 from John is a guaranteed profit, it's worth continuing to negotiate with Bob. There's a possibility I can secure a better price than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $14,000 for this.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $14,000 is a compromise from my initial offer, but still well above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum value. 
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's stance but reiterate my own needs. This keeps the negotiation open while emphasizing my firm stance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I'm willing to increase my offer to $12,000. This is the highest amount I can realistically afford for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still below it.  I want to see if I can push Bob higher before resorting to John's offer. There's still a chance Bob might come closer to my minimum, especially since I've shown willingness to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a higher offer, but $12,000 is still not enough for me.  How about $13,500?  I'm sure you'll agree this is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm increasing my counteroffer to $13,500, which is halfway between Bob's offer and my previous offer. This shows I'm willing to meet him halfway.
* **Message:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and remaining positive while reiterating my need for a higher price. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'm willing to go up to $13,000 for the product. This is the maximum I can afford without compromising my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $13,000 is getting closer to my minimum value, it's still below my target. We've reached a point where further negotiations are unlikely to yield a significantly better price. With only four rounds remaining, it's more advantageous to accept John's offer. Selling to John guarantees a profit of $15,000, which is higher than Bob's current offer and my minimum value."
