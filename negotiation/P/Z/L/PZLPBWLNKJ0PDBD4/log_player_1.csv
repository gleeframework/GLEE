Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I make it available to other potential buyers. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you. I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, there's a chance to get a higher price from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 creates a win-win situation if Bob recognizes its value to him at $1,000,000. He saves $50,000, and I make a profit above my minimum. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The message hints at potential flexibility (""willing to part with it for"") without explicitly inviting a counter-offer. This allows Bob to accept the price or potentially propose a slightly higher one."
