Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  Here's why:

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to earn as much as possible, so aiming high is the best strategy. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a risk that Bob will reject the offer.  However, if he does, I have a guaranteed sale to John for $12,000.  The potential $3,000 profit outweighs the risk.

**Key Considerations:**

* **Bob's Value:** I have no information about Bob's perceived value of the product. This offer is a calculated gamble based on the potential for a higher profit.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  If Bob counters with a lower offer, I can still negotiate to try and reach a mutually agreeable price."
