```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway though. How about $12,500? It's still a great price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject the offer. While $12,500 is closer to his maximum budget, it's still more than he wants to spend. He has the option to buy from John for his desired price, so there's no need to accept this offer yet."

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. However, $12,250 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $12,375 as a final compromise. This is a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,375.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,375
