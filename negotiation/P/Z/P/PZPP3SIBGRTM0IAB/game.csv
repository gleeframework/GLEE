,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $75 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit though. How about $125? Let's find a price that works for both of us.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $125 is closer, but still a bit out of my price range. Could you do $90?",90.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $90 just isn't going to work for me. I'm willing to come down to $100, which is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Alice,5,
