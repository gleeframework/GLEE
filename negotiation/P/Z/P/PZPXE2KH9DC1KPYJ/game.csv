"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which still gives you a good deal while allowing me to make a reasonable profit. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle at $1,025,000. This feels fair to both of us, and would allow me to move forward with the purchase.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
