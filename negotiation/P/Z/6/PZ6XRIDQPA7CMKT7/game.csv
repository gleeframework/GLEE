"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is a bit too high for me.  Given my budget, I can offer you $850000 for the product.  This price is fair and reflects the value I place on it.  Let me know if this works for you.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850000 simply doesn't meet my needs.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to see a price closer to my original offer.  I'm offering you the product for $1100000.  Let's work towards a deal that benefits us both.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to offer you $950000.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950000 is still too low for me.  I'm prepared to go as low as $1050000, but that's my final offer.  It's a great price for a valuable product, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
