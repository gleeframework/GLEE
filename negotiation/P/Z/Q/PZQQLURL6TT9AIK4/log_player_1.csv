We're still significantly above Bob's perceived value and have room to negotiate. We're getting closer to a potential deal, but holding firm for now keeps the option of a higher price on the table."

It's time to walk away from Bob.  Bob is very unlikely to go above his perceived value of $800,000 and we've reached a point where the increments are getting smaller. Holding out for more from Bob risks losing a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
