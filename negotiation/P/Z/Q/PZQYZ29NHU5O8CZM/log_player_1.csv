"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $11,500. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $10500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can still squeeze a bit more out of the negotiation, especially since he is clearly interested. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest,  $10,500 is a bit too low for me at this point. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $10750. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to my minimum, but I still believe I can get a better price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my previous offer.  Even though I'm getting closer to John's offer,  I'm not quite ready to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price.  $10,750 is still a bit lower than where I need to be.  Let's split the difference - how about $10,875?  I'm trying to be fair here."", ""product_price"": 10875}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10500, and I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum.  We're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds and I'm concerned I might not be able to get a higher price.  John's offer is guaranteed, and while it's less than I'd like, it's still a good deal.  I'm going to take the safe option and sell to John."
