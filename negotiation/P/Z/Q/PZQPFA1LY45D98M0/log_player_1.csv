Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as it is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $100, but leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is my minimum, I believe the product is worth more and I want to see if I can negotiate a higher price.  I'm willing to take the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially getting a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm going to counter with $120. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground and reach a deal that is fair for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $110 is still a good deal for me.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob as a buyer and potentially ending up with the same price from John. It's better to secure the sale at a price that is still above my minimum."
