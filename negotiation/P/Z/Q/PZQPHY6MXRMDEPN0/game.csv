"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180.",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $180 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. I'm willing to pay that price for the product.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $160. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not sure I can stretch to $160. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $140. Can you consider that price?",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about we say $155? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll love the product.",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $150, but no more. Can you meet me at that price?",150.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really close to making a decision, Bob! I'm willing to make one last concession. I'll meet you at $152. It's a great price for a fantastic product, and I think you won't regret it.",152.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your last concession, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $152. I'm willing to go up to $149, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",149.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really trying to get a good deal, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I get a good price for the product. I'll meet you at $148, and that's as low as I can go. After that, I'll have to consider other options.",148.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $148, Alice, but I'm still not sure I can justify spending that much. I'm willing to go up to $145, and that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",145.0,Bob,10,
,,Alice,10,RejectOffer
"I've already said I'd go as low as $148, Bob. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider other options. I'm not sure I want to sell to you at $145 when I've already offered you a better deal.",148.0,Alice,11,
