Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to close the deal quickly, $7,500 is significantly below my minimum value. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $7,500 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $9,000? That's still a good deal for both of us, and keeps the negotiation moving."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $7,500. How about $8,200? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really think that's the most I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,200 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'll see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I'm willing to keep negotiating. However, $8,200 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $9,500, which is a fair compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to save a bit more. How about $8,500? I'm willing to meet you halfway on the compromise, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is tempting, it's still not where I want to be. I'm willing to keep negotiating and see if I can get closer to my goal. I think I can still push for a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to run out of time here, so I really need to make sure we reach a fair price.  I'm willing to go down to $9,200, but that's my final offer. If you can't meet me there, I may need to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 9200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway on the last offer, so how about $9,100? I'm really hoping we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While $9,100 isn't ideal, it's a good compromise and getting closer to my minimum value.  It's also better than selling to John and missing out on the potential of potentially getting a higher price in the next round."
