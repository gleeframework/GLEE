"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm asking for $170 for it, but I'm open to negotiating a bit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 170}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, but still within a reasonable range considering Bob's perceived value. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm indicating flexibility to encourage Bob to counteroffer and start the negotiation process. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and optimistic to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $170 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $130 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $130 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Opportunity for negotiation:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a more reasonable price and hopefully reach a compromise.
* **Potential for a better deal:** While I can sell to John for $150, there's a chance I can get a better price from Bob through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $130 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $150? It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm sure you'll find it worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my minimum and Bob's offer.  This shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining my minimum price.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize the fairness of my proposed price.
* **Focus on Investment:** By framing it as an ""investment,"" I'm subtly shifting Bob's perspective to the potential benefits of the product, making it more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $150 is still too high for me.  How about $140? It's a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll still make a good profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  $140 is just $10 below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Limited time:** With only 6 rounds left, continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal with Bob and potentially missing out on a sale to John.
* **Potential for a better deal:** While I might be able to push for a slightly higher price, it's unlikely I'll get closer to my initial asking price. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a profit."
