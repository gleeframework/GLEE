"Hey Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $130 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $150? It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm sure you'll find it worth the investment.",150.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $150 is still too high for me.  How about $140? It's a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll still make a good profit.",140.0,Bob,4,
