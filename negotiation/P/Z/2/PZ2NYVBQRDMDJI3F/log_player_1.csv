Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Minimum Value:** I need to get at least $15,000 for the product, as I have a backup buyer (John) who is willing to pay that amount.
* **Potential Upside:** I am trying to maximize my profit by offering a price higher than John's offer. This is a calculated risk as Bob might reject the offer, but the potential reward is worth it.
* **Negotiation:** This offer leaves room for negotiation. Bob may counter with a lower price, which could be beneficial for both of us.

By offering $20,000, I am demonstrating confidence in the product's value while still leaving room for negotiation."
