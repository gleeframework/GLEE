"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product of exceptional value. Given its unique benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for us to discuss."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a strong offer slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) to leave room for negotiation while aiming for a high profit. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""exceptional value"" to justify the high price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrasing ""starting point for us to discuss"" signals my willingness to negotiate.

This strategy allows me to gauge Bob's eagerness and adjust my approach in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial asking price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to consider a purchase closer to  $900,000.  What are your thoughts on that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly below both my minimum ($1,000,000) and his perceived value. Accepting would mean a substantial loss compared to selling to John. While I want to maximize profit, accepting such a low offer in Round 2 could set a weak precedent for the rest of the negotiation. It's strategically better to counter and gauge his flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, your offer doesn't reflect the true value of this product. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it represents a fair deal."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Holding Firm:** I'm reducing my price, but staying above both my minimum and John's offer. This emphasizes the product's value and my determination to secure a strong price.
* **Concession Framing:** By stating it's a ""significant concession,"" I aim to make Bob feel he's getting a better deal and encourage him to move closer to my range. 
* **Simplified Message:**  I'm keeping the message concise to avoid appearing overly eager or revealing too much information."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  While $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to increase my offer to $975,000. I believe this demonstrates my seriousness about finding a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, signaling his interest. However, $975,000 is still below my minimum and John's offer. Accepting would mean losing potential profit. I'll counteroffer again, showing a willingness to negotiate but holding firm above my baseline. I need to signal that time is a factor, and John's offer is a tempting alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to reach a deal. However, we're still quite far apart. I'm willing to consider $1,050,000 as my final offer. It's a significant reduction, and I need to be mindful of other potential buyers who are interested at a higher price point.  Let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Pressure:** By presenting this as my ""final offer,"" I'm introducing a sense of urgency and signaling that I'm close to walking away.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Mentioning ""other potential buyers"" (referring to John) subtly reminds Bob of competition and strengthens my position.
* **Time Constraint:** Asking for a decision ""soon"" reinforces the time pressure.
* **Strategic Concession:** Reducing to $1,050,000 shows flexibility while still aiming for a price well above my minimum.

This approach aims to prompt Bob to make a serious move, either accepting this offer or countering with a significant jump. It positions me well for the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, and I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.  To bridge the gap, I'm proposing $1,000,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it accurately reflects the product's value while considering my budget.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches John's offer, meeting my absolute minimum price.  While I could try to push for more in the remaining rounds, there's a risk that Bob might walk away. Accepting now secures a guaranteed $1,000,000 profit. It's a strong outcome and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
