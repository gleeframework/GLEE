"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  The product is worth $8,000 to Alice, and she's offering it for $9,500.  This means there's room for negotiation. Bob wants to save as much money as possible, so he shouldn't accept the first offer.  He should try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit higher than I was hoping for.  I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $8,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I've already made a significant concession from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $9,000, and that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $9,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price.  While she has made a concession, it's not enough to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.  There's still room for negotiation.  Bob should reject her offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $9,000 is closer, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $8,500.  Would you be willing to meet me at $8,750?  It's a fair compromise that would allow us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I've already met you halfway and even dropped below my initial offer. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make a profit. I can do $9,200, and that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $9,200 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still significantly higher than what Bob wants to pay.  He should reject the offer and continue trying to negotiate a lower price.  Bob has 5 rounds left, and he can still save more money.  If he's not able to get a better price from Alice, he can always buy from John for $12,000 as a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating. I'm still hoping for a lower price, however,  I'm willing to meet you at $8,900. That's a compromise that's fair to both of us and allows us to move forward. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8900}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting close. However, I've already made significant concessions, and I need to make a profit. I can do $9,500, but that's as low as I can go. I'm starting to think we're at a stalemate. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is the same as her initial offer.  This suggests that she's not willing to go lower, and the negotiation is at a stalemate.  Bob has 3 rounds left, but it's unlikely that Alice will budge any further.  It's better for Bob to cut his losses and buy the product from John for $12,000, which is still within his budget.  While it's not the ideal price, it's the most sensible decision given the current situation."
