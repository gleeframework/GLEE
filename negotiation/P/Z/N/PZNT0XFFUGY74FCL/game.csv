"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I've already made a significant concession from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $9,000, and that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $9,000 is closer, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $8,500.  Would you be willing to meet me at $8,750?  It's a fair compromise that would allow us both to walk away happy.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I've already met you halfway and even dropped below my initial offer. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make a profit. I can do $9,200, and that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating. I'm still hoping for a lower price, however,  I'm willing to meet you at $8,900. That's a compromise that's fair to both of us and allows us to move forward. What do you think?",8900.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting close. However, I've already made significant concessions, and I need to make a profit. I can do $9,500, but that's as low as I can go. I'm starting to think we're at a stalemate. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,7,
