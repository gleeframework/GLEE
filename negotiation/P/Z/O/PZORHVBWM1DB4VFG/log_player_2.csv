"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a product that could be immensely valuable to your business. I'm confident it's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1,200,000. This reflects a significant discount from its true value, demonstrating my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's discuss this further and see if we can find a price that works for both of us.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective. While $1,000,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still significantly lower than the product's true value and what it can potentially bring to your business.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and while I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway, $1,050,000 is still a significant undervaluation of the product. It's important to consider the potential benefits this product can bring to your business, which far outweigh the proposed price.  I'm prepared to make one final concession and offer the product for $1,075,000. This reflects a compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's finalize this transaction and unlock the value this product holds for your organization.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. While $1,025,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, it still doesn't reflect the true value of this product.

This price bridges the gap between our positions and allows us to reach an agreement. Let's seize this opportunity to finalize this deal.
