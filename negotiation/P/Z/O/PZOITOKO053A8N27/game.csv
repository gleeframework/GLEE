"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. I think it's a great value, and I'm confident you'll appreciate it. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $9000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $7500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $9000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $8250. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8000, and I believe that's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in making a deal at that price.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $8000 is a great offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8250 and $8000, which would be $8125. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",8125.0,Alice,5,
