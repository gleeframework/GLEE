"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,500,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I still feel that $1,350,000 is out of my current budget.
