"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this product has great potential, but I need to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While $1,200,000 is a significant profit, I believe I can negotiate a better price with Bob. We are only in round 2, and I have leverage knowing the product's value to him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I believe $1,200,000 undervalues the product significantly. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,300,000?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,250,000. Would you be willing to consider $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is clearly willing to move towards my price point. While $1,250,000 is tempting, I think I can push for a bit more, especially with 6 rounds remaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're getting closer.  Let's wrap this up. How about $1,275,000 and we have a deal?"",
""product_price"": 1275000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I still think we can do better. How about $1,225,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

This is getting tricky. Bob is clearly anchored around $1,250,000. However, I'm not willing to go below $1,250,000. I'll make one final strong counter-offer before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your negotiation, but I need to be firm. My final offer is $1,260,000. This is a fantastic deal considering the value you'll gain from this product."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your firm stance, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,230,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,230,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,230,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

It's time to cut my losses. Bob is clearly unwilling to meet my price point, and with only three rounds left, the potential gains from continuing the negotiation are outweighed by the risk of getting even lower offers.  John's offer of $1,000,000 guarantees a significant profit and avoids further haggling."
