Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me.  How about $125?  Let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is still a bit low, but I'm willing to negotiate further. I'll see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is still a bit lower than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $132.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets this deal done."", ""product_price"": 132.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand you're trying to get a fair price, but $132.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $130.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is getting closer to my target price, and I don't want to risk losing him completely.  $130 is a good deal for me, and it's worth closing the deal now."
