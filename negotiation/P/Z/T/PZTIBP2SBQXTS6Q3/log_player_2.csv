"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $115. It's a steal, and I know you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay up to $100 for the product. Alice's offer of $115 is above your limit. It's better to reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice,  $115 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only offer $105. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum price of $100.  While you could continue negotiating, it's not guaranteed you'll reach a price you're comfortable with.  John is offering the product at your limit, so it's the most sensible decision to buy from him."
