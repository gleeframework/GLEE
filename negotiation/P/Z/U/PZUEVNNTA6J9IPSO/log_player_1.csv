"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, considering the product is worth at least $150 to me. I'm aiming to maximize my profit, but I also want to keep the negotiation going.  I'm not sure what the product is worth to Bob, so I'll see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $120. It's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150, and I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm going to try and counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm countering with $175. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing flexibility while still staying above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will entice Bob to come closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $150 is my minimum acceptable price. I've already reached the point where selling to John would yield the same amount. It's best to accept Bob's offer and close the deal, as there's no guarantee of a better offer in the future."
