"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll love it, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to let it go for $1200000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product looks great, but $1200000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $1050000 for it.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, but I'm not quite ready to accept $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we compromise at $1100000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1075000. This is a fair price that allows us both to reach a deal. If you're not willing to accept, I'll have to consider other options.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you at $1080000, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm hoping we can reach a deal",1080000.0,Alice,5,
