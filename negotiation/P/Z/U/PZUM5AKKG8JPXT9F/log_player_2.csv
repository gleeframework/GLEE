"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll love it, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to let it go for $1200000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You can always buy from John as a backup if the negotiation with Alice fails."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, but I'm not quite ready to accept $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we compromise at $1100000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your ideal price point.  You can try to negotiate further to see if you can get a lower price. If not, buying from John for $1,000,000 remains a viable option."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you at $1080000, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm hoping we can reach a deal 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is only $80,000 above your maximum budget and she's stated it's her final offer. While you can try to negotiate further, it's unlikely she'll budge much more.  Accepting her offer is the most financially sound decision, considering you can still save $20,000 compared to buying from John."
