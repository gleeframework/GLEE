"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $140 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",140.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $140 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $160, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $160 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $150? I'm serious about buying this product and this is the highest I'm willing to go.",150.0,Bob,4,
