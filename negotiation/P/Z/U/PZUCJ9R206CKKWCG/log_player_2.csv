"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have. I'm asking for $14,000 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than Alice's value:** This means there's room for negotiation.
* **You have a higher ceiling:** You're willing to pay up to $15,000, so you can afford to counteroffer without immediately resorting to John. 

By rejecting the offer, you can try to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to go down to $12,000? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:**  This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, showing you're serious about negotiating.
* **Room for compromise:** $12,000 is still higher than Alice's value, allowing for potential negotiation to find a price that works for both parties.
* **Polite and respectful:** The message maintains a friendly tone, encouraging continued dialogue."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $12,000.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise reached:**  Alice has moved closer to your desired price, and $13,000 is within your budget.
* **Further negotiation is risky:** Pushing for a lower price risks Alice walking away, forcing you to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate could drag the process out, and you might end up paying more in the long run. 

Accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a good price and avoids the potential downsides of continued negotiation."
