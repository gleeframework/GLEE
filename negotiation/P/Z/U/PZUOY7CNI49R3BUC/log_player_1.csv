Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $12,000. This is significantly less than the value to Bob ($15,000), but still leaves a good profit margin for me. It's a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate. 

I'm confident that Bob will counteroffer, as he values the product higher. This will allow us to negotiate and hopefully reach a price that is favorable for both of us. 

If Bob rejects my offer, I'll be prepared to negotiate further. If the negotiation drags on or Bob becomes too stubborn, I can always fall back on John's offer of $8,000. This ensures I won't lose out on a sale and still make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is a decent price and better than John's offer, I'm still aiming for a higher profit. I believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing the negotiation. Bob has already shown a willingness to pay more than $8,000, so there's still room for us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 

By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, I can potentially secure a price closer to my target of $12,000. This strategy balances the risk of losing the deal with the potential for a higher profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering with $11,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $10,000. 

This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate and meet Bob halfway, while still ensuring a decent profit for myself. It's a good strategy to keep the negotiation moving forward and increase the chances of reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $9,500 is only $500 less than my previous counteroffer.  It's a reasonable price, and I'm confident it's more profitable than selling to John for $8,000.  Accepting Bob's offer minimizes further negotiation risk and ensures a decent profit."
