"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $900,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.

While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle at $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $700,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

It's time to cut bait.  Alice is unlikely to go below $850,000 and you have a guaranteed offer from John at $800,000. Take the sure savings."
