"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $900,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle. While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle at $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $700,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make the deal.",850000.0,Alice,5,
