"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is better than $15,000, you can still do better. Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to try and get a lower price.  You can always buy from John for $8,000 if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's $12,000 offer, but it's still within your budget.  By offering $9,000, you're showing Alice that you're serious about buying the product but also that you're not willing to pay her full asking price.  This gives her room to negotiate while still allowing you to save money compared to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is closer to your budget than Alice's initial offer, you're still not at the point where it's worth accepting.  You can always go with John for $8,000, so rejecting Alice's offer keeps the negotiation open and lets you try to get an even lower price.  There's still room for Alice to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

You've shown Alice you're willing to negotiate and that you're not afraid to walk away. This counteroffer is a slight increase from your previous offer, showing you're flexible but still committed to saving money.  You're aiming for a compromise that's closer to your target of $8,000 while still keeping the deal attractive to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is within your budget and significantly better than John's price of $8,000.  While you could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will reject your next counteroffer, forcing you to buy from John anyway.  It's more advantageous to secure the product for a price you're comfortable with rather than risking further negotiation."
