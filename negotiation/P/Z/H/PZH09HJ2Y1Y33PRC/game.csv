"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you that I believe could be very valuable to your business.  I'm offering you this product at a price of $1200000.  It's a significant investment, but I'm confident it will generate a strong return for you. Let's chat about it further.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, my budget is quite limited. Could we discuss a price closer to $900000? I'm hoping to find a balance between quality and cost.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to be flexible, $900000 doesn't quite cover the value I've placed on this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $1050000?  This price reflects the exceptional benefits it offers and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, given my budget constraints, I would need to propose a price closer to $850000. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually agreeable solution.",850000.0,Bob,4,
