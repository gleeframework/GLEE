# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am offering you our premium product for $10,000. This is a high-quality item worth significantly more than its face value, and I believe this price reflects its true worth while also providing you with a substantial benefit. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a better price. You can counteroffer with a lower price, potentially starting around $8,500."

You're still $1,200 above your ideal price.  It's worth another counteroffer to see if you can close the gap."
