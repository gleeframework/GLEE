"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110, which is a good starting point considering my minimum acceptable price is $120. This leaves room for negotiation while still being a profitable deal for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $95. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120, it's still not profitable enough for me. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with a price of $105. This is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120 and leaves room for further negotiation. It's a compromise that shows I'm willing to work with Bob, but I'm also not willing to settle for a significantly lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is closer to his perceived value of $80, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm not willing to sell at such a low price, especially since I have the option of selling to John for $120. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $100. This shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profitable price for myself.  Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate, and this offer is closer to his perceived value. I'm hoping this will encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With Bob's offer of $85, we're getting very close to his perceived value.  However, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  Given that I have the option to sell to John for $120, I'm choosing to sell to John and end the negotiation with Bob. This ensures I receive my desired profit."
