"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth $150 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it's still above my target price of $150. I have 10 rounds to negotiate, so I'll try to get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down from your initial price, but $120 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a bold counteroffer to quickly signal that I'm serious about getting a good price. $100 is still above Alice's minimum, but it's a significant step towards my target price of $150.  This counteroffer allows for room to negotiate further if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110, which is still a fair price considering what you'll get out of this product.  Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is closer to my target price, I'm still aiming for a lower price. Since I have 9 more rounds, I'll continue to negotiate.  I'll make a counteroffer closer to my $100 target, hoping to meet Alice somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $105. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm eager to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a compromise by increasing my counteroffer to $105. This shows Alice I'm willing to negotiate and demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement. It's a  reasonable middle ground between my previous offer of $100 and her current offer of $110. I'm confident this offer is attractive enough for Alice to consider while still allowing me to potentially reach my target price."
