"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire [Product Name] at a special price. It's a valuable asset, and I believe it would be a great addition to your operations. While my bottom line is $1,200,000, I'm willing to consider your perspective and offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a significant discount, and I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. By rejecting her offer, you can move to purchase from John at a much better price."
