"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price that's above Bob's valuation but still within a reasonable range.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay more than his initial valuation, but I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $15,000 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $12000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum valuation of $15,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob for a better price, but I'm not going to settle for anything less than $12,000 right now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $8,500 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it gives you a significant discount. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $10000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my minimum valuation, I'm still not willing to settle for anything less than $10,000. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a better price if I continue to counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,500. This is a fair price that acknowledges your budget concerns while still allowing me to make a profit.  I believe this is a win-win scenario, and I hope you'll agree."", ""product_price"": 9500}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, and I'm happy to offer you $9250 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for you and the budget constraints I'm working with.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward.

I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a better price if I continue to counteroffer. I'm also aware that I have the option to sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not in a rush to accept Bob's offer."
