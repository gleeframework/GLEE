"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high with $1,000,000. It's a bold move, but I want to see if Bob is truly interested and if he's willing to pay a premium for the product. This will also give me a good starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $800,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for it just yet. I believe the product has value beyond that.  I want to see if Bob will raise his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000. This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, but it shows I'm willing to compromise while also indicating the product's value.  I believe this is a fair price that might convince Bob to come up a bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum.  While I'm getting a bit nervous, I'm going to hold out for a bit longer.  I'm hoping to get closer to $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

I'm offering $850,000. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still upholding the product's worth. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a good deal and come up a bit more, or at least accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is not budging. He's clearly trying to lowball me.  I'm running out of rounds and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a much lower price.  It's time to take the safe option and sell to John for $800,000.  It's not the best I could have hoped for, but it's still above my minimum."
