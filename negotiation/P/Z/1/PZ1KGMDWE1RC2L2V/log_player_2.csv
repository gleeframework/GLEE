# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a better price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is way out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is my maximum offer."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $10000 is far too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $14000. This is a good deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above my limit.  I'll try to negotiate further and see if I can get Alice closer to my desired price point.  I'm not ready to buy from John just yet, as I believe I can still get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. This is a fair offer, considering the value I place on the product and my budget limitations."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this. I'm willing to come down to $13000. It's still a significant profit for me, but I want to make this deal happen. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is getting closer to my budget, I'm still willing to negotiate further.  I believe I can still get a better deal, and I don't want to rush into a purchase that might leave me feeling like I overpaid."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $13000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let's close this deal.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $13,000 is getting closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to negotiate a lower price. I'm not desperate to buy from Alice, as John is a reliable alternative. I'll try one more counteroffer before potentially going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I truly appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement. My final offer is $12,750. This is a fair price, considering the value I place on the product and my budget limitations.  If we can't agree on this, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 12750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $13000, but this is my final offer.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives you a good deal.  I'm confident we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're nearing the end of the negotiation and Alice is holding firm at $13,000.  While this is closer to my budget, I'm unwilling to pay that much.  Given John's offer of $10,000, it makes more sense to go with him and save myself $3,000. I've tried my best to negotiate with Alice, but ultimately, John's offer is a much better deal."
