{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for your product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still allows me a decent profit, and it's a fair compromise. What do you think?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is my absolute maximum. If we can agree on this price, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
