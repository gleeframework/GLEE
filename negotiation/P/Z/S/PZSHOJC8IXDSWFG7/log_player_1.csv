"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a valuable piece, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, aiming to maximize my profit. 
* **Reasonable Offer:**  $1,100,000 is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price, making it more likely Bob will consider it. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for your product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $950,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  
* **Negotiation potential:** I still have 9 rounds to reach a more favorable agreement.  
* **John's offer:** While John is offering my minimum price, I want to see if I can get more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still allows me a decent profit, and it's a fair compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  My counteroffer is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's. This shows a willingness to compromise while maintaining a profitable price.
* **Focusing on the value:** I emphasize the fact that this price is still a decent profit for me, highlighting the value of the product.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** I keep the message friendly and open to further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is my absolute maximum. If we can agree on this price, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum:**  $1,000,000 is the minimum amount I'm willing to accept for the product.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I reject this offer, there's a chance Bob will walk away, and I might not get a better offer in the remaining rounds.
* **Time is a factor:**  We're already halfway through the negotiation process, and I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed sale.

While I would prefer to get closer to my target of $1,200,000, securing $1,000,000 is a good outcome considering Bob's initial offer and the limited negotiation rounds remaining."
