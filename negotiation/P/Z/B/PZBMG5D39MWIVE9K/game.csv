"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me there?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference at $10,000? That's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still not convinced that $9,500 is a fair price.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $10,500 for this product.  That's a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, which is my initial offer, but I'm willing to add a small concession. How about we meet at $9,250?",9250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer, but $9,250 is still too far below my minimum price.  I'm willing to make one final concession. How about we settle on $10,000? That's a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it ensures we both get a good deal.",10000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, but I'm still not willing to meet you at $10,000. I've done my research, and I believe the product is worth $9,500 to me. I'm willing to go up to $9,750 if you're willing to meet me halfway",9750.0,Bob,8,
