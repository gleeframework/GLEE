Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $90. I believe it's a great deal and would be very valuable to you."", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $90 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he wants to, but still ensures a significant profit for you.
* **Avoid Losing the Sale:**  Offering a price too close to $100 might discourage Bob, pushing him to reject the offer. 

This strategy aims to secure a sale at a price significantly higher than your backup offer from John while remaining attractive to Bob."
