"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, and I'm open to discussing this further. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and the fact that I'm ready to buy it now. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a significant gap from my initial asking price. This product offers immense value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This reflects its true worth while still offering you a competitive price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still outside my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000.  This would be a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us.  I'm confident this product will be valuable to me, and I'm ready to purchase it right now.  Let's make this happen.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
