Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and the fact that I'm ready to buy it now. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
