# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, and I'm open to discussing this further. What are your thoughts?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a significant gap from my initial asking price. This product offers immense value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This reflects its true worth while still offering you a competitive price.
