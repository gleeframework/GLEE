I'm starting with a price of $11,500. This leaves room for negotiation, while still ensuring I get more than my minimum price of $10,000.  Since Bob values the product at $12,000, there's potential for a deal that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, but I'm not willing to sell for that low just yet. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm raising the price slightly to $11,250. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, and hopefully, we can reach an agreement at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

While I would prefer a slightly higher price, Bob's offer is very close to my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. I'll accept his offer and sell the product for $11,050."
