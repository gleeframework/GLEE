{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  I'm confident it will be a great investment.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** Bob values the product at $800,000, so he might be willing to pay a little more.
* **It's lower than your minimum value:** This gives you room to negotiate and potentially reach a price closer to your desired $1,000,000. 
* **It shows flexibility:** By making an offer, you're demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.

**Remember, you can always walk away and sell to John for $1,000,000 if you feel Bob is not being reasonable.**"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  Would you consider $700,000?  I think that's a fair price that reflects its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than your desired price:** $700,000 is far below your minimum value of $1,000,000 and even less than your initial offer of $900,000.
* **Selling to John is a safer option:**  You can secure a guaranteed $1,000,000 by selling to John, which is closer to your desired price.
* **There's still potential to negotiate with Bob:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to counter with a higher price and see if you can bridge the gap. 

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to counteroffer Bob with a price that's closer to your desired value but still leaves room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  $700,000 is significantly below what the product is worth to me.  However, I'm willing to be flexible. How about $850,000? This is a fair compromise that gives you a good deal while still allowing me to earn a reasonable price. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a higher price:** This demonstrates your willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price closer to your desired value.
* **Show flexibility and compromise:** By offering $850,000, you're indicating a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Reiterate value and fairness:** Emphasizing the product's worth and the fairness of the offer could sway Bob towards accepting.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts your counteroffer, you've secured a price closer to your desired value.
* If Bob rejects your offer, you can consider another counteroffer or choose to sell to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you consider $750,000? That would make it much easier for me to commit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still significantly lower than your minimum value:**  $750,000 is still far below your desired $1,000,000.
* **Selling to John is a safer option:** You can guarantee a price closer to your minimum by selling to John.
* **There's limited room for negotiation:**  You've already compromised significantly from your initial offer. While you could counteroffer again, the risk is that Bob won't budge further.

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to carefully consider the risk of further negotiation. If you believe Bob is unlikely to increase his offer significantly, selling to John for $1,000,000 is the more secure option. However, if you're confident in your negotiation skills and believe you can get closer to your desired price, you can continue to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is simply too far below my minimum value.  I'm willing to make one final compromise.  Would you consider $800,000? This is my absolute bottom line, and it reflects the significant value this product offers. If you're truly serious about this deal, I believe this is a price we can both live with.  Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final compromise:** This is your last offer, aiming to bridge the gap while still holding firm on your minimum.
* **Emphasis on value:**  Reiterate the product's worth and how this price is a fair reflection of that value.
* **Strong closing statement:** The clear statement about your bottom line and the potential for a mutually beneficial deal can push Bob toward acceptance.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts your offer, you've secured a price that's closer to your desired value.
* If Bob rejects your offer, you will likely sell to John for $1,000,000, as further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a better outcome."
