"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  I'm confident it will be a great investment.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  Would you consider $700,000?  I think that's a fair price that reflects its value to me."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, which might encourage her to negotiate. However, it's still significantly below her valuation, leaving room for her to counter if she's willing.  Importantly, it leaves a substantial gap between our offer and John's price, allowing for further negotiation without risking exceeding our budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  $700,000 is significantly below what the product is worth to me.  However, I'm willing to be flexible. How about $850,000? This is a fair compromise that gives you a good deal while still allowing me to earn a reasonable price. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but her current offer is still above your alternative option with John. There's a chance to negotiate further and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you consider $750,000? That would make it much easier for me to commit."",
""product_price"": 750000
}
``` 

This counter-offer shows Alice we're willing to move closer to her price, but we're holding firm below our absolute limit. It keeps the negotiation open while still giving us room to maneuver if she rejects it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is simply too far below my minimum value.  I'm willing to make one final compromise.  Would you consider $800,000? This is my absolute bottom line, and it reflects the significant value this product offers. If you're truly serious about this deal, I believe this is a price we can both live with.  Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has met your maximum budget. There's no point in rejecting and risking her walking away, or trying to negotiate further when you can't go lower. This matches the price offered by John, so you're indifferent between buying from Alice or John at this point."
