"Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $11000.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $11000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price between $12000 and $15000. Let me make a counteroffer to you. I'm willing to sell the product for $13000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $13000, but that's still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12500. If you're open to that, we can finalize the deal.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I'm still not quite there, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price between $12000 and $13000. Let me make a counteroffer to you. I'm willing to sell the product for $12800. What do you think?",12800.0,Alice,5,
