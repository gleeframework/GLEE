"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This is a good starting point as it gives Bob room to negotiate, while still reflecting the minimum value of the product to me.  If he rejects it, I can lower my offer in subsequent rounds, but I'll be keeping a close eye on my 10-round limit and the potential of selling to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While I'm not thrilled about the low offer, it's too early to sell to John. I want to see if I can get a better deal from Bob. I will counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $18,000. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still aiming for a better price than Bob's initial offer.  If Bob rejects again, I'll have to weigh my options more carefully â€“ the possibility of selling to John for $15,000 is getting more tempting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $16,000.  This is a decent price and I'm running out of rounds.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, and I don't want to risk selling to John for the minimum price. This ensures I get a reasonable profit and closes the deal."
