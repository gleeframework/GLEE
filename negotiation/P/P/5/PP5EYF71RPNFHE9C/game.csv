"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but I have to consider my own needs. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $1,300,000. I think this is a fair price that balances our interests.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle at $1,150,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My counteroffer is $1,250,000. I think this is a fair price that still leaves room for both of us to make a profit.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I can appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and call it a deal at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,200,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. My final counteroffer is $1,220,000. I think this is a fair price that still gives us a good deal, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good return on my investment.",1220000.0,Alice,7,
