"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a reasonable starting point, given that the product is worth at least $100 to me and $100 to Bob.  I'm aiming for a profitable deal, but I also want to leave room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $90. It's too low for me.  While I want to sell the product, I can't afford to sell it for less than $100, as it would be a loss for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm countering with $110. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer. It still gives me a profit, but it also shows that I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $95. While it's closer to my minimum, I still prefer to aim for a higher price.  I'll continue negotiating in the hopes of getting closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm countering with $105.  This is a further compromise, showing that I'm willing to negotiate. It's still a profitable price for me, but it's getting closer to Bob's offer, which could lead to a quicker deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $102.  While I'd prefer to sell for a bit higher, this offer is a good deal for me. It's a bit more than what I would get from John, and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. Accepting this offer ensures I get a profitable deal before the time runs out."
