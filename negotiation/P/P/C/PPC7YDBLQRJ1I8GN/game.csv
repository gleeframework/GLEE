"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product.  It's valued at $1,500,000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it for $1,200,000. This represents a significant opportunity for you to acquire a high-value product at a competitive price. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I receive a fair price for this valuable product. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is still a significant discount from the value you place on the product, and it gives you a substantial opportunity to acquire it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I still believe we can find a price that suits both of us. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000 for the product. I hope this proposal will lead to a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to be flexible, but we need to find a middle ground.  I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000. This allows us both to achieve our goals. Let's work together to bridge this gap.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your efforts to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I still feel that $1,050,000 is beyond my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000 for the product. I hope this proposal will help us reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
