"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I believe it's worth $120 to you, and while I could sell it for $80 elsewhere, I'd rather give you the opportunity to have it. How about we split the difference and you get it for $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Here's why:

* **You value the product at $120.**  This means you're willing to pay up to $120 for it.
* **Alice is offering it for $100.** This is a good deal for you because you save $20 compared to buying from John.
* **Even though you could get it for $80 from someone else, that's not relevant to your decision.**  You only care about the best price you can get *right now*. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most financially beneficial choice."
