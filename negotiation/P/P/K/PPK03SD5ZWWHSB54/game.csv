"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,500 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $10,800. This is a great compromise that still allows me to make a decent profit while also being competitive.",10800.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  However, $10,800 is still a bit outside my budget. Would you be willing to settle at $9,800?",9800.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,500. This is the lowest I can go and still make a reasonable profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my original price.",10500.0,Alice,5,
