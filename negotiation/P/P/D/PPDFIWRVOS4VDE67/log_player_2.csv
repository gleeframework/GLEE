Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further and offer the product for $950,000.  This leaves room for both of us to be happy with the transaction.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
