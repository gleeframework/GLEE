"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $8,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make a deal!",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the product's value is important to you. While $8,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Could you do $7,500?  That would make it an easier decision for me.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $7,500 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to go down to $8,000. This is a final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Alice,5,
