"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me is $1,000,000 to you.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is significantly higher than your initial offer reflects. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. I believe this price point better reflects its true worth.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit far from $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me is $1,000,000 to you.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
