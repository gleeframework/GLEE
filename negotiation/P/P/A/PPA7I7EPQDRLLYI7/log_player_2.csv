"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a unique opportunity with a lot of value. I'm confident it will be a great asset for you. My initial offer is $1400000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your ideal price range. There's room for negotiation.  You can make a counteroffer and see if you can get closer to your desired price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value you see in this product. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by making a significant step down from Alice's initial price, showcasing your willingness to compromise while still remaining within your budget. This might encourage Alice to come down on her price as well."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a better price.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1200000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle. How about $1300000? This would still give you a good deal and allow me to make a fair profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still a bit high, but it shows she's willing to negotiate. It's a good sign that she's moving in the right direction. You can still attempt to get a lower price by making another counteroffer.  There's still room for improvement, and you don't want to settle too quickly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $1,250,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and it's a significant step closer to my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer continues to show a willingness to negotiate while still pushing for a lower price.  You're showing a commitment to finding a mutually agreeable solution, but also that you're not going to settle for anything too far from your target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. $1250000 is closer to my goal, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to compromise one more time. How about $1275000? This feels like a fair price that respects both our positions. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer and is now very close to your ideal price.  At this point, it's likely you won't be able to get a lower price from Alice, and it would be risky to continue negotiating, potentially leading to her walking away. Accepting this offer allows you to secure the product for a price within your budget and avoids the risk of buying from John at a higher price."
