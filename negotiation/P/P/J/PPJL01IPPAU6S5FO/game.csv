"Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a product worth at least $1,500,000 to both of us. My initial offer is $1,750,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know your thoughts.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,600,000. I believe this price is more in line with what I'm willing to pay for the product.",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value our potential partnership, $1,600,000 doesn't quite cover my desired profit margin.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,650,000. Let's see if we can find common ground on this price.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $1,550,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,525,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1525000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,525,000 is simply too low for me to accept.  Given our ongoing discussions and your clear interest, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  My final offer is $1,575,000. This price represents a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.  Let's close this deal and make this a win-win for both of us.",1575000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not convinced that $1,575,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000, which is the price I was originally offered by John, and I think it's a fair price for the product. I'd like to stick with this offer.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
