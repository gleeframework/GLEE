"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $1,000,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $900,000.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to spend closer to $900,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $950,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit high. Let's split the difference and go with $925,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits us both.",925000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $925,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product for $975,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",975000.0,Alice,5,
