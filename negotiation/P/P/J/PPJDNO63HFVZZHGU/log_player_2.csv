"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is a good starting point, but I can likely do better. There are 9 rounds left, and I want to maximize my savings.  Rejecting allows me to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $1,000,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $900,000.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to spend closer to $900,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. I want to see if I can push for a lower price.  Rejecting allows me to counteroffer again and potentially get closer to my target of $900,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $950,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit high. Let's split the difference and go with $925,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $925,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product for $975,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $975,000, which is getting close to my target of $900,000.  While I could try to push for a lower price, we're only a few rounds away from having to buy from John for $1,200,000. Accepting this offer saves me $225,000 compared to buying from John. It's a good deal, and it's better to secure the product now than risk running out of time and having to pay more."
