Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, but I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to try to get a better price by making a counteroffer in the next round."

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue negotiating, John's offer is higher and guarantees me my minimum.  Therefore, I will accept John's offer."
