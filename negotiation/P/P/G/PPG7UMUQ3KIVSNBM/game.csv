"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $22,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering my needs. Let me know if you're open to negotiating.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is quite a bit lower than what I can accept.  This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it can benefit you greatly. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $18,000 is still quite a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects my genuine interest in the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",11000.0,Bob,4,
