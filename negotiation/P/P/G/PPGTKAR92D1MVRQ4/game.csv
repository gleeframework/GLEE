"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $700,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This reflects the value it brings.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value of this product, but I have a budget I need to stick to. Could we possibly agree on $850,000? That's a significant investment on my end and reflects my strong interest.",850000.0,Bob,4,
