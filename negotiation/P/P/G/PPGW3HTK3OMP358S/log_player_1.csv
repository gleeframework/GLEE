Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I think the product is worth less than that. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and potential. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $750,000 undervalues the product significantly.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $925,000. This reflects a willingness to negotiate while still respecting the product's inherent value."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $925,000 is still above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 
At $875,000, Bob's offer is a strong gain over your alternative sale price to John ($800,000).  While there's a chance you could negotiate a slightly higher price, the risk of Bob walking away isn't worth it at this point."
