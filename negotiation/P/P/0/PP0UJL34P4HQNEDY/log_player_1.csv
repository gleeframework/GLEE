I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,000. This price is significantly higher than what the product is worth to him, but it's still below my minimum threshold of $15,000.  This allows for some negotiation space while still giving me a substantial profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my desired price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target. I will send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm counter-offering Bob with a price of $10,500. This is still a good deal for me, as it's above Bob's initial offer and closer to my desired price. I believe this is a fair compromise that could potentially lead to a successful sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my desired price, and it's becoming clear that we're too far apart in our valuations.  I'm going to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John and avoid further negotiation."
