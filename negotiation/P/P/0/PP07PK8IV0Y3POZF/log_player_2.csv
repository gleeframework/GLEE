**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is less than your maximum budget and John's price, it's still significantly higher than her valuation of the product ($1,000,000). There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal, which might prompt Alice to lower her price further."
