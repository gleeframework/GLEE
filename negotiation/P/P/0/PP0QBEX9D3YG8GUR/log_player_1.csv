"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you'll love. I'm asking for $140 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a fair starting point that allows for some room to negotiate while still giving me a profit of $20.  I'm also being friendly and positive in my message to build a good rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Could you consider reducing the price to $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to sell at that price just yet. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $125 is just a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $135.  This still gives you a great price for a high-quality product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm offering $135, which is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer. I'm still making a profit, but I'm also showing flexibility to encourage a deal.  I'm keeping the message friendly and focusing on the value of the product to continue building rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I think we're getting closer. Would you consider $130 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $130 is very close to my desired price and still ensures a good profit for me.  I'm happy to accept his offer and close the deal."
