"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for considering our product! We're excited to discuss the price with you. After reviewing our costs and market analysis, we're willing to offer the product to you for $18,000. We believe this is a competitive price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Alice's offer is significantly higher than both my budget and John's offer. It makes sense to negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is quite high for me. I'm interested in the product but I have a budget in mind closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. We appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, we're still not willing to sell the product for $10,000, as it's worth much more to us. We're willing to compromise and offer it to you for $14,000. We believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is coming down, but it's still above my ideal price and what John is offering. I'll try to negotiate a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  To be totally transparent, I can get a similar product elsewhere for $12,000. I'd prefer to work with you, but only if we can get closer to that number. Would you consider $11,000?"", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for being transparent about the market price. We understand your concerns, and we're willing to make another concession. However, we're not willing to go as low as $11,000. We're willing to offer the product to you for $13,000. This is our final compromise, and we believe it's still a good value considering the product's quality and features. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

This is a tough one, but Alice has said this is her final offer. While I could push for $12,000, there's a real chance she won't budge and I'll end up with John's offer anyway. Saving $1,000 is good, but it's not worth risking the entire deal."
