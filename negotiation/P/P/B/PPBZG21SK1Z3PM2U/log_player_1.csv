Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I really appreciate it.  However, $110 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $105?  I'm really interested in this product, and I think we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105.
