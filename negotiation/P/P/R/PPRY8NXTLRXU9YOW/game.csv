"Alice,  $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  While I see the value in this product, I'm only willing to go as high as $900,000 right now.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits of having it. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $900,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it allows for a mutually beneficial deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,100,000 is still a bit above your comfort zone, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession to reach a deal. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits of having it. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering $950,000. This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident it'll allow us to reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,6,

"Alice, I'm starting to think we might not be able to agree on a price. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to come down, I'll have to consider other options.",975000.0,Bob,8,
