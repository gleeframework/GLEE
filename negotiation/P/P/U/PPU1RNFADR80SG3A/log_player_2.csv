"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product!  I've priced it competitively at $18,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is far too high ($18,000) compared to your maximum budget of $8,000. It's important to start negotiating and see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I'm interested in the product, $18,000 is unfortunately out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it.  Let me know if that's something you'd consider."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts with a strong opening price that is within your budget. It also emphasizes that you are interested in the product and willing to negotiate.  This shows good faith while also establishing a clear starting point for negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below my bottom line for this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my maximum budget. There's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a better price.  It's important to stick to my budget and not rush into an agreement that doesn't benefit me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $14,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and closer to your needs.  Let's see if we can find common ground there."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to compromise while staying within your budget.  By offering $10,000, you're showing Alice that you're serious about buying the product but not willing to overpay. This approach keeps the negotiations moving forward and increases the chances of reaching an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To be honest, $10,000 is cutting it very close to my minimum. I can do $12,000, but that's my absolute final offer. It's a great deal for this product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is still above my budget, and I'm not confident I can get her lower.  Since I have the option to buy the product from John for $8,000, it makes more financial sense to do so.  While I would have preferred to close the deal with Alice, my primary goal is to save money, and buying from John achieves that objective."
