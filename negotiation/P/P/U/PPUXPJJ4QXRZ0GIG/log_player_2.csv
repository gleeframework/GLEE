Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a good deal for Alice, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. He can likely negotiate a better price or simply buy from John for a lower price."

I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. Let's try $925,000.  It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.

While $925,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum.  He should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  It's possible Alice might be willing to come down further, and even if she doesn't, Bob can always buy from John for $800,000."
