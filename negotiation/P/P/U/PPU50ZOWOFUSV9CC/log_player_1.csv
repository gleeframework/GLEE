"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's 50% higher than my minimum value. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secures a good price. I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $100 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm counteroffering with $120. This is still higher than Bob's offer, but it's a significant reduction from my initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate. I'm aiming for a price that's more likely to be accepted by Bob while still remaining above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now my minimum acceptable price, and I have a limited number of rounds left. Accepting his offer is the best choice to guarantee a sale and avoid the risk of losing the deal entirely."
