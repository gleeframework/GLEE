Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My minimum:** I know I can get $800,000 from John, so that's my baseline.
* **Bob's value:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so there's room for negotiation.
* **Splitting the difference:**  Offering $1,000,000 gives Bob a good deal (saving $200,000) and gives me a significant profit above my minimum.

This approach is a good balance between maximizing my profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
