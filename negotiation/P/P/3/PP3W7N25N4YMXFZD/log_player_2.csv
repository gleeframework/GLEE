"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds significant value. While I can't disclose the exact nature of the product, I can assure you it's worth at least $1000000 to me.  I'm willing to let you acquire it for a price of $1500000. This is a substantial discount given the potential value, and I believe it presents a fantastic investment opportunity.  Please consider this offer carefully.  If you choose not to purchase, I have another buyer lined up who's ready to pay $1000000.  I look forward to hearing your decision.
