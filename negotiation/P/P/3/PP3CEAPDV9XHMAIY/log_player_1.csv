"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a fairly aggressive opening offer, but it gives me some room to negotiate downwards if necessary. It's also important to remember that I have the option to sell to John for $150 if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $150 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  I'm hoping that Bob will realize he needs to offer more than my minimum price, and that I can close a deal closer to my initial $200 offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm countering with $175. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and I believe it's a reasonable price that could be acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $160 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $150.  It's also a decent improvement from his previous offer of $150. Given the limited rounds left, it's a good time to accept and secure a decent profit."
