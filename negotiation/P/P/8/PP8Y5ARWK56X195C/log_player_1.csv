Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal and would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $10,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since I know the product's value to Bob ($8,000) and my minimum acceptable price ($8,000), I want to start with a higher offer to see if there's room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By offering it at $10,000, I give myself space to potentially come down in price if Bob counters, while still aiming for a profit above my minimum.
* **Confident Presentation:** The message emphasizes the product's value and positions the offer as an ""opportunity,"" subtly encouraging Bob to consider it seriously. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. If Bob rejects it, I can always propose a lower price or ultimately sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
