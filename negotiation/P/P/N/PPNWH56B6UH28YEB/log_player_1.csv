"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting with my ideal price. I know it's ambitious, but it reflects the product's value to me. If Bob rejects, I'll have to be more flexible, but I'll aim for as much as possible in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is a decent offer, I'm holding out for more. I'll counter Bob and try to close the gap a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm dropping my price a little, but I'm still aiming for a profit. I believe $1,100,000 is a reasonable middle ground, and it's a good starting point for further negotiation."
