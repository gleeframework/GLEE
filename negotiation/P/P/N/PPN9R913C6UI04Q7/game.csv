,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $900,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a good deal for you since it's worth $1,000,000 to you.  Let me know if you're interested.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $950,000 is still below my minimum. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $975,000. It's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",975000.0,Alice,5,
