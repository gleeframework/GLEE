``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a point where I'm still making a good profit, but also giving Bob some room to negotiate.  It's important to leave some room for negotiation, as it makes Bob more likely to accept, and also allows for potential counteroffers that might lead to a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low.  While I need to be flexible, I can't accept a price that's so far below my minimum.  I'll counter with a price closer to my desired value, but still lower than my minimum."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $900,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a good deal for you since it's worth $1,000,000 to you.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go above $950,000, Alice. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. Can you meet me at $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

I'm still not comfortable with Bob's offer. It's getting closer to my minimum, but it's still lower than what I want. I'll try to meet him halfway again with a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $950,000 is still below my minimum. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $975,000. It's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 975000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above $975,000. I'd be willing to meet you at $960,000. That's my final offer 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and although it's tempting to try to negotiate further, it's taking a lot of time and effort. It's clear that Bob is very firm on his price and I'm not sure how much more I can push him.  I'm confident that John is a reliable buyer, and selling to him will guarantee the price I need."
