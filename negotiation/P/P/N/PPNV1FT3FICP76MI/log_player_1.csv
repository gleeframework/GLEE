Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm valuing it at $1,900,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the return on investment you'll likely see."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 (John), I can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob.
* **Justification:**  By highlighting the product's ""exclusivity"" and ""potential return on investment,"" I'm aiming to create a sense of value that might justify the high price in Bob's mind. 
* **Negotiation room:** This high offer leaves room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, giving me a chance to reduce the price slightly while still staying well above my minimum. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy involves a degree of risk. There's a chance Bob might be completely turned off by the high price and refuse to negotiate. However, given the potential profit, it's a calculated risk worth taking."
