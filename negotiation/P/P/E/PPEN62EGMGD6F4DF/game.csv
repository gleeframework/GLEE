,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that 120 might be a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on 115? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product!",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're really close to the sweet spot, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at 112.50? It's a great compromise, and I think we can both be happy with this price.",112.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your efforts to find a solution. I'm willing to go up to $111 for the product. It's the most I can offer, but I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",111.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're being very reasonable, Bob! However, I'm still a bit short on the profit margin. I'm willing to meet you halfway between 112.50 and 111. How about we settle on 112? It's the highest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",112.0,Alice,7,
