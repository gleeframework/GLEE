Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer starts with a price above your minimum, leaving room for negotiation. It also leaves a potential profit margin for Bob, making the offer more appealing than selling to John for $100.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further to try and get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I'm still holding firm on getting a price that reflects the value of the product to me. This offer is a compromise, but it's also a fair price considering Bob's value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum, but I'm not willing to risk a prolonged negotiation that could lead to a lower price.  Since John is willing to pay my minimum, it's safer to sell to him and guarantee a reasonable profit."
