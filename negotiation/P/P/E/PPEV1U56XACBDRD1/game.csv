"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little bit more, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial offer. How about $90?  It's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,85.0
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $85 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $80, so how about $82.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",82.5,Bob,4,,
