# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget. However, I'm still confident that the product's value is higher than your offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $1350000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,290,000 is still above your target price of $1,200,000, but you're very close to closing the deal.  There's still room to negotiate, and it's worth another round to see if you can get closer to your desired price.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only one round left, Alice's counteroffer of $1,285,000 is still above your budget and target price of $1,200,000. While there's a chance she might accept your counteroffer, it's a high risk with low reward. At this point, it's more beneficial to buy the product from John, as you're guaranteed to get it at your maximum price, saving you time and potentially a further decrease in your budget."
