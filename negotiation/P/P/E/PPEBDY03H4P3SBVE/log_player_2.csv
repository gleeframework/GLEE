"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. It aligns perfectly with your current needs and has the potential to significantly enhance your operations. I'm confident it's worth at least $1,000,000 to you.  I'm offering it to you for $1,050,000. This represents a significant opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a price that reflects its true worth. Please consider this offer carefully, as it's only available for a limited time. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice presents the product well, her offer of $1,050,000 is higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  You know John will sell you the same product for $1,000,000.  It makes the most financial sense to buy from John and save the extra $50,000."
