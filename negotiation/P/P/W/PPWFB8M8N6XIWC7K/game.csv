"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,600,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $1,350,000? That's a significant move on my part, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product for both of us.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I can see you're serious about getting this deal done. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,550,000. This is a compromise that I think works for both of us, and I'm excited about the possibility of closing the deal.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
