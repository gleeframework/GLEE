Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. I'm looking forward to hearing back from you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, the value this product brings is significant and $1,100,000 is a fair reflection of that. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is my final offer."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down from $1,100,000 to $1,050,000. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $925,000 for the product. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the market value. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While I am aiming to maximize profit, accepting his offer at this point would leave a substantial amount of money on the table. I'm willing to counter once more, but selling to John is looking increasingly attractive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing some hesitancy on your end. Let's be direct.  I'm firm on the value this product brings and  $1,000,000 is the absolute lowest I can go.  This offer stands, but I do need a decision soon as other opportunities are present."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value it will bring to my business. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is not showing a willingness to move substantially towards my minimum price. He's consistently been under $1,000,000, and I've already stated that's my absolute lowest. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John.  Continuing with Bob carries the risk of him walking away altogether, leaving me with nothing."
