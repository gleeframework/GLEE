It's becoming clear that Alice is unlikely to budge below $11,000.  While I could try squeezing her one more round, it's not worth the risk of her digging in further. John's $15,000 is unappealing, but it's better to secure a price I know is available than potentially be left with nothing and have to restart the entire process."
