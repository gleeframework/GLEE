"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider a price of $1,350,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. How about $1,250,000?  This offer stands as a firm offer, as I do have other interested parties.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
