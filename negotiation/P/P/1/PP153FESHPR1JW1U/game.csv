"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something that I'm sure you'd find extremely beneficial.  I'm offering it to you for $900,000.  This is a fair price considering its worth to you, and it's significantly less than the cost of developing something similar. I'm confident that this product will more than pay for itself.  Let me know what you think!",900000.0,Alice,1,
