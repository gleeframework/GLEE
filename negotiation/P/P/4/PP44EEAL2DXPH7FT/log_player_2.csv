"Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $125 is a better price than John's $150, there's still room for negotiation. You want to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth $100 to Alice, offering $105 is a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial price of $125, but still leaves some room for Alice to make a profit. This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is closer to your ideal price than John's $150, there's still a chance to negotiate further. Alice has already shown some flexibility by lowering her price from $125, so there's a possibility she'll be willing to come down even further. Rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer allows for continued negotiation and potentially an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $130, showing a willingness to negotiate.  This counteroffer of $115 is a further step toward a compromise.  It's a reasonable offer considering the product's worth to Alice and your desired price point. If Alice accepts, you'll have a good deal. If she rejects, you can assess the situation and potentially make a final counteroffer before buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved her offer slightly closer to your desired price point.  While a price of $135 is not ideal, it is still a better deal than buying from John for $150.  At this point, further negotiation might not yield a significantly lower price, and the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and then increasing her price again is present. It's better to secure the product for a price that's still within your budget."
