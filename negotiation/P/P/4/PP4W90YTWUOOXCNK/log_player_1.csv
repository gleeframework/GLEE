Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal and would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This gives you room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value without explicitly stating why it's worth $20,000. This allows Bob to consider the offer without feeling pressured by specific features he might not value as highly.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is open-ended (""What do you think?""), suggesting a willingness to discuss the price further if Bob counters.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
