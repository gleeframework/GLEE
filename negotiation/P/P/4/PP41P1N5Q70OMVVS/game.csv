"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $900,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a revised price of $775,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",775000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $775,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $700,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm offering a revised price of $725,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",725000.0,Alice,5,
