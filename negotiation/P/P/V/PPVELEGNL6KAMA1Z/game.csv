"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $60. How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's a fair price for a product of this quality, and I'm willing to compromise to make a deal.",90.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about $75?  That's a pretty good price, and I'm ready to buy if you agree.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're getting close to your target price, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $75 and my original offer of $120. How about we try $100? It's a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with that price.",100.0,Alice,5,
