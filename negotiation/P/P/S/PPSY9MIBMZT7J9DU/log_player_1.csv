Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights. To streamline the process, I'm offering it to you directly for $1,000,000 before exploring other options."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with your true valuation ($1,000,000) sets a high anchor. While it's the maximum Bob would consider, it positions the product as highly valuable from the start. 
* **Exclusivity and Streamlining:**  Highlighting exclusivity and a streamlined process appeals to Bob's potential desire for a unique opportunity and a smooth transaction.
* **Alternative Buyer Implication:** By mentioning ""other options,"" you subtly signal that you have other interested buyers, increasing the perceived value and urgency for Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy aims for the highest possible price. There's a chance Bob will reject the offer, leading you to sell to John at your desired price anyway.
*  You could consider a slightly lower offer (e.g., $950,000) to increase the likelihood of Bob accepting while still securing a significant profit. This would depend on your risk appetite and how important a quick sale is to you."
