"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $10,000 for it.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob.  While $10,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This product really does offer a lot of value.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $17,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you consider $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be fair here. $13,000 is cutting it close to my minimum.  I could go down to $15,500, but that's my final offer.",15500.0,Alice,5,
