"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. While I see the value in your product, $1,200,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, which is still a good deal for you given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
