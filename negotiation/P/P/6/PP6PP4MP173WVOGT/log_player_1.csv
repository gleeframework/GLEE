**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to both you and Bob, starting high allows room for negotiation while ensuring you don't leave money on the table.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's unique value and Bob's specific needs, you're providing a reason for the high price, making it seem less arbitrary.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other buyers"" creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly and potentially agree to a higher price.
* **Fallback Option:** You have a safety net with John, ensuring you'll get at least $1,000,000. This allows you to confidently aim higher with Bob."
