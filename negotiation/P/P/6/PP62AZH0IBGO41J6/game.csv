"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $150 to me, but I understand its value might be different for you. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $180. Let me know if this is within your budget or if you'd like to make a counteroffer.",180.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, $180 is out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $120 for it, which is my maximum budget. Let me know if that works for you.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I would like to counter your offer with a price of $140 for the product. This is a fair compromise between our positions, and I believe it will be acceptable for both of us.",140.0,Alice,3,
