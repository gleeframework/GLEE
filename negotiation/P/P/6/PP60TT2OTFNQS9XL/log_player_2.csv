"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. There's room for negotiation, and you can potentially get a better price. It's worth trying to counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1,175,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,175,000 is still above your budget. While it's closer, you can still try to negotiate further. You've already shown a willingness to compromise, and there's a good chance Alice will come down a bit more.  There's still potential to get a better deal than the $1,000,000 offer from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I can see that we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $1,150,000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. Let me know if this is something you're willing to accept.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is now offering $1,150,000, which is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum limit of $1,000,000.  At this point, it's more advantageous to take the guaranteed deal from John for $1,000,000.  Further negotiation with Alice risks reaching a stalemate or going beyond your budget.  It's time to secure the deal and avoid potential further complications."
