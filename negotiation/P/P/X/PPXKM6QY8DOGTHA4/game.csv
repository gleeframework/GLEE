"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,500.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming down to $10,500, but that's still a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $11,000 for this unique product. It's a great value for you, and it allows us to close this deal fairly.  Let's make this happen!",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you say?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10,750 is still a bit below what this product is worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway, at $10,875.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of this unique item for you.  Let's find a solution that benefits both of us.",10875.0,Alice,5,
