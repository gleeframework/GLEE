"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I believe will be a great asset to you. I'm offering it to you for $11,500. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's close to my ideal outcome, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Building rapport:** I'm including a friendly message to start the conversation on a positive note. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** I'm confident the product is worth more to Bob, so I'm expecting a counteroffer and ready to negotiate. 
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $10,000 gives me a comfortable floor price in case negotiations don't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,500.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While $10,500 is better than John's offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Negotiation potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. His counteroffer suggests he's willing to pay more than my minimum.
* **Strategic rejection:** By rejecting his offer, I signal that I'm willing to continue the negotiation and am not desperate for a sale. This may encourage Bob to increase his offer further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down to $10,500, but that's still a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $11,000 for this unique product. It's a great value for you, and it allows us to close this deal fairly.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering strategically:** I'm countering Bob's offer, but staying firm on my desire for a price closer to my initial offer.
* **Splitting the difference:** This is a common negotiation tactic that signals a willingness to compromise while maintaining a reasonable price point.
* **Enthusiasm and urgency:** My message emphasizes the value of the product for Bob and creates a sense of urgency to close the deal. 
* **Moving closer to my goal:**  $11,000 is still a good price for me, but it's also closer to Bob's potential value for the product, potentially leading to a quick agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While $10,750 is slightly better than John's offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Negotiation potential:** There is still room for negotiation, as Bob has shown a willingness to increase his offer. 
* **Pushing for a better price:**  Rejecting his offer shows that I'm not willing to settle for anything below my minimum and signals my desire for a more favorable price.
* **Limited rounds:** With only 6 rounds left, I need to strategically reject offers that don't meet my minimum requirements, maximizing my chances of achieving a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10,750 is still a bit below what this product is worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway, at $10,875.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of this unique item for you.  Let's find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 10875}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's, showing a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Focusing on value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize why my price is justified.
* **Urgency:**  I'm  suggesting a solution that benefits both of us to encourage Bob to accept the offer and close the deal.
* **Strategic compromise:** This approach balances my desire for a higher price with the need to reach an agreement. It also keeps the negotiations moving forward and avoids a stalemate."
