Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm hoping to keep the price within my budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to $1,200,000? This would allow me to consider your offer seriously. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than John's offer, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price of $1,400,000.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial offer. How about $1,350,000? This would represent a significant saving for you while still allowing me to get a fair price for my product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. While $1,350,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still looking to stay within my budget. Could we possibly meet somewhere between $1,300,000 and $1,350,000? I believe this could be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000.

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $1,325,000 is a fair price that's close to my target price of $1,400,000, and it's much better than selling to John for $1,000,000.  It's time to close the deal."
