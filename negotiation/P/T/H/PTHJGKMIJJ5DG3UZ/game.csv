"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset that I know you'll find highly beneficial. This price reflects its worth, while still leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm hoping to keep the price within my budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to $1,200,000? This would allow me to consider your offer seriously.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial offer. How about $1,350,000? This would represent a significant saving for you while still allowing me to get a fair price for my product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. While $1,350,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still looking to stay within my budget. Could we possibly meet somewhere between $1,300,000 and $1,350,000? I believe this could be a fair compromise for both of us.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
