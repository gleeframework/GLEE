"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. This product offers unique advantages and I'm confident it will yield substantial returns for you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you believe the product has unique advantages, but I've done my research and I'm not convinced it's worth the premium you're asking for. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'm proposing $1,050,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
