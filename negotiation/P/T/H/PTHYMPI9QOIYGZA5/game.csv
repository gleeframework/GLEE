"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it has even greater potential for you.  I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a serious offer. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $900,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $1,050,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,025,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
