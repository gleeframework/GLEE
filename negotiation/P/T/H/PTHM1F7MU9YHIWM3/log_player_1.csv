Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $1,000,000 because you have a guaranteed sale to John.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. 
* **Potential Profit:**  There's a potential profit of $200,000 ($1,200,000 - $1,000,000) to be made if you sell to Bob.

**Offer Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal.  Here's a balanced approach:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I know you see its potential value, and I'm confident it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** Acknowledge Bob's interest and the product's value.
* **Strategic Price:** $1,150,000  is a strong starting point. It allows for negotiation but keeps you well above your minimum.  
* **No Justification:** Avoid giving lengthy explanations for your price. Let Bob respond and potentially counter-offer.

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. He might counter-offer, and you'll need to decide if his offer is acceptable or if you're better off selling to John."
