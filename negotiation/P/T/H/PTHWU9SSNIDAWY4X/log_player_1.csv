Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $130."", 
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $150, so he's willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $130 allows you to capture a significant portion of the potential profit while still ensuring Bob has an incentive to buy (he saves $20 compared to his valuation).

This strategy aims to strike a balance between a high offer that Bob is likely to accept and a price that secures a good profit for you."
