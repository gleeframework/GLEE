"Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you this unique product. Considering its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,300,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, considering its value to me and your potential profit margin. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer is more reflective of that. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. To show my commitment to a deal, I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my asking price.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,100,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value this product brings.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm appreciative of your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still more than I can justify.  Let's find a final compromise at $1,075,000. This would be a win-win scenario for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product and you to secure a fair price.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
