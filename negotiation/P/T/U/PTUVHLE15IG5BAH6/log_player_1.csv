Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,300,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, considering its value to me and your potential profit margin. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Round 4

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm appreciative of your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still more than I can justify.  Let's find a final compromise at $1,075,000. This would be a win-win scenario for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product and you to secure a fair price.
