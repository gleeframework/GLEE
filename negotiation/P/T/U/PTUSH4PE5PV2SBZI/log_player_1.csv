Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $90. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 90}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $75 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum of $80. I'll see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. How about $85? It's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal!"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to make a fair deal, but $85 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $77.50? That's my final offer 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $77.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $77.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $77.50 is getting closer to my minimum of $80, I'm still not comfortable with it. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $77.50 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $82.50. This is a fair price, and I think it's a good deal for both of us. Let's finalize this sale."", ""product_price"": 82.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $82.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $80, which is the price I was originally willing to pay. If you're not willing to go that low, I'll have to consider buying from someone else 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This is a great opportunity for me. Bob is offering my minimum price, and I'm running out of rounds. If I reject this offer, I risk losing the sale to Bob, and I'm only guaranteed to get $80 from John. So, I'll accept Bob's offer."
