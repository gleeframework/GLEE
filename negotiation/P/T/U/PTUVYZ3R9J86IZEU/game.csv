"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it has a lot of potential and I'm confident you'll be interested in it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price seems a bit high. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to let it go for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, I'm still finding it difficult to justify that price point.  Would you be willing to consider $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go below $825,000. This price still reflects the product's value to you and the market demand. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to be closer to my target. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I can see you're firm on the value, so I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000.  This is a significant investment for me, but I believe in the product's potential.",800000.0,Bob,6,
