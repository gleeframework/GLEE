"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible.  While $13,000 is a better price than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. $13,000 is a good starting point, but I'm really hoping to get it for closer to $12,000.  Would you be willing to come down a bit?"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to get a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $12500. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $12,500 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly less than John's price of $15,000 and still leaves some room for Alice to make a profit.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, forcing him to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price without risking a breakdown in negotiations."
