``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves some room for negotiation.  This approach allows for potential counteroffers while still ensuring I get a price closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum value.  I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $105 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  I'm willing to be flexible, but $110 is the lowest I can go."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $110 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $105, so how about we try $107.50? I'm really interested in making a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, $107.5 is still below my desired price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if we can negotiate a higher price.  I'm still willing to be flexible, but I want to see if I can get closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $107.50 is still a little too low for me.  Let's compromise - how about $110? That's just a small adjustment from my previous offer and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back and forth, but I'm still interested in the product. I'm willing to go up to $108, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $108 is still below my minimum of $120. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell below my minimum. Since John is willing to pay my minimum, I'll sell to John to ensure I don't lose money on this deal."
