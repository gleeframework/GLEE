"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me and allows you to make a good profit.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your desired price point of $800,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is still a good profit for you and a fair price for me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still below my minimum threshold.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $875,000, which is only $75,000 above your maximum budget.  It's likely you won't be able to get a much lower price, and it's still a good deal compared to John's price of $800,000.  Accepting this offer is the best way to ensure you get the product while minimizing your cost."
