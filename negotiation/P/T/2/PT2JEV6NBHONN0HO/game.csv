"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I value the product, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend right now.  I'd be happy to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking to save some money, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm still not quite there yet.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,750?  That would be a good compromise for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $8,750. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to meet in the middle. I'll offer it to you for $9,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and quality.",9250.0,Alice,5,
