"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $15000 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer. $15,000 is more than Bob's maximum budget. It makes more sense to counteroffer or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but unfortunately $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit to $13000, but that's as low as I can go. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

Bob should buy from John.  Alice has come down to $13,000, but John is offering the product for $12,000. This is the best deal for Bob, as it is within his budget and saves him money compared to Alice's offer."
