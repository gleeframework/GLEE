Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $15,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$15,000:** This is a starting point that is higher than my minimum value of $10,000. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially get a better price.
* **The Message:**  A friendly and open message encourages Bob to consider the offer.  

**Strategy:** 

This initial offer aims to gauge Bob's interest and establish a starting point for negotiation.  I'm prepared to counter-offer if necessary, but I'll also keep John's offer of $10,000 in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but unfortunately $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than John's offer, I'm not ready to sell just yet.  I believe the product is worth more than $12,000, and I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit to $13,000, but that's as low as I can go. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:**  I'm dropping the price by $2,000, but still maintaining a price higher than John's offer. 
* **Message:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and indicating a willingness to negotiate, but also setting a clear limit.

**Strategy:**

By meeting Bob halfway, I hope to encourage him to accept. However, I'm still prepared to reject his counteroffer if he doesn't agree to the price."
