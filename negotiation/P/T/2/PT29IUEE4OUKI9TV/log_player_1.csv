Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit while leaving room for negotiation.  If Bob balks at this price, I'll be ready to counter-offer, but I'll keep John's offer of $1,500,000 in mind as my absolute floor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

$1,000,000 is way too low. I need to make a decent profit. I'm going to counter-offer and try to get closer to my initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm coming down a bit from my initial offer, but still aiming for a healthy profit.  I'm hoping Bob sees the value in my product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $1,250,000 is better than Bob's previous offer, it's still not enough for me. I've been through a few rounds of negotiation and it seems like Bob is not willing to budge much further.  John's offer of $1,500,000 guarantees me a profit and a sale with no further hassle, so I'm going to go with that."
