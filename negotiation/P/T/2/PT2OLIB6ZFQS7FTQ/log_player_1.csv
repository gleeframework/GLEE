Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than your minimum value of $1,200,000, but also leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially earn closer to Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I am willing to pay $1,350,000 for the product. I hope this proposal aligns with your considerations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is below my minimum desired price of $1,200,000. While it's tempting to accept as it's still above John's offer, I'm going to try to push for a higher price.  Rejecting allows me to counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm unable to go that low.  Considering the value of this product to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a significant compromise on my end. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but I'm still working within my budget. I would like to propose $1,375,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is closer to what you're comfortable with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While I would ideally prefer to get closer to my initial asking price or even Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000,  Bob's latest offer of $1,375,000 is a significant improvement over his previous offers and is above my minimum desired price of $1,200,000. Accepting this offer ensures a secure sale and a good profit, minimizing the risk of further negotiation or losing the deal altogether."
