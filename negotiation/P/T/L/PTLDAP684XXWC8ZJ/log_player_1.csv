{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100.  It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is a compromise between your minimum price and Bob's estimated value. It also sets a friendly tone to encourage negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the deal, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would you be willing to consider $90 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $95? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I believe $90 was already a reasonable compromise. However, if you're unwilling to budge, I'd like to suggest an alternative. Would you consider selling the product to me for $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
While $92 is still below your ideal price, it's a good compromise. Further negotiation might lead to a slightly higher offer, but the risk of Bob walking away or you losing time and potentially missing out on selling to John outweighs the potential gain."
