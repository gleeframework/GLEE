Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the terms of the sale with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price given the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd like to propose a price of $1,000,000. This reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a fair profit for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I believe still reflects the product's value to you, while also being a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
