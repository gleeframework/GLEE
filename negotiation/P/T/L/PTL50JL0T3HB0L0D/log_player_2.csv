"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $150, but her offer of $120 is still significantly higher than your ideal price. 
* **Negotiation is possible.** Since you have 10 rounds, there's ample opportunity to negotiate a better price. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.**  This gives you leverage to push for a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant reduction:** My counteroffer of $100 is a substantial reduction from Alice's initial price of $120. 
* **Within my budget:** This price is still within my acceptable range. 
* **Testing the waters:** I'm gauging Alice's willingness to negotiate and seeing how low she's willing to go."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above my ideal price. 
* **More room for negotiation:** I'm willing to continue negotiating, as there's still a gap between Alice's offer and my target. 
* **John's offer is still a good fallback.** Having this option keeps the pressure on Alice to lower her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer represents a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer of $100 and Alice's current offer of $130. 
* **Testing flexibility:** I'm showing Alice I'm willing to be flexible while still aiming for a price closer to my ideal. 
* **Maintaining pressure:**  I'm not giving in easily, reminding Alice that John's offer is a viable alternative."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too close to John's price.** At $140, Alice's offer is only $10 less than John's price of $150. The potential savings are not worth the risk of further negotiation. 
* **Risk of escalating costs:** Alice's repeated rejections indicate she's not willing to come down significantly.  Continuing to negotiate could lead to further counteroffers, potentially pushing the price even higher. 
* **Time is limited:** With only 5 rounds remaining, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation, especially with John's offer as a reliable alternative."
