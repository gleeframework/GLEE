"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiations at a price of $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product is worth $1,200,000 to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for it. This is a fair price given my evaluation of the product's value.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $950,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your previous offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make a slight concession and offer you the product for $1,015,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you, and it's a compromise between our previous offers. What do you think?",1015000.0,Alice,5,
