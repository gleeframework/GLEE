"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth at least $100 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $115. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $110 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $112.50? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for.",112.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not sure I can go as high as $112.50. How about we meet in the middle at $111? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm willing to pay.",111.0,Bob,4,
