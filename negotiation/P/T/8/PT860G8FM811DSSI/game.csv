,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $170 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80.  What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $80 is significantly less than what I had in mind.  How about we meet halfway? Would you consider $125?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  While $125 is closer, it's still a bit above my budget. Could you do $95? I think that's a fair price.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but I need to be reasonable too.  $95 is just too low for me to consider.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $110?  That's my final offer.",110.0,Alice,5,
