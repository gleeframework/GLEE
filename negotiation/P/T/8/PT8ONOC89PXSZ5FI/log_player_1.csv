Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a bit high for me.  How about $90? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.

``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $90 is too low for me, and I'm confident I can get more."

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $95 is closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get a better deal.  I'm not ready to sell to John for $80 just yet."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  $95 is still a bit lower than I'm hoping for.  Let's meet in the middle at $100.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 100}
