Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am looking for a more reasonable price. Would you consider selling the product for $1500000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can get a better deal with further negotiation. I'm still confident in the product's value and want to maximize my earnings."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is still a bit too low for me. Given the unique value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Considering the product's value and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $1600000. This seems to be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer of $1,600,000. It's a fair price and closes the deal. While I could potentially get a slightly higher price with further negotiation, I value a quick and amicable conclusion. The risk of losing the deal to John or further negotiation delays outweighs the potential for a few hundred thousand dollars more."
