"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $9,500 is still a significant amount over Bob's perceived value of the product ($12,000).  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering a price significantly closer to his perceived value of $12,000. He's also acknowledging Alice's value of $8,000 by not going too low. This counteroffer shows good faith while still trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $9,700 is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. While it is lower than her initial offer, it's still not good enough for Bob. He is likely to be able to get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.  $9,000 is a good midpoint between Alice's last offer and Bob's perceived value. This counteroffer is still a good deal for Bob, as he can still save $2,000 compared to buying from John.  It also puts pressure on Alice to make a decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $9,800 is still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $12,000.  The negotiation is not moving in Bob's favor, and he's likely to only save a small amount of money by continuing to negotiate with Alice.

At this point, the potential savings are outweighed by the risk of not reaching a deal with Alice.  It's more beneficial for Bob to secure the product from John for $12,000, even if it's not the ideal price."
