Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy and the offer:

**Strategy:**

The key is to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal. Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to be slightly aggressive. Offering a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) creates a win-win situation.

**Offer:**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Knowing its value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and Bob's discerning nature.
* **Price:** $1,150,000 is a strong offer. It leaves you with a significant profit ($150,000 above your minimum) while still saving Bob $50,000 compared to his perceived value.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:** This assumes you don't know Bob's negotiation style. If he's known to be a hard bargainer, you might start slightly lower, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Relationship Building:** Even though you have John as a backup, maintaining a good relationship with Bob is beneficial for future deals."
