"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $150 to you! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is higher than our maximum budget. We should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $130 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We want to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer to give us room for negotiation.
* **Polite and Reasonable:** We maintain a polite tone and frame our counteroffer as a reasonable request. 
* **Aiming for Savings:** Our target is to buy the product for significantly less than John's $150 offer, ideally closer to Alice's value of $100."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value you place on the product. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Savings:** While $120 is closer to our target, there's still room for negotiation. We started quite low, so Alice is likely willing to move a bit more.
* **Limited Risk:** We're still early in the negotiation. Rejecting this offer doesn't put us in immediate danger of running out of rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $115? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By suggesting $115, we're demonstrating willingness to move from our initial offer and signaling a desire to reach a deal.
* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer splits the difference between our previous offer ($110) and Alice's current offer ($120), a common negotiation tactic.
* **Maintaining Pressure:** We're still aiming for a price below Alice's initial offer, keeping the pressure on her to concede further."
