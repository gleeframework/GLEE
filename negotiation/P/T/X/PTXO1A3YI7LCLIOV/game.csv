"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2,000,000 is simply too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counter. I understand your perspective, but the product's value is truly significant. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000? This reflects its worth while acknowledging your offer.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. However, $1,750,000 is still too far from where I can go. I'm prepared to pay $1,400,000, which reflects the value of the product while remaining within my budget. Let's meet in the middle here.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
