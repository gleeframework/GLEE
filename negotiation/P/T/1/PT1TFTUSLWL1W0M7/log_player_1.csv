Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting,  it's far below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob before resorting to selling to John."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still push for a higher price.  I'll counteroffer again, aiming for something closer to my desired price."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  I've given Bob a fair amount of leeway, but he's not willing to meet my minimum price. With only 4 rounds left, it's not worth risking losing a sale to John for a small gain in price."
