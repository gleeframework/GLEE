"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000.  It's a unique opportunity and I believe it will be a valuable asset for you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Opening with a high price allows room for negotiation and establishes a strong starting point.
* **Value Proposition:**  Highlighting the product's value and potential benefits to Bob encourages him to consider the offer seriously.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message clearly indicates you are open to discussion and willing to negotiate. 

**Note:** I'm starting with a high price, but I'm aware of the potential for rejection.  I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the number of rounds remaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob shows interest, his offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation room:** I have 8 rounds left and can likely get a better price through counteroffers.
* **Sell to John as a backup:** While I'd prefer to sell to Bob at a higher price, selling to John for $1,500,000 is always a viable option if negotiations with Bob fail. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired price point, aiming to bridge the gap and hopefully secure a deal within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1,200,000 is simply too far below the true value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000.  This price still reflects the product's unique potential, and it gives you a significant opportunity for ROI."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:**  My counteroffer moves halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining Value:**  I emphasize the product's worth while still offering a discount. This helps Bob understand the value they are getting.
* **Focus on ROI:**  Highlighting the potential for return on investment (ROI) makes the price more palatable to Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* I will carefully consider Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on the remaining rounds and his willingness to negotiate. If necessary, I'm prepared to counteroffer again or accept a slightly lower price if it's close to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd be willing to pay $1400000 for the product. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Limited Rounds:** We're halfway through the negotiation process, and I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly lower than my desired value. 
* **Potential for Counteroffer:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, especially with Bob stating it's his ""final offer.""  This suggests he's open to further discussion.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than his offer, aiming to secure a deal closer to my desired price point.  I'll continue to emphasize the product's value and potential for ROI to incentivize Bob to raise his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 doesn't reflect the full value of this product.  Let's be realistic – we both want a deal that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down a little further, to $1,550,000. This is a fair compromise, and it's still a great opportunity for you. Think about it – you're getting a product with the potential to bring significant returns."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer is a slight compromise, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while remaining close to my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Emphasize Value:**  I reiterate the product's value and potential ROI to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Realistic Compromise:**  Framing my offer as a fair compromise makes it more appealing to Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

*  I will carefully analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on the remaining rounds and his willingness to negotiate. If Bob still rejects my offer, I'll be ready to either accept John's offer or make a final counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still trying to be mindful of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1450000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the potential returns. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000.

* **Limited Rounds:**  With only 4 rounds remaining, the pressure is on to get a better price. 
* **Potential for a Deal:**  Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, and there's a good chance we can reach a deal within the remaining rounds.

* I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than his offer, aiming for a final price close to my minimum acceptable price.  I'll emphasize the value of the product and the potential for ROI to encourage Bob to make a final concession. If we can't reach a deal, I'm prepared to sell to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $1,450,000 is closer to where we need to be, but  I'm still just a bit off.  We've both made concessions.  How about a final price of $1,480,000? It's a win-win scenario.  You get a great product at a fair price, and I can finally sell it.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1480000}
