,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1200000 is simply too far below the true value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1750000.  This price still reflects the product's unique potential, and it gives you a significant opportunity for ROI.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd be willing to pay $1400000 for the product. This is my final offer.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1400000 doesn't reflect the full value of this product.  Let's be realistic – we both want a deal that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down a little further, to $1550000. This is a fair compromise, and it's still a great opportunity for you. Think about it – you're getting a product with the potential to bring significant returns.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still trying to be mindful of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1450000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the potential returns.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $1450000 is closer to where we need to be, but  I'm still just a bit off.  We've both made concessions.  How about a final price of $1480000? It's a win-win scenario.  You get a great product at a fair price, and I can finally sell it.  Let's make this happen.",1480000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $1450000. This is my final offer. If you're willing to meet me here, I'm ready to move forward.",1450000.0,Bob,8,
