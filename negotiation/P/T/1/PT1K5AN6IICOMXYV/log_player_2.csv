"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product at a price that I think is a great value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  You'd save $600,000 by accepting Alice's offer.
* **Even though Alice's offer is above your desired price point of $1,500,000, it's still the most financially beneficial option.**  It's better to save some money than to pay the full price to John."
