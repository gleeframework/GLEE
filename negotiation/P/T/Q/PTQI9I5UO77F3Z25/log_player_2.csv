"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit your endeavors. I'm initially offering it at $1,100,000. This is a starting point for our discussion, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,100,000 is still above his maximum budget of $800,000. He should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $850,000 is too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This reflects the true value of the product while recognizing your interest.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, $1,000,000 is still higher than his budget. He should continue to negotiate."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,000,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go to $900,000. This represents a significant compromise for me, and I'm hoping we can find a deal here."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and I'm trying to find a solution that works for both of us.  While $900,000 is still lower than I'd like, I'm willing to accept it IF you can assure me that you're able to close the deal quickly.  Time is valuable to me as well. Does this work for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While it's still higher than his ideal price, it's within his budget and Alice is making it contingent on a quick close. This suggests she might be motivated to sell quickly. If he rejects, he risks losing the deal, and he may not be able to get a better price from John."
