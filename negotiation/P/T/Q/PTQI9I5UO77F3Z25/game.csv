"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is above my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $850,000 at this time.  I'm hoping we can find a mutually agreeable price.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $850,000 is too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This reflects the true value of the product while recognizing your interest.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,000,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go to $900,000. This represents a significant compromise for me, and I'm hoping we can find a deal here.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and I'm trying to find a solution that works for both of us.  While $900,000 is still lower than I'd like, I'm willing to accept it IF you can assure me that you're able to close the deal quickly.  Time is valuable to me as well. Does this work for you?",900000.0,Alice,5,
