"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. There's plenty of room for negotiation before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $90?"", 
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** It's generally good to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than the asking price, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Polite and Interested:**  Maintaining a positive tone keeps the conversation open and encourages Alice to continue bargaining.
* **Targeting a Fair Deal:** This counteroffer aims for a price that's beneficial for both parties – a significant discount for Bob while still offering Alice a profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but we're still not in a range where accepting is ideal. We've got room to negotiate further before considering John's $120 backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. Let's make this easy – how about $95 and we have a deal?"", 
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise by meeting Alice halfway between her last offer ($100) and our previous counteroffer ($90). 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Phrasing like ""make this easy"" and ""we have a deal"" introduces a subtle sense of urgency, encouraging Alice to accept.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This price point puts us in a good position.  Even if Alice counters, it's likely to be very close to our target range."
