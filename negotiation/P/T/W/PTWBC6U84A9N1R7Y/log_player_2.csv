"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to sell you this great product! It's a fantastic opportunity to get a high-quality item at a reasonable price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
We're aiming to spend less than $100 if possible. Let's see if we can negotiate Alice down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price feels a little high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's opening.  This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a price that works well for us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $70. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still aiming for a better price. Let's continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $80? That's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

We're now proposing a price that's still within our budget and splits the difference between our previous offer and her current one. This keeps the negotiation moving while aiming for a good deal."
