"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget. Given my research and the product's potential, I'd be willing to pay $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering my investment and allows for both of us to benefit from the transaction.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product has incredible potential, and I'm confident in its value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000? This allows us both to walk away with a fair deal.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,700,000 is still outside of my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome.  Let's aim for a swift agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
