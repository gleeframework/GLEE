Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget. Given my research and the product's potential, I'd be willing to pay $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering my investment and allows for both of us to benefit from the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Explanation:  While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's clear he's unlikely to reach our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. We have a guaranteed offer from John at that price, so it's in our best interest to take the sure thing."
