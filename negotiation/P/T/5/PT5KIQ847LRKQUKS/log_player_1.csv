Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" aspect for both of us, making it more appealing for Bob to consider.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  $1,200,000 is a good starting point, allowing for potential counteroffers from Bob without reaching my absolute minimum. 
* **John as Backup:** I have a backup buyer in John, which allows me to confidently walk away from negotiations with Bob if they don't reach a satisfactory price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $1200000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation potential:** While Bob's offer is low, it shows a willingness to negotiate.  I can likely secure a higher price with a counteroffer. 
* **John's offer is secure:**  I have a guaranteed sale with John for a much better price, giving me leverage in negotiations with Bob. 

I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum, aiming to find a compromise that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still below what I need to consider. However, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Towards My Minimum:** My counteroffer of $1,100,000 is a significant step closer to my minimum price of $1,500,000, demonstrating my willingness to compromise.
* **Fairness and Compromise:** I emphasize ""fair deal"" and ""common ground"" to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to consider the value of the product.
* **Remaining Firm:** While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not giving away my product for a price far below its worth. The counteroffer still reflects the product's value and positions me for a potentially successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need for a good price, but $1100000 is still too high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $1000000. This price reflects the value to me and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob has moved closer to my minimum, $1,000,000 is still significantly lower than my desired price.
* **John's offer is guaranteed:** I have a guaranteed sale with John for $1,500,000, which is a much better deal for me. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Further negotiation with Bob might lead to a lower price or an extended negotiation process that could be costly in terms of time and effort.

Given these factors, it's more beneficial to accept John's offer and secure a significantly higher price for my product."
