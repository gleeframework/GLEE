"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I believe you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $18,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $15,000, which is my absolute maximum.  Let me know if that works for you.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. However, $15,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,500, which is a fair compromise. Let's close this deal.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to split the difference and pay $15,750.  This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",15750.0,Bob,4,
