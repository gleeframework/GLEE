# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a price of $10,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter his offer in the next round."
