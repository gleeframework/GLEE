{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

```

**Explanation:**

We are now in round 8, and there are only two rounds left. I have rejected multiple offers from Bob and lowered my counteroffers as much as I'm willing to.  It's clear Bob isn't willing to meet my price expectations.  To avoid potentially losing out on a deal altogether, I'm choosing to sell the product to John at his offer of $800,000."
