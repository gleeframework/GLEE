{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd love!  I'm asking $150 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer starts with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value ($120) but leaves room for negotiation. It also builds rapport by expressing confidence in the product's value to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable value, I can likely get more.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for your interest, Bob! While I appreciate your offer, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my original asking price. How about $135?  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $125 is a good compromise and only $5 less than my initial offer.  Given the risk of further negotiation, I'll accept and secure a sale."
