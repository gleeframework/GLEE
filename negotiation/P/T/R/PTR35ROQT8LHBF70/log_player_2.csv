You can do better than $1,300,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm starting with a low counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is well below Alice's asking price and closer to her own valuation. This will hopefully encourage her to negotiate further."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

Alice has moved a bit closer to my offer, but I believe we can still negotiate a better price. I'm going to reject her offer and make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $1,150,000. This is a  $50,000 increase from my previous offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise but still trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000

While I would love to keep negotiating, Alice has moved closer to my desired price.  At this point, buying from Alice for $1,275,000 is a better deal than buying from John for $1,500,000."
