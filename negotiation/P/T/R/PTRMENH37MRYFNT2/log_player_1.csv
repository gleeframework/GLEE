Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000.  I think it's a fair price that reflects the value it brings. Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will pay $15,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and a potentially quicker sale.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $14,000 is a strong offer that's significantly more attractive to Bob than his perceived value of $12,000. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** There's a chance Bob might counter-offer, giving you space to potentially meet in the middle while still exceeding your minimum price.

By starting with a strong but not overly aggressive offer, Alice increases the likelihood of a successful sale to Bob while keeping her profit margin high."
