"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to pay $875000 for the product. I think this is a reasonable price, considering the value it will bring to my business and the fact that I can buy it from John for $800000 if I don't come to an agreement with you.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm still not willing to go below $925000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to prioritize my own interests as well.",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but $925000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $885000 for the product. I think this is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John for $800000.",885000.0,Bob,6,
