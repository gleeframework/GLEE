Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  This would still be a good deal for both of us, as it's well above what you're willing to sell it for. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.
