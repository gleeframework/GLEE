"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your interests, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000.  This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is less than her product's worth to her, you have a better alternative. You know John will sell you the same product for $1,000,000. Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to proceed with buying from John and save $400,000."
