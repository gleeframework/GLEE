""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your interests, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000.  This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit, Minimize Risk:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, securing a deal with Bob quickly eliminates the need to wait for John and guarantees a sale. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 offers Bob a substantial discount (saving him $400,000) while still providing Alice with a significant profit above Bob's perceived value. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By mentioning other interested parties and presenting the offer as time-sensitive, Alice encourages Bob to make a decision quickly and potentially avoid missing out on what he might perceive as a good deal."
