"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,500,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider letting it go for $1,350,000.  This feels like a fair compromise. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
