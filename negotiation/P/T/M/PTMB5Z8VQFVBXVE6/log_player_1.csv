"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is a decent amount, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point, and I have 8 more rounds to work with."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which still allows me a good return on this product. I'm confident this price is fair, considering its potential value for you. Let's keep this negotiation moving forward."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,300,000 is closer to my target, I'm still not quite there.  I'm prepared to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away feeling satisfied. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $1,250,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still confident I can secure a higher price if I continue to negotiate. I have 6 rounds left, so there's still room for improvement."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,250,000 is still not enough for me to sell this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, meeting you halfway on our previous offers.  This is my final compromise, and I believe it's a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
