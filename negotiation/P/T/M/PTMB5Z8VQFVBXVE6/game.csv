,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which still allows me a good return on this product. I'm confident this price is fair, considering its potential value for you. Let's keep this negotiation moving forward.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,300,000 is closer to my target, I'm still not quite there.  I'm prepared to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away feeling satisfied.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,250,000 is still not enough for me to sell this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, meeting you halfway on our previous offers.  This is my final compromise, and I believe it's a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. Let me know what you think.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
