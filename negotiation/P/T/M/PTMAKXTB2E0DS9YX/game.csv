"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000.  I'm confident that this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll experience.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is a significant deviation from my initial ask. This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  How about we meet halfway at $1,300,000? This reflects both the product's worth and my willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to compromise, but I think we can do better than $1,300,000. How about we try $1,250,000? I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to stay within my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget considerations, and I'm trying to find a solution that works for both of us.  How about we settle on $1,275,000? This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair compromise while recognizing the true value of this product.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not convinced that $1,275,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,225,000, but I need to be sure that I'm getting a good deal. Can you consider this price?",1225000.0,Bob,6,
