"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to make a great deal. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a great starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $900000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save a bit more.  I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product.  This reflects its value to me, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850000. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
