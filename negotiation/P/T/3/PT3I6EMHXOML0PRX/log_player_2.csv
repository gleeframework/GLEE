"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll really love. I'm offering it to you for $95. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high.  We still have room to negotiate and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $95 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $70?"",
 ""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

We're starting with a counter-offer that's significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still leaves room for negotiation. This strategy aims to:

* **Gauge Alice's flexibility:** A low counter-offer can help us understand how willing Alice is to negotiate. 
* **Establish a favorable starting point:** Even if Alice rejects this offer, it sets the stage for future negotiations to potentially settle closer to our desired price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob,  $70 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While Alice has come down in price, $85 is still above our target price. We'll reject this offer and continue negotiating. We're getting closer to a potential deal, but we still have room to maneuver before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $78?"",
 ""product_price"": 78
}
``` 

Here's why this counter-offer makes sense:

* **Shows willingness to compromise:** By suggesting a middle ground, we demonstrate to Alice that we're serious about reaching a deal. 
* **Stays below our limit:** The offer of $78 keeps us comfortably below our $100 maximum and leaves some room for a final concession if needed. 
* **Applies pressure:**  We're moving closer to John's offer, subtly suggesting that Alice might lose the sale if she doesn't become more flexible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $78 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go down to $81. This is my final offer before I consider selling to John. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $81. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $81
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

Alice is signaling that this is her final offer, and the price of $81 is a good deal for us. It's below our $100 limit and close to Alice's perceived value.  There's a risk that Alice will sell to John if we push further."
