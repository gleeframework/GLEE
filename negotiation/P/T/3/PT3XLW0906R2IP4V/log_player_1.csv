"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This sets the stage for negotiation and gives me room to come down.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, subtly implying that it's worth more than what he's willing to pay. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While $1,200,000 is a high starting point, it's still less than the minimum I'm willing to accept ($1,000,000). This allows for a potential negotiation to a mutually acceptable price.

**Important Note:** This is just the first round. I will adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the remaining rounds. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to assess the situation and decide if I should continue negotiating with him or switch to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $650,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $650,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  While Bob's offer is low, he has shown interest in the product.  There's still room for negotiation. 
* **Protecting my interests:** Accepting his offer would mean a substantial loss. It's better to keep negotiating to see if we can find a more agreeable price.

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price that is closer to my desired value, but still leaves room for compromise. I will also emphasize the value proposition of the product for Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a different price in mind, but $650,000 is simply too low.  The product is truly worth more than that, and I'm sure you'll find it incredibly valuable.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $950,000. This gives you a great deal, and still allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that is significantly lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer, demonstrating willingness to negotiate.
* **Value Emphasis:** I continue to emphasize the product's value to Bob, reminding him of the potential benefits he'll reap from owning it. 
* **Middle Ground:**  $950,000 is a reasonable middle ground that could lead to a deal in the next round. 

**Strategy:** By making a counteroffer that's a bit more reasonable than my initial price, I'm trying to gauge Bob's willingness to meet me halfway. If he still rejects this offer, I'll need to evaluate whether to continue negotiations or move on to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but the gap is still a bit wide for me.  How about we try $750,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $750,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation is necessary:**  Although we're making progress, accepting Bob's offer would mean a substantial loss. I need to continue negotiating to try and close the gap.
* **Risk of John's offer:** While I'm focused on getting the best price from Bob, I need to keep in mind that I can always sell to John for $1,000,000.  This means I can afford to be a bit more patient with Bob.

**Next Steps:** I will make another counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my desired value. I'll try to find a compromise that will be attractive to Bob, but still allows me to make a decent profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to be flexible here.  $750,000 is still a little too low, but I want to make sure we can reach a deal.  Let's try $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:**  I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasis on Mutual Benefit:** I'm highlighting the ""mutually beneficial"" aspect of the deal, hoping to appeal to Bob's desire for a fair outcome.
* **Strategic Lowering:** $850,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price, but it's within range of a potential deal. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Watch Bob's Response:** If Bob rejects this offer again, I'll have to re-evaluate. My strategy will depend on how many rounds remain and whether I want to continue negotiating with Bob or go with John's offer.
* **Adjusting my strategy:** If Bob seems willing to negotiate, I might make a slight concession to close the deal. If he's not budging, I might consider a higher offer or even switch to John's deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer! I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'd be willing to go up to $775,000 to get this deal done.  It's a strong offer and I think it reflects a fair agreement for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $775,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  
* **John's offer is a safety net:** I have a guaranteed offer of $1,000,000 from John. This gives me the leverage to hold out for a better deal with Bob. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** Bob is clearly interested in the product and is willing to negotiate. I can continue to press for a higher price without significant risk.

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob that is closer to his offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'll emphasize the value proposition of the product and try to close the gap in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. Your offer is a good step forward, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  How about we meet in the middle at $812,500?  It's a good compromise that respects both of our positions. Let's finalize this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 812500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Strategic Midpoint:** $812,500 is the midpoint between Bob's offer of $775,000 and my previous offer of $850,000. This signals that I'm serious about finding a middle ground.
* **Emphasis on Finality:** I'm suggesting this is a good opportunity to finalize the deal, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept.

**Next Steps:**

* **Evaluate Bob's Response:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to consider my options. If I'm confident he'll eventually accept, I might consider making another concession. However, if he seems unwilling to budge, I'll likely switch to John's offer to secure a guaranteed sale.
* **Prepare for Potential Counteroffer:**  If Bob makes a counteroffer, I'll need to carefully assess whether it's worth accepting or if it's better to make a final counteroffer and risk losing the deal."
