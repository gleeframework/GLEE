Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a different price in mind, but $650,000 is simply too low.  The product is truly worth more than that, and I'm sure you'll find it incredibly valuable.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $950,000. This gives you a great deal, and still allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to be flexible here.  $750,000 is still a little too low, but I want to make sure we can reach a deal.  Let's try $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you say?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer. Your offer is a good step forward, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  How about we meet in the middle at $812,500?  It's a good compromise that respects both of our positions. Let's finalize this deal and move forward.

Alice is very slowly lowering her offer. It's unlikely she'll go below $800,000 within the remaining rounds.  It's time to cut your losses and buy from John for the guaranteed best price."
