{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a game-changer in its field, and I know it will be a valuable asset to your company. My initial offer is $1,200,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think your initial offer is a bit too high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth and the market value. What are your thoughts? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly below the product's worth to me.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a more favorable agreement."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, it's still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This takes into account your offer and gives you a very competitive price for this unique product. Let's see if we can reach a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $950,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, and I'm eager to finalize the deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still losing out on a significant portion of the product's value. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to explore it further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $950,000.  This product is truly exceptional, and I need to ensure I get a fair return on my investment.

What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $980,000 is getting close to my minimum, I'm still losing out on a considerable amount. I want to try to get a little closer to my desired price before considering selling to John. I'll try one more counteroffer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you and appreciate your willingness to go higher.  I'm willing to come down to $990,000.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my maximum budget, Alice, and I'm not sure I can go any higher. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000, but I'm not comfortable going up to $990,000. Can we meet at $985,000 and call it a day?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $985,000

While $985,000 is a tempting offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm running out of time.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John. I'm not willing to risk losing even more money by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
