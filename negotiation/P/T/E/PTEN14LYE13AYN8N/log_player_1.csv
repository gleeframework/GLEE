""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a unique chance to acquire an asset that could significantly benefit you."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's room to negotiate above your minimum price.
* **Your Minimum:** You're secure knowing John will buy it for $800,000, but aiming higher is key.
* **The Strategy:**  Starting at $1,300,000 leaves space for negotiation while still securing a significant profit above your minimum. This price point also aims to capture a larger portion of the value difference between what you're willing to sell for and what Bob is willing to pay."
