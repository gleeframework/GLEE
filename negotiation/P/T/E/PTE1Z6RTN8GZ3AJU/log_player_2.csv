"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,150,000 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal. He's aware of John's offer of $1,000,000, which sets a clear target for negotiations. By rejecting Alice's initial offer, Bob starts the counter-offer process, aiming to get closer to John's price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your understanding of the product's value.  To find a middle ground, I can offer it to you for $1,110,000. This reflects a significant price reduction on my end while still recognizing the true worth of what's being offered.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's counter-offer is lower than her original offer, it's still above what Bob wants to pay. He knows John is willing to sell for $1,000,000, so he's going to try and get closer to that price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  While your offer is tempting, I'm still seeking a slightly higher price to reflect the product's full value. I'm willing to make one final offer at $1,090,000. This is my best price, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,090,000 is only $90,000 more than what Bob can get from John.  It's a small difference, and Bob is likely comfortable accepting this offer to avoid further negotiation and the risk of losing the product altogether.  There's also a chance that Alice won't counteroffer again, and Bob might end up paying $1,000,000 from John."
