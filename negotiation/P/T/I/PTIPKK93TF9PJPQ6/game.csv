"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's well below its true value. Let me know what you think!",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects a significant discount from the true value of the product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can make this work!",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1,050,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,025,000. That's my final offer.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up, but $1,025,000 is still not quite there for me. Let's split the difference - I'm offering you the product for $1,037,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. Let's get this deal done!",1037500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000, but I need you to meet me halfway. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal. Let's try $1,012,500.",1012500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $1,012,500 is still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more to $1,020,000. This reflects a significant discount from the true value of the product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can make this work!",1020000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back and forth, but I'm still willing to work with you. I'm willing to meet you at $1,015,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you can meet me there, we can finalize the deal.",1015000.0,Bob,8,
