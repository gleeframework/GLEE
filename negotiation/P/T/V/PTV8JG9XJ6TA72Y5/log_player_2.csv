# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to you. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $800,000. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the middle of our original offer. How about we meet at $700,000? It's a fair compromise that still reflects the value of the product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I think $650,000 is the lowest I can go. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000.

This is a good point to accept the offer. Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:**  You're getting the product for $850,000 less than John's price.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Further negotiation might only yield small price drops.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:** Alice has signaled this is her final concession. Pushing further could make her walk away."
