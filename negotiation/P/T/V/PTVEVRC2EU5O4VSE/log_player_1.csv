{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us. I know it's worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to come down a bit from my minimum price of $1,200,000. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer balances a few things:

* **It's a good starting point:**  $1,100,000 is a reasonable compromise between your minimum and Bob's perceived value.
* **It shows flexibility:** By offering less than your minimum, you show Bob you're willing to negotiate.
* **It's a good price for you:** If Bob accepts, you'll still make a good profit. 
* **You can always go to John:**  If Bob rejects the offer, you can walk away and get your minimum from John."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counterpropose a price of $1,050,000 for the product. This is closer to what I am willing to pay, while still allowing me to save some money. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,050,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price. I'm confident in the value of my product and believe I can push for a higher price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000, which is a fair compromise between our positions. This would give you a good deal while still allowing me to get closer to my desired price. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
