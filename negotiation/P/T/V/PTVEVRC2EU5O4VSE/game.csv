"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us. I know it's worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to come down a bit from my minimum price of $1,200,000. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counterpropose a price of $1,050,000 for the product. This is closer to what I am willing to pay, while still allowing me to save some money. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000, which is a fair compromise between our positions. This would give you a good deal while still allowing me to get closer to my desired price. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. I would like to propose a price of $1,060,000 for the product. This is higher than my initial offer but still lower than your last proposal. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise for both of us. I hope you will consider this offer.",1060000.0,Bob,4,
