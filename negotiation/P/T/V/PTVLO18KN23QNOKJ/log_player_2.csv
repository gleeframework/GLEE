"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $9,500. Since the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer opens the door to a counteroffer and potentially a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $9,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500, which is still a fair price considering its value to you. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not comfortable going that low. How about $9,000? It's a fair price for both of us and lets us move forward with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,000 is still a good deal for Bob. It's lower than what John is offering, and it's closer to Bob's target price.  There's always the chance of negotiating further, but accepting the offer at this point minimizes risk and ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price."
