"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is too high for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $60 is significantly below the product's value. I could consider letting it go for $180.  What do you say?",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product has value, but I have a limited budget.  Could we meet somewhere in the middle, say around $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to get a fair price. How about $160? That's a significant price drop, and I'm confident it's a good deal for you.",160.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $160 is still more than I can spend. I could do $80, but that's my absolute limit.",80.0,Bob,6,
