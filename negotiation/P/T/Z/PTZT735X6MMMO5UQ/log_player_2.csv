You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can do better than $100, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy."

You have three options:

You're still above your desired price of $120.  You should reject the offer and make another counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm close to my minimum price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. How about $99.50?

You have three options:

While this offer is getting closer to your desired price, you're still above your budget.  It's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if you can get it down to $95."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to make this work.  How about $95? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum, but I still need to make a profit. How about $98? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $98
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, you've reached a stalemate. Alice is unwilling to go lower than $98, and you're unwilling to pay more than $95.  It's time to cut your losses and buy from John. Although it's not your ideal price, it's still within your budget, and it avoids further negotiation."
