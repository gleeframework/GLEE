"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a good starting point, as it leaves some room for negotiation while still being above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I'm confident that Bob will be willing to negotiate, but I want to start strong."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's tempting to take $9,000, it's below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $11,000. This is a reasonable compromise, showing that I am willing to negotiate, while still ensuring I make a profit. I believe this price is more attractive to Bob and will encourage him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and I am not willing to settle for a price that is significantly below my minimum. While I am open to negotiation, I believe I can still achieve a better price by continuing to negotiate. I will reject his offer and propose a new counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm further lowering my price to $10,500. This shows Bob that I'm serious about selling to him, but I'm still holding firm to a price that's at least somewhat above my minimum. I'm hoping this will be a sweet spot where he's willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're getting close to the end of the negotiation, and while Bob's offer is getting better, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm worried that if I keep rejecting his offers, we'll run out of time, and I'll be left with nothing.  John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, so it's safer to go with him."
