"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds immense value, and while I'm aiming for a price that reflects its worth, I'm open to starting the conversation at $1,300,000. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I believe the product's value is not quite at $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $900,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is a significant gap from where I see this product's value. To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I value our conversation and believe we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. Would you be willing to consider $1,150,000? This demonstrates my willingness to move closer to your offer while still acknowledging the product's true worth.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you have another buyer interested, but I'm still not convinced that the product's value is at $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll make a new offer of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value without breaking the bank.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but your offer doesn't reflect the significant value this product brings. I'm willing to make a final move to $1,050,000. However, I need to be upfront - if we can't agree on this price, I'll need to proceed with my other buyer. This is my best offer.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're willing to make a final move, but I'm still not convinced that the product's value is at $1,050,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $925,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",925000.0,Bob,6,
