{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $17,000. It's a great deal, and I believe you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price slightly higher than the product's worth to me, but not so high that it's immediately off-putting. I'm also leaving room for negotiation and keeping John's offer as a backup in case the negotiation with Bob falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to drop that much. I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer the product to you for $14,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $13000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget. Can we meet in the middle at $13500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,500 is close enough to my minimum acceptable price that I'm willing to accept it. While I'd prefer a higher price, it's better to close the deal now than to risk further negotiation and potentially losing the sale to John."
