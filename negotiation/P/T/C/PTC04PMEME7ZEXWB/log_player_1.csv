I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum value, I think I can still get a better price.  I'll counter with a slightly higher price in the next round."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:

I'm going to sell the product to John for $150. Bob has been unwilling to budge from $130, and while that's still above my minimum value, I'd rather not risk a lengthy negotiation that could lead to a lower price or a wasted opportunity. John is a sure thing at a price I'm happy with."
