Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a strategic offer to Bob:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. It's incredibly valuable, and I know you'll benefit greatly from it. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering its potential value to you."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Strong Alternative:**  Knowing John will buy it for $1,000,000 provides a safety net. This allows for a more assertive initial offer. 

**Important Note:**  Even if Bob counter-offers, be prepared to walk away if his offer goes below your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000."
