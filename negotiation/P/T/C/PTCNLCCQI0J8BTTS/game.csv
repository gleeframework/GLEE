"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $700,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $700,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle at $625,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",625000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $725,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $725,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.
