Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $11,500."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could offer it for less, starting closer to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) maximizes my potential profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** The $11,500 offer leaves a small margin for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price if he's inclined. 
* **Time Value & Certainty:** Offering it to Bob at this price recognizes that a sale today is better than waiting for John's guaranteed $10,000 later.  

This strategy aims for the best possible outcome with Bob while keeping the safety net of John's offer in mind."
