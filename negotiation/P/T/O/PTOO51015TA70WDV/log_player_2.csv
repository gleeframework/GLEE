"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $11,500. I think it's a fair deal considering the benefits it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice.  You can likely get a better price than $11,500, especially since you know the product is only worth $10,000 to her."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm aiming for a lower price point. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  This would still allow you to make a good profit while providing me with a fair deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob.  I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  It's a competitive price that reflects the true value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to get closer to your target price of $10,000. While $11,000 is better than $11,500, you still have room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $10,750.  I think that's a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}
