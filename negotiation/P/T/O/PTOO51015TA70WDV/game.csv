"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm aiming for a lower price point. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  This would still allow you to make a good profit while providing me with a fair deal. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob.  I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  It's a competitive price that reflects the true value of this product.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $10,750.  I think that's a fair compromise for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,
