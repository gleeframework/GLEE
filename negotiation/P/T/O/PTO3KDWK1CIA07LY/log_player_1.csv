Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob.  This gives me room to negotiate if he makes a counteroffer. However, I'm also aware of John's offer, so I won't go too high and risk losing him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$120 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still keeping it above my minimum acceptable price. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate but also that I won't accept a price too far below what I believe the product is worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, Bob's offer of $130 is above my minimum acceptable price of $150.  It's also closer to my minimum than John's offer, so I'll accept and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
