Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation. It's important to start above your minimum price of $10,000 to maximize potential profits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum price of $10,000. I'll reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm lowering the price to $12,000, which is still above my minimum but shows flexibility. This counteroffer attempts to find a middle ground that could be appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but it's still below it.  I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with a lower price. John offers a guaranteed $10,000, which is my minimum threshold.  It's time to take the secure deal and sell to John."
