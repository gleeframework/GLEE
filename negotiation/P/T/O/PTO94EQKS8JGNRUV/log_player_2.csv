I'm offering $8,000, which is a significant discount from Alice's initial price. This is a fair starting point for negotiation, considering my maximum budget is $10,000."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

While $12,000 is closer to my budget, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

I'm offering $9,500, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer. This is a good middle ground that should be more appealing to Alice while still staying within my budget."
