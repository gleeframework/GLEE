{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I'm sure you'll love it. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($80) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Friendly Approach:** I'm using a friendly and engaging tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm highlighting the potential value of the product for Bob. 

This strategy aims to:

* Gauge Bob's interest and potential budget.
* Create an opportunity for a back-and-forth negotiation, maximizing my potential profit.
* Provide a starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting his offer allows me to:

* **Maintain Leverage:**  By showing that I'm not desperate to sell at his price, I retain negotiating power.
* **Explore Higher Prices:**  I can make a counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Test Bob's Interest:**  By rejecting, I can gauge how serious Bob is about acquiring the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm willing to come down a bit, but $80 is just a little too low for me right now.  How about we split the difference and go with $90? That way, we both get a good deal. "", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while still proposing a price closer to my desired amount.
* **Mutual Benefit:**  I'm framing the counteroffer as a win-win scenario for both of us.
* **Specific Proposal:**  I've made a clear and concrete counteroffer, leaving less room for ambiguity. 

This strategy aims to:

* Show flexibility while maintaining my desired profit margin.
* Encourage Bob to accept, knowing he's getting a better price than his initial offer.
* Set the stage for a potential agreement that benefits both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $85, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $85 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80. While I would prefer a bit more, it's not worth risking losing the sale altogether.  By accepting his offer, I secure a sale that's only slightly below my desired price, and I avoid the possibility of further negotiation."
