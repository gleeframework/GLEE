"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! Given its value to you, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your perspective.  While $850,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,025,000? This would still provide you with a significant value, and allows me to recover a reasonable price. ",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,025,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something below $900,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $890,000?",890000.0,Bob,4,
