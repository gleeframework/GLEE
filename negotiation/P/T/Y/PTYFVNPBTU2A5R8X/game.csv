"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if you're interested in that.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $8,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair price that benefits us both.  Let me know if you're interested.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,500 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering your original asking price. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,4,
