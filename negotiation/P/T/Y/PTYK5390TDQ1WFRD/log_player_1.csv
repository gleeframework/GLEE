Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with my desired price of $10,000.  While I know Bob values the product at $8,000, I'm hoping to push for a deal closer to my minimum. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to counter, but I'm also ready to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I need. I'm going to counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."

I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I'm still holding firm on getting as close to $10,000 as possible.  $9,500 is a reasonable compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will see it that way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is still stubbornly low.  I'm not going to accept $8,750, it's too far below my minimum.  I'll counter again and see if we can reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to make one final counteroffer to Bob. $9,250 is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping he sees that. If he rejects again, I'm going to sell to John. I'm not going to waste any more time with him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750.

I've reached my limit with Bob. He's not willing to budge, and I'm not going to keep going back and forth. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for my minimum price."
