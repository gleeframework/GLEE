"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This is a starting point that is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also ensures that I am getting closer to my desired $15,000.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value Bob would receive from the product, making the offer more appealing. 

This strategy aims to start the negotiation process with a high offer, but one that is still within a reasonable range for Bob to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than Bob's initial perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my desired price point. It is too early in the negotiation to accept his offer.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating to see if I can get a better deal. I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, $9,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a great price for you, and it gives us a good starting point for a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$10,500:** This counteroffer represents a compromise. It's significantly higher than Bob's offer, but it also shows my willingness to negotiate. 
* **Message:**  The message is still friendly and emphasizes the value Bob would receive at this price point. It also suggests the possibility of further negotiation, keeping the conversation open. 

By offering a counter-offer, I'm hoping to inch closer to my desired price while also demonstrating my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  While $10,500 is closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm prepared to offer $9,500 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in it.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $9,500 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my target.  I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating.  I still have plenty of rounds left, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price point.  I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $15,000 if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,500 still falls short of what I need.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This offer reflects a fair compromise and would make this deal work for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000:**  This is another compromise offer, splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer. 
* **Message:** The message reiterates my understanding of Bob's position, emphasizing the compromise offered. It also highlights the mutual benefit of the deal.

By offering a counter-offer that reflects a more balanced compromise, I'm aiming to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to make a final decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $10,000.  I'm getting closer to my target price.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,750? This feels like a fair compromise that would allow us both to walk away satisfied. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,750 is getting closer to my target, it's still below what I'm willing to accept at this point in the negotiation. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating.  I still have several rounds left, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price point. I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $15,000 if negotiations fail.  It's important for me to stay firm on my desired price range and see if I can push Bob further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire to meet in the middle, but $9,750 is still too low for me. Let's try $10,250. This is a reasonable compromise, and it shows my commitment to closing this deal.  Let's get this done!"", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$10,250:** This offer is a slight increase from my previous offer, showing I'm willing to compromise but still have room to move up.
* **Message:**  The message emphasizes the compromise nature of the offer and uses encouraging language to push Bob towards a final agreement. 

At this point, I'm getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds and want to see if I can secure a price closer to my target without needing to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's aim for $9,875.  This is a small adjustment that would make the deal very close to being done. I hope we can reach an agreement on this final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We are running out of rounds, and Bob's offer of $9,875 is still below my desired price point.  At this point, it's more advantageous to sell to John for $15,000 and ensure a higher profit.  While I'd prefer to negotiate with Bob and potentially get closer to my target, the risk of not closing a deal and losing out on the opportunity to sell to John is too great."
