"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's better than her initial asking price, he can likely get it for less.  He has 10 rounds to negotiate and should aim for a price closer to his $8,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, $9,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a great price for you, and it gives us a good starting point for a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his desired price, he still has room to negotiate. There are still 7 rounds remaining, and he should aim for a price closer to $9,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  While $10,500 is closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm prepared to offer $9,500 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in it.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this point."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,500 still falls short of what I need.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This offer reflects a fair compromise and would make this deal work for both of us.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should continue to reject Alice's offer. He's getting closer to his desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. It's important to remember that Alice still values the product at $15,000, so there's a good chance she'll continue to lower her price. He has 5 rounds remaining, and he should aim for a price closer to $9,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $10,000.  I'm getting closer to my target price.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,750? This feels like a fair compromise that would allow us both to walk away satisfied. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to meet in the middle, but $9,750 is still too low for me. Let's try $10,250. This is a reasonable compromise, and it shows my commitment to closing this deal.  Let's get this done! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's tempting to take it, Bob is only 3 rounds away from buying the product from John for $8,000.  He should try to push Alice down further towards his target price, or risk having to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's aim for $9,875.  This is a small adjustment that would make the deal very close to being done. I hope we can reach an agreement on this final offer."", ""product_price"": 9875}
