(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget.  It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a lower price. You can always buy from John as a fallback option if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within a range that might be acceptable to Alice. It's a strong starting point to see how Alice values the product."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than your maximum budget. There's still an opportunity to negotiate further.  You can try to meet in the middle with a counteroffer that's closer to her current price but still lower than your maximum. If it fails, you have the option to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's higher than your previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to meet Alice halfway. It's also lower than her current price, leaving room for further negotiation if needed.  It's a good strategy to try and reach an agreement before resorting to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget, and you've already made several counteroffers.  At this point, it's likely that you're close to the bottom of Alice's acceptable price range.  To avoid potentially going back and forth for several more rounds, it's more efficient to buy the product from John for $1,000,000. You'll save time and still get the product within your budget."
