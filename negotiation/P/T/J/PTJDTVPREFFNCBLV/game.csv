"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $20000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, $20000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering my maximum value for this product.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is your maximum budget, but I'm afraid the product's value to me is higher than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to me. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm committed to $8000, which I believe is a fair price given my valuation and the potential for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're committed to $8000, but I'm starting to think we're not on the same page. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need you to meet me in the middle. I'll offer it to you for $12000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I'm hoping we can finally find an agreement.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $12000 is still above my budget. I'm firm on $8000, and I believe we can both benefit from a deal at that price.  If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to take my business elsewhere.",8000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're firm on $8000, but I'm starting to get concerned that we're not going to reach an agreement. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need you to understand that I'm not going to go any lower than $11000. This is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept, and I'm hoping you'll meet me there. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",11000.0,Alice,7,
