Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is your maximum budget, but I'm afraid the product's value to me is higher than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to me. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're committed to $8000, but I'm starting to think we're not on the same page. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need you to meet me in the middle. I'll offer it to you for $12000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I'm hoping we can finally find an agreement.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're firm on $8000, but I'm starting to get concerned that we're not going to reach an agreement. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need you to understand that I'm not going to go any lower than $11000. This is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept, and I'm hoping you'll meet me there. If not, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

``` 

Alice is getting closer, but I'm out of time and patience.  I've negotiated for six rounds, and I'm still $3,000 away from my goal.  I'm going to go with John to save time and avoid further frustration."
