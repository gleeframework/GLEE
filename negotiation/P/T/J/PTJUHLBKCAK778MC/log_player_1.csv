Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1200000 is still a bit too high for me. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $900000. This would still leave you with a significant profit, and it aligns with my budget. Let's see if we can reach a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
