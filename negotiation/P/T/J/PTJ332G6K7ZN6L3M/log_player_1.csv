{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product for $15,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're aiming to get more than your minimum of $12,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You have room to lower the price if Bob counteroffers, but you also have a good chance of getting a higher price if he's really interested.
* **It's clear and direct:** The message is concise and gets straight to the point.

Let me know if you want to adjust the offer, or if Bob makes a counteroffer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is your minimum, it's worth trying to get a slightly higher price.  There's still room for negotiation, and you can potentially get closer to your desired price of $15,000. 

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to send a counteroffer to Bob. Consider:

* **How much are you willing to lower your price?**  A small drop in price might be enough to seal the deal.
* **How determined is Bob?**  His counteroffer at your minimum might suggest he's serious about buying. 

Let me know what you want to counteroffer to Bob!"

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit to $13,000 to make this deal work. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Bob halfway:**  This offer is a good compromise, splitting the difference between your original offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows you're willing to negotiate but are still confident in the value of the product.
* **Maintaining room for negotiation:**  A potential counteroffer from Bob could still lead to a higher price, but it also gives you a good chance of securing a sale.
* **Clear and concise:**  The message is short and to the point, focusing on the price and the deal itself.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm interested in the product. Can you meet me at $11500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,500 is close to your minimum, it's still worth trying to get a bit more. You have a few factors working in your favor:

* **John's offer:** You have a guaranteed backup buyer at $12,000, giving you some leverage.
* **Bob's interest:** Bob is clearly interested in the product and willing to negotiate.
* **Potential for a higher price:** A small counteroffer might be enough to convince Bob to meet you halfway.

**Next Steps:**

* You should send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to your desired $12,000.

Let me know what you want to counteroffer to Bob!"

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget. I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which is a fair compromise.  It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to closing this deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This offer splits the difference between your previous offer ($13,000) and Bob's latest offer ($11,500), showing you're willing to compromise.
* **Keeping it close to your minimum:** This offer is only $500 below your minimum of $12,000, so you're not risking a big loss.
* **Highlighting the value:**  Reminding Bob it's a good deal for him adds a subtle push to accept the offer.

This counteroffer balances a reasonable compromise with your desire to get as close to your minimum as possible. Let's see if this is enough to convince Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still a bit short. Can you meet me at $11000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $11,000 is significantly below my minimum of $12,000.  While I could continue negotiating, I'm not comfortable going lower, especially with John's offer of $12,000 on the table.

It's important to remember my goal is to maximize profit. Selling to John guarantees I'll receive my minimum price, which is more profitable than risking further negotiations with Bob that may not result in a better outcome. 

**Final Decision:** Selling to John is the most sensible decision at this point."
