"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly valued by its previous owners. I believe it's worth more than what you're willing to pay, but let's start the discussion at $120. Looking forward to your response! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $120 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than the $100 he can get from John. Therefore, rejecting the offer and attempting to negotiate a lower price is the best strategy for this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $120 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** Bob wants to start low and give himself room to negotiate upward.  
* **Reasonable Offer:** $90 is still below what Bob is willing to pay for the product but allows for a potential compromise with Alice.
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a positive tone helps keep the negotiation open and avoids escalating tension."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Let me see if we can find common ground. I would like to offer the product to you for $105, which is still above your initial offer but closer to what I believe the value of the product is. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to John:** Alice's offer of $105 is only $5 away from what Bob can get from John. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still room to negotiate a lower price. Bob can potentially get a better deal by continuing the negotiation.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While buying from John is a safe option, Bob might be able to get the product for even less by continuing to bargain with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. However, $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference - I'll offer $100 for the product.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  This offer shows Bob is willing to compromise and meet Alice halfway. It's also a fair price considering Bob's willingness to pay $100 from John.
* **Final Offer?:**  Bob might be open to paying $100, so this is a strong offer to see if Alice will accept.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message remains friendly and emphasizes the benefits for both parties."
