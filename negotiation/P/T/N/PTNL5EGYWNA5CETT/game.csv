"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I see the value in the product, but that price point is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but  $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. I'm confident that this product can bring you significant value exceeding the $1,500,000 you estimate it at. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting closer to what works for me, Alice. How about we settle at $1,160,000?",1160000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,200,000. Would you consider $1,180,000? It's a strong offer reflecting the true value of this product.",1180000.0,Alice,5,
