"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the market demand.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm motivated to sell, $750,000 is below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? This recognizes its worth while still offering you a competitive price.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $925,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers at $812,500. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value while also being mindful of my budget.",812500.0,Bob,4,
