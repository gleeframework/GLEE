Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While we'd love to accommodate you, we need to maintain our pricing strategy. Therefore, I am proposing a counteroffer of $850,000 for the product. This still represents a significant discount while ensuring we receive a fair value for our item.

Alice is coming down, but we're still a good bit away from John's price.  Let's try to meet in the middle."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your continued engagement. I understand your financial constraints, and I'm glad to meet you halfway. However, we also need to ensure we receive a fair return for our investment. With that in mind, I propose a final counteroffer of $840,000 for the product. This price reflects a reasonable compromise between our needs and your budget.

This seems like a fair compromise.  We're saving $160,000 off the original price and avoiding going with John."
