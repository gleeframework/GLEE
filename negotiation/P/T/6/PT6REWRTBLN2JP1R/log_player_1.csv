Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my floor price of $1,000,000, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer. 

Let's see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is still within my acceptable range, but I believe I can do better. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,125,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still closer to my desired price than Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is a good compromise. It's within my desired range and significantly higher than what I could get from John. I'm happy to accept and close the deal."
