{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value of the product, giving him room to negotiate, but it's also lower than your minimum desired price, leaving you room to compromise if needed.  We'll see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum desired price. I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $13,500? This gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $13,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get closer to my $15,000 goal, Bob's offer of $13,000 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum desired price and it seems like he's not going to budge much further.  It's better to accept his offer now than risk losing the sale altogether or having to sell to John for less."
