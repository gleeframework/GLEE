"I understand that $200 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $175. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",175.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer it to you for $170. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great value for the product.",170.0,Alice,5,
