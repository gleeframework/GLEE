"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend right now.  Would you be willing to consider $9,500? I'm really interested in your product, and I think this price would be fair for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,500 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,250?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",10250.0,Alice,3,
