"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $150. I believe it's a great deal for its value."", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I think we can come to an agreement closer to my budget. Would you consider selling the product for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is our absolute minimum acceptable price. There's no room for negotiation upwards. Since we have a guaranteed offer from John at our minimum, it makes the most sense to sell to John and avoid further negotiation rounds."
