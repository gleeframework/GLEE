Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's as low as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm aiming for a higher price. Even though Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'll try to get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000? I believe this is a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 9000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we settle on $8,750? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750

I'm still aiming for a higher price than $8,750.  I'll counter with another offer and see if we can reach an agreement."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $9,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,875? This would be a fair price for both of us and allows us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 8875}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think $8,750 is the absolute maximum I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, Bob's offer is now very close to my minimum price. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and secures a decent profit.  There's a risk of going another round and getting a lower price, or worse, Bob walking away entirely. It's better to secure this deal and avoid those risks."
