,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's as low as I can go.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000? I believe this is a fair compromise.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we settle on $8,750? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $9,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,875? This would be a fair price for both of us and allows us to close the deal.",8875.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think $8,750 is the absolute maximum I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",8750.0,Bob,6,
