"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $14,000. Let me know if that's more to your liking.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're willing to accept it.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $12,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll offer it to you for $16,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can meet in the middle.",16000.0,Alice,5,
