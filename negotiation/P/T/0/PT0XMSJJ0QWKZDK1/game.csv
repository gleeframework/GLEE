"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $175. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it!",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your offer but $175 is a bit out of my budget.  How about $125? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $175 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $155? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $155 is still a bit high for me.  How about $140? I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go any higher than that.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $145? It's still a bit higher than your original offer, but I think it's a fair compromise.",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $145 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $142?  I'm really close to my limit here, and I think this is a fair final offer.",142.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're really close to your limit, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $147. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I get a good deal for my product. Let's meet in the middle at $144.5?",144.5,Alice,7,
