"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to own a one-of-a-kind item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a good deal compared to John's offer of $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better price, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $11,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value you place on the product. What do you think?
