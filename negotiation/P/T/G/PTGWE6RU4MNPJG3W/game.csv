"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm not willing to go above $12500. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $12500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13250? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $12500. How about we try to find a compromise at $13000? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",13000.0,Bob,4,
