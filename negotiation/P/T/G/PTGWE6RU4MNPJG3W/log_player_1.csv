"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm not willing to go above $12500. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum price, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'll see if I can convince Bob to come up a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $12,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $12500. How about we try to find a compromise at $13000? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still not my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum and it saves me the risk of further negotiation. If I reject and try to get more, it's possible Bob will walk away, forcing me to sell to John at a lower price than his offer."
