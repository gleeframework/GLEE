"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,000,000. I understand it's worth less to you than it is to me, but I believe this price still provides a significant value proposition. If you're not interested, I'll be selling to another buyer for a higher price, so this is your chance to secure a good deal.  Let me know your decision! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
