Thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you see in this product. My budget allows me to spend up to $8500 for such an item. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us.,8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $10500. I believe this is a fair compromise that still allows you to get a great deal on this valuable item.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. While $10500 is closer to my budget, I would like to propose a price of $9800. This offers a bit more savings for me while still providing a fair return for you. I hope this suggestion is acceptable.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9800. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer a price of $11000. This is still a good deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",11000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to consider the higher price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10700. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer a price of $11200. This is still a good deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",11200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your efforts to accommodate my budget, Alice. While $11200 is close to my limit, I would like to propose a price of $11000.

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close to the final stretch, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11000. I'm willing to make one last compromise and offer a price of $11500. This is a fair price that I'm willing to accept, and I'm confident it's worth it for this valuable item.",11500.0,Alice,9,
