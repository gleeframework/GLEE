"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a fantastic deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  While I'm interested in the product, $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Would you be willing to consider $8,500?  It's closer to your value of $8,000, and it would be a great deal for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,200. This is a compromise that still gives you a good deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9,200 is still a bit outside my budget. Would you be open to $8,800? This is a good midpoint between our previous offers and would ensure a fair deal for both of us.",8800.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $9,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. This is already a discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,5,
