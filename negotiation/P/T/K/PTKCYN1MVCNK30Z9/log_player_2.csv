"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a fantastic deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is $9,000, which is still above your maximum budget of $10,000. 
* You can potentially save money by counteroffering and negotiating with Alice. 
* Buying from John immediately would mean paying the full $10,000."

# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $9,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go.
