Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  While I'm interested in the product, $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Would you be willing to consider $8,500?  It's closer to your value of $8,000, and it would be a great deal for both of us.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
