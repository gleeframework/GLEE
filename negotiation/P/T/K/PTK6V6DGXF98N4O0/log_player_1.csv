{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** Bob values the product at $12,000, so he might be willing to pay a bit more.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** It allows for potential negotiation while still ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** It's easy for Bob to understand and respond to.

Remember, you can always adjust your price based on Bob's response. If he rejects, you can either lower the price or choose to sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your product,  $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is better than his initial valuation, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $13,500, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
