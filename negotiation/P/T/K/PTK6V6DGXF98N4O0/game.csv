"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your product,  $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $13,500, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen!",13500.0,Alice,3,
