"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $1,200,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value. I believe this price is fair and reflects the product's worth. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
