{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm willing to let it go for $120.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate if he counteroffers, but also signals that I'm confident in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. Can you meet me in the middle at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While $90 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $105. This still gives me a little room to negotiate but keeps it close to what I need. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
``` 
I'm offering $105, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  This shows I'm flexible but still want to earn a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $105 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $102.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $102.5 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'm willing to accept it as it's a good deal considering my other option is to sell to John for $100."
