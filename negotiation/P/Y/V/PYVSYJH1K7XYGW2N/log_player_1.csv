"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This is a starting point, as I don't know Bob's negotiation style. Offering $1,150,000 is a strong opening that shows you are confident in the value of the product while still leaving room for negotiation.  I'm aiming for a middle ground that gives Bob a good deal while maximizing my potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's not worth settling for the bare minimum. I'm confident that I can negotiate a better price with Bob in the following rounds. There is still room for compromise, and I'm not in a rush to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round, but still keeping it above Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I still believe the product is worth more. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more enticing for Bob and we can reach a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not willing to settle for $950,000.  I believe I can negotiate a better price.  There's still a chance that he might increase his offer, or I can make another counteroffer in the next round.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 would be an acceptable outcome, but I want to see if I can do better with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm meeting Bob halfway in this round, hoping to close the deal. This price is still above my minimum but shows I'm willing to compromise.  I believe this offer is fair and attractive to Bob, as it provides him a good deal without pushing me too far below my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to settle for $975,000.  With only four rounds left, I need to be strategic and not give up too much ground too quickly. I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob, or I have the option of selling to John if the negotiation doesn't go my way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000} 
```

I'm raising my price slightly from the last round, but not by much. This demonstrates that I'm still firm in my belief that the product is worth more than what Bob is offering.  I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be enough to push Bob closer to my target price, and we can close the deal in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $987,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to settle for $987,500. With only two rounds left, I'm feeling confident that I can push for a better price.  I've been consistent in my counteroffers, and Bob is clearly motivated to buy the product. I'm hoping to reach a compromise that benefits both of us in the final round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1012500} 
```

This is a final push to see if I can get closer to my target price while still being reasonable.  It's a small increase from the previous round, but it shows Bob that I'm still firm on the value of the product. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to decide between selling to John or accepting his final offer in the last round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $996,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $996,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's been a long negotiation with Bob, and while he's come close to my minimum, I'm not confident we can reach a deal in this final round. Selling to John ensures I get a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. It's better than risking further negotiation and potentially ending up with a lower price."
