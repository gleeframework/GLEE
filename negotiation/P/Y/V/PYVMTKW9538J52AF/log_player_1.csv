Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000.  This is a one-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, it's always best to aim higher initially. 
* **Understand Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so offering it for that price or slightly above would likely be accepted, but wouldn't maximize our profit.
* **Finding the Sweet Spot:** The offer of $1,400,000 is significantly above Bob's perceived value, but still represents a potential gain of $400,000 for him if he can leverage the product effectively. 
* **Creating Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" introduces a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly. 

This strategy attempts to strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
