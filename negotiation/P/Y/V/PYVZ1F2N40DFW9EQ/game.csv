"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to agree on a price. While I understand you're trying to get a good deal, your offers are way below what the product is worth.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to see a more reasonable offer. Let's try $1,100,000. This is my final compromise.  If this isn't acceptable to you, I'm going to have to move on to another buyer.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
