"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 
Alice's offer is close to your maximum but still leaves room for negotiation. You should try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70?"", 
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

This counteroffer attempts to anchor the price closer to your target. It's a starting point, and you can always negotiate further depending on Alice's response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $70. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $85? It's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is negotiating, which is good. While $85 is better, you're still below your maximum budget. There's room to push a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $75? That's a price I'm comfortable with."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

This counteroffer splits the difference between your previous offer ($70) and Alice's current offer ($80). It shows you're willing to negotiate but also holds firm on getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not willing to go as low as $75, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $82? It's a fair price that's close to what I was originally looking for, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly trying to stay above $80. At $82, you're getting a reasonable deal and further haggling might make you lose the product."
