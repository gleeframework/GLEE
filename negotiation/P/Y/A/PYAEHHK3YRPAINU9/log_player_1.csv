"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'm hoping to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to play ball.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy for the next round based on his counteroffer."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a significant sum, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can find a middle ground."

I'm going to counter with $900,000. This is a bit lower than my previous counteroffer, but still significantly higher than Bob's last offer.

It's time to cut my losses.  Bob clearly won't budge further, and I'm running out of time.  Selling to John for $800,000 is the best I can do to guarantee a sale at my minimum price."
