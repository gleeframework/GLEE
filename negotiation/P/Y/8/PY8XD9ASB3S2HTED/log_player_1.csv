"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a relatively high offer of $15,000.  This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.  If he's willing to pay close to this price, I'll know the product is valuable to him.  If not, I can adjust my strategy in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than my minimum of $10,000, I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $14,000. This demonstrates flexibility while still staying above Bob's initial offer.  Hopefully, this will encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  Although it's getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price.  I'm going to counteroffer in the next round and try to push for a price closer to $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $12,500. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer.  I'm trying to signal that I'm willing to meet him halfway, but I'm not going to give up on getting a price closer to my initial valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $12,500, I'm concerned that continuing to negotiate might risk losing Bob as a buyer altogether.  $11,500 is a good price, and it's better than selling to John for $10,000.  I'll take the deal and move on."
