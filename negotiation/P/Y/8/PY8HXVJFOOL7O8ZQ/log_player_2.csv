"Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is less than John's price, you can still potentially save more money by counter-offering.  Alice values the product at $80, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $85, which is a fair compromise between Alice's value of $80 and my maximum of $100. This gives Alice a profit and me a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $92 is only slightly better than her initial offer of $90.  I still have room to negotiate and potentially get a lower price. Since I'm only willing to pay $100 maximum, I'll continue to negotiate with Alice and hopefully reach a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 87}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $87, which is a slight increase from my previous counteroffer of $85. This shows Alice that I'm serious about negotiating but also that I'm not willing to go much higher.  Since John is selling for $100, I'm still getting a better deal with Alice, even at this price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $95 is now getting closer to my maximum of $100. While I could continue to negotiate, there's a good chance that she will continue to increase the price. At this point, it's more efficient to simply buy from John for $100 and avoid the risk of Alice pushing the price higher or potentially breaking off negotiations."
