"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has immense value and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still too high. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price.  There are still 9 rounds left to reach a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $900,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by making a significant move.  It's a good middle ground between Alice's offer and Bob's maximum price. Hopefully, Alice will be willing to budge a little to get closer to Bob's target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $750,000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $850,000. This is a compromise between our initial offers and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $850,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price. While it's a slight concession, there's still room for further negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue haggling for a better price before time runs out or he needs to resort to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $850,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $800,000.  This is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a strong move. It meets Alice's last offer halfway, making it a good compromise and showing Bob's willingness to negotiate.  It also aligns with Bob's target price of $800,000.  Hopefully, Alice will accept this offer, but if not, there's still time for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $800,000 is a fair price for you, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $825,000. This is a compromise between our previous offers and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $825,000 is a reasonable compromise and is within Bob's budget.  With only 5 rounds remaining, it's a good idea to accept the offer and secure the product.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will continue to hold out and time could run out, forcing him to buy from John at a much higher price."
