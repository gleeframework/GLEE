Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to $15,000 as possible, but you also want to make sure Bob is likely to accept.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  You know Bob values the product at $12,000. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $14,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.  
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a safety net with John, ensuring you won't be forced to go below your minimum.

By starting high but still offering a price that's potentially attractive to Bob, you maximize your chances of a successful sale at a price that benefits you."
