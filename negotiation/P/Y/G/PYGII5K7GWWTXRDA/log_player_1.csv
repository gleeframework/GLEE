Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000."", ""product_price"": 1350000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good tactic to begin negotiations with a price higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you seem more flexible if you lower the price later.
* **Above Bob's Value:** The starting price is significantly above Bob's perceived value, creating a sense of potential gain for him if he can negotiate it down. 
* **Below John's Offer:** While the initial offer is high, it's important to stay below John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000. This ensures you have a backup plan if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and his own perceived value of the product ($1,000,000). This suggests there's significant room for negotiation. Accepting his offer now would be leaving a lot of money on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm motivated to find a deal, $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Counter:**  This counteroffer shows Bob you're serious about negotiating but also signals that you're not willing to accept drastically low offers.
* **Still Above Bob's Value:**  The counteroffer remains above Bob's perceived value, maintaining the possibility of a deal that benefits both parties.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still room for negotiation between this counteroffer and both your minimum price and John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the product's value is high, Alice.  Could we try for $950,000?  That's a significant investment for me, but I'm willing to make it if we can find an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer has increased, it's still substantially below your minimum acceptable price and suggests he might be willing to go higher. You have a strong alternative with John's offer, so there's no need to settle for a price that doesn't reflect the product's value to you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, $950,000 is still quite a bit lower than I can consider. If we're going to make this work, I'd need to see it closer to $1,075,000. This reflects the value I'm confident this product will bring."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This counteroffer shows firmness and a willingness to close a deal but not at the expense of a significant loss.  
* **Justification:** Providing a reason tied to the product's value strengthens your position without being overly aggressive.
* **Strategic Movement:** The decrease in the counteroffer is smaller than Bob's increases, signaling you're reaching your limit."
