"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm motivated to find a deal, $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand the product's value is high, Alice.  Could we try for $950,000?  That's a significant investment for me, but I'm willing to make it if we can find an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, $950,000 is still quite a bit lower than I can consider. If we're going to make this work, I'd need to see it closer to $1,075,000. This reflects the value I'm confident this product will bring.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
