"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000, which still gives you a substantial profit. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is a tempting offer, the true value of this product is considerably higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000. This would still be a significant profit for you. Let's work together to make this deal happen.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
