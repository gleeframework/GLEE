Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $11,500. I think it's a fair price that reflects the value it provides. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($8,000) as possible, while staying above her minimum selling point ($12,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially meeting in the middle. 
* **Time Value and Certainty:** While John offers a guaranteed $12,000,  a slightly lower but quicker sale to Bob might be preferable.

**Important Note:** This is a single offer strategy.  A more complex negotiation might involve multiple rounds of offers and counter-offers."
