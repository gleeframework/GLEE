Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and increasing the chance Bob accepts. Here's why:

* **Higher than Bob's value:**  $115 is higher than Bob's valuation of $100, meaning he'll need to decide if the extra value is worth it to him.
* **Lower than John's value:** $115 is less than John's valuation of $120, meaning I still get a good price if Bob rejects the offer. 

This approach increases the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer while ensuring I don't miss out on a better deal with John."
