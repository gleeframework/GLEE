"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product that I believe will be a great asset to your business. My asking price is $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  While it's within your budget, it's still far from the product's worth to her, suggesting a large potential for negotiation.  It's worth trying to get a better price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows us both to walk away happy.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's still above the product's value to her, leaving room for potential negotiation. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still pursuing a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the significant value this product brings to your business, I believe a price of $1,050,000 is a fair compromise. Let's meet halfway and finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still a bit high. I believe there's room for further negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows me to push for a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still above my ideal price point.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is a fair price for both of us. This offer demonstrates a serious commitment to making this deal happen.  Let's see if we can close this quickly."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a small increase from my previous offer, showing a willingness to compromise.  It's still a good price for me and leaves a reasonable profit for Alice, increasing the likelihood of her acceptance.  The message emphasizes my commitment to a quick and positive outcome."
