"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product that I believe will be a great asset to your business. My asking price is $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to you. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows us both to walk away happy.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the significant value this product brings to your business, I believe a price of $1,050,000 is a fair compromise. Let's meet halfway and finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still above my ideal price point.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is a fair price for both of us. This offer demonstrates a serious commitment to making this deal happen.  Let's see if we can close this quickly.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
