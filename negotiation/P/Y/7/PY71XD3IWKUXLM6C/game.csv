"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. It's worth a significant amount to you, and I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. My starting price is $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  How about we bring it down to $900,000?  I think that's a fair price that reflects the value it holds for me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is a bit low for me, considering the value of this product.  Let's split the difference and aim for $1,050,000.  This price reflects the significant value it holds for you while still allowing me a fair profit.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,050,000 is closer, but still a bit too steep for me. How about we settle on $975,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to continue negotiating.  However, $975,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,012,500.  This offer is fair to both of us and ensures we both walk away with a good deal.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement that satisfies both our needs.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close!  I can tell we're both motivated to make this work.  How about we split the difference again and land at $993,750?  That seems like a fair deal for both of us.",993750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. $993,750 is closer to my target price, but I'm still looking for a little more. Let's settle on $1,003,125. It's a fair compromise and reflects the true value of this product for you. I'm confident we can finalize this deal and both be happy with the outcome.",1003125.0,Alice,7,
