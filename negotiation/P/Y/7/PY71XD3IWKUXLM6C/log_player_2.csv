How about we bring it down to $900,000?  I think that's a fair price that reflects the value it holds for me."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is a bit low for me, considering the value of this product.  Let's split the difference and aim for $1,050,000.  This price reflects the significant value it holds for you while still allowing me a fair profit.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to continue negotiating.  However, $975,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,012,500.  This offer is fair to both of us and ensures we both walk away with a good deal.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement that satisfies both our needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,012,500. 
You have three options:

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close!  I can tell we're both motivated to make this work.  How about we split the difference again and land at $993,750?  That seems like a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 993750}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. $993,750 is closer to my target price, but I'm still looking for a little more. Let's settle on $1,003,125. It's a fair compromise and reflects the true value of this product for you. I'm confident we can finalize this deal and both be happy with the outcome. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,003,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,003,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

We've successfully negotiated Alice down significantly. While we could potentially squeeze out a few more thousand dollars, it's getting riskier. Accepting at $1,003,125 guarantees a good deal below our $1,500,000 maximum and avoids the risk of Alice increasing her price or the negotiation falling through."
