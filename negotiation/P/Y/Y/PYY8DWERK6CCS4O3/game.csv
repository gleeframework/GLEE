"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what I'd sell it to someone else for, and still leaves you with a good margin. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. Can you consider this offer?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is too far below what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This gives us both a fair profit. Let me know what you think.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that we're still far apart, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer $975,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
