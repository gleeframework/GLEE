"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $250.",250.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $250 is a bit out of my range. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to pay $100 at this time. Would you be open to that?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $250 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $175. It's a great compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $175 is still a little high for me. How about $150? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also being within my budget.",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a tempting offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $160. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",160.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $160 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $140. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",140.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $140 is a bit lower than my original price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $155. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",155.0,Alice,7,
