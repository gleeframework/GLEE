Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $20000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's value. Considering your budget, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $16000. It's a compromise that I think is fair for both of us. What do you think?
