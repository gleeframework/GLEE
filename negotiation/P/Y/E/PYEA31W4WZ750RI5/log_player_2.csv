"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:**  Alice is offering the product for $950,000, which is still less than your maximum value of $1,000,000. 
* **John's Offer:**  John will sell the product for $1,000,000, which is your maximum limit.
* **Comparison:** Accepting Alice's offer saves you $50,000 compared to buying from John.

**Therefore, it makes sense to accept Alice's offer.**"
