Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum acceptable price:**  You're aiming for a profit, and $140 is better than $120.
* **It's lower than the product's worth to Bob:** This gives Bob room to negotiate while still leaving you with a good profit.

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $110 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $125?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```"
