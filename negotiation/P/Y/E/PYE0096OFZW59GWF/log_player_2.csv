"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to buying from John.  There's room to save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $110?"",
 ""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's offer and my maximum budget. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Polite but Direct:** The message is polite to maintain a positive interaction but clearly states my price expectation. 
* **Strategic Aim:** My goal is to get the price as close to Alice's value ($120) as possible without exceeding my own budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $110 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $125?  It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Compromise:** Alice has met me in the middle.  $125 is a fair price, saving me $15 from her original offer and $25 from John's price. 
* **Limited Time:**  While I could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Alice will go lower. Accepting now secures a good deal."
