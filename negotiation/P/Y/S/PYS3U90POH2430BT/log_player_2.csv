Round 3

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer! I'm willing to meet you at $765,000, which is just a slight adjustment from your last offer. I think this price still reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal. What do you think?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but in small increments.  At $765,000, the price is getting close enough to her value that she may not budge much further.  It's better to accept a good deal now than risk the negotiation going sour and having to buy from John at a much higher price."
