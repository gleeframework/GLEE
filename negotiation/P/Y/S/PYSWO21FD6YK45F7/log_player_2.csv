"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $150. Is this something you'd like to consider?

Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a lower price, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110. Is that something you'd be interested in?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go up to $115, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's clear that Alice is unlikely to go below $100.  You're better off taking John's offer and saving the most money."
