"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I do see the value in this product, $1,000,000 is unfortunately out of my range.  I'm prepared to offer $850,000 for it, given its potential benefit to my business.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the potential benefits it can bring to your business.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $950,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant step for me. Let's see if we can find a middle ground and close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the potential benefits it can bring to your business.",925000.0,Alice,5,
