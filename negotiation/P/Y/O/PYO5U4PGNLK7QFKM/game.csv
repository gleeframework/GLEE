"Alice, your product is definitely valuable, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000, which is still a fair price given my budget and the product's worth. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I understand your budget constraints, $1,300,000 is unfortunately still a bit too low for me.  To show you my willingness to negotiate, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows you to get a great deal. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
