"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,400,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value to Bob and framing it as a ""great deal"". This encourages him to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm explicitly asking for Bob's opinion, suggesting flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is definitely valuable, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000, which is still a fair price given my budget and the product's worth. Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob.  
* **Selling to John:** While selling to John guarantees $1,500,000, it's worth exploring if I can get closer to that with Bob. I have 8 rounds left to see if we can reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I understand your budget constraints, $1,300,000 is unfortunately still a bit too low for me.  To show you my willingness to negotiate, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows you to get a great deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm making a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. This shows flexibility without giving away too much.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" Bob can get, appealing to his desire for value.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm asking for Bob's opinion, keeping the door open for further negotiations."
