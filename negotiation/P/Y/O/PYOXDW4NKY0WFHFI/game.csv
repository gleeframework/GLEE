"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I have to inform you that the product is worth much more than what you're offering. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $22000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm willing to sell it for. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still feel that the product's value doesn't justify the price. I would like to counteroffer at $16000. This price reflects my assessment of the product's value and what I consider to be a reasonable price for it.",16000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm still not willing to go below $20000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer it to you for $18500. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",18500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I see that we're still quite far apart in terms of pricing, Alice. While I understand your position, I still believe that $16000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to stick to this number, as it aligns closely with my assessment of its value. I hope we can come to an agreement, but if not, I will consider purchasing the product from another seller.",16000.0,Bob,6,
