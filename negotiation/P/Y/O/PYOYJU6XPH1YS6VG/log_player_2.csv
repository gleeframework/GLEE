Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $850,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to negotiate to find a solution. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This acknowledges the product's true value while offering you a significant discount.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,000,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with, I'm willing to go up to $900,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $900,000 is close, but I need to be closer to my bottom line.  Would you consider $950,000? This is my final offer.

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer of $950,000 is still above my ideal price, but it's getting close.  Considering the potential value of the product and the fact that I can always buy it from John for $800,000,  accepting Alice's offer is the best course of action. This allows me to secure the product at a price that's within my budget and potentially more beneficial than John's offer."
