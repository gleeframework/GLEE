"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately above my budget.  I'm very interested in this product and would be willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price given my valuation and would allow for a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $850,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to negotiate to find a solution. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This acknowledges the product's true value while offering you a significant discount.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,000,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with, I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product while giving you a price that's more than what John is offering.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $900,000 is close, but I need to be closer to my bottom line.  Would you consider $950,000? This is my final offer.",950000.0,Alice,5,
