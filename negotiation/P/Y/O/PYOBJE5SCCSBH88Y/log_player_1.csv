Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I know it's valuable to you, and I'm willing to make a deal at $1,400,000. This offer is only valid for a limited time, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to $1,500,000 as possible (John's offer).
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Creating Urgency:** By mentioning a limited time offer and other interested parties, we encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept a higher price.

Offering the product at $1,400,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit above Bob's perceived value."
