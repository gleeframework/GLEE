"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire my product.  Given its potential value, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering its worth to you."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We begin with a strong opening offer close to Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming to secure a high profit margin.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the price, even if general, can make the offer seem more reasonable. 
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive and collaborative tone encourages continued negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I think it's a bit high. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $850,000 is tempting, we're still in the early stages of negotiation.  Rejecting his offer signals that we believe the product is worth more and keeps the door open for a higher counteroffer. We're willing to risk a few more rounds to see if we can reach a price closer to $900,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I believe the value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down slightly to $925,000. This offer represents a good balance between our respective valuations."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession, but Firm:**  We're making a concession by lowering the price, but not drastically. This shows flexibility while still demonstrating we believe in the product's high value. 
* **Justification:** We reiterate that our price is anchored in the product's inherent worth.
* **Aiming High:** Our goal is to still close the deal above $900,000, so we're targeting a price point that allows for some further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're now at a crucial point. Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, but we need to gauge his seriousness. While $875,000 is a good price, we're willing to risk another round to see if he'll move closer to $900,000. Rejecting now sends a clear signal that we're not settling for less.  We'll aim for a counteroffer that encourages him to make a significant jump or accept that we're not budging much further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we seem to be getting close, but I need you to understand the true value of what I'm offering. I'm willing to make one final concession to seal the deal: $900,000.  This is my best and final offer. It represents a significant discount on its potential for you."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This counteroffer strikes a balance between firmness and a final concession. By stating it's our ""best and final offer,"" we signal seriousness and limit further back-and-forth.
* **Highlighting Value:** We're reminding Bob of the product's potential value to him, emphasizing that even at $900,000, he's getting a good deal. 
* **Creating Urgency:**  By framing this as our final offer, we create a sense of urgency for Bob to make a decision. 
* **Safety Net:** If Bob rejects this offer, we'll still have five rounds to reconsider our position or walk away with John's offer of $800,000 as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not convinced it's the best deal for me. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product, and that's my final offer. I'm not willing to go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has countered with his own ""final offer"" of $875,000.  While we aimed for $900,000,  it's unlikely he'll move significantly higher. Here's why accepting is the best strategy:

* **Strong Profit:**  $875,000 is a significant profit over our minimum of $800,000. It's better to secure a very good deal now than risk losing Bob entirely.
* **Negotiating Stalemate:** We're reaching a point of diminishing returns in the negotiation.  Continuing might just lead to frustration or even cause Bob to walk away.
* **Alternative Considered:** While John offers $800,000, Bob's offer is a $75,000 improvement.  It's unlikely we'll get a better offer from other potential buyers at this stage. 

In short, accepting Bob's offer at $875,000 maximizes our profit while minimizing the risk of losing the sale."
