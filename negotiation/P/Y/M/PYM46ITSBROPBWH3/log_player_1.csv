Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, but I think that's the highest I can go. Can you meet me at $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob seems anchored at $1,200,000. It's time to show some flexibility, but also a willingness to walk away, to push him a bit further."

Round 5

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, but I need to be convinced that it's the best deal I can get. Can you throw in some extras or consider a discount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is firmly anchored at $1,200,000 and asking for extras. He's unlikely to move significantly higher. Accepting the $1,200,000 avoids the risk of him walking away and having to accept John's $1,000,000 offer. It's a significant profit, even if not the ideal price."
