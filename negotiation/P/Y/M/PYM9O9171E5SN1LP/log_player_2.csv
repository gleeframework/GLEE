"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $150 to you, and Alice is offering it for $90. This is a good deal, but you can likely get it for even less. You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
``` 

You're aiming to save as much as possible, so start with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still reasonable. $75 is a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still being within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is still a good deal, you've already shown Alice you're willing to negotiate.  Rejecting her offer and making another counteroffer keeps the pressure on her to meet your price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

You've established a range with your previous counteroffers, so now you're moving closer to Alice's price while still trying to get a better deal. $80 is a reasonable compromise."
