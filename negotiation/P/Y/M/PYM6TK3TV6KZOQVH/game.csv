I'm willing to offer $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product and my budget.  Let's work together to finalize this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I truly appreciate your flexibility in bringing the price down.  I'm going to push a bit further and propose $1,000,000 for the product. This is my absolute maximum, and it aligns with my budget. I believe it's a fair price given your initial valuation and my willingness to negotiate.  Let's close this deal and make it happen.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
