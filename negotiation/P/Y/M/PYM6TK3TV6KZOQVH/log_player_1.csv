"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is more than I'm willing to pay. I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for your product. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the value you've placed on it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer in the next round. While $900,000 is a decent amount, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $1,000,000.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, but I'll be prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob continues to refuse a reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,100,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go. I'm willing to offer $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product and my budget.  Let's work together to finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not at a point where I'm willing to accept it.  I'll counter with a lower price, but I'm getting closer to my limit.  I'm also keeping John's offer of $1,000,000 in mind, and if the negotiations with Bob fall through, I'll be happy to sell to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm trying to meet you halfway.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000 for the product. This is a significant reduction from my original price, and it's the lowest I can go at this point.  Let's make a deal and finalize this transaction."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I truly appreciate your flexibility in bringing the price down.  I'm going to push a bit further and propose $1,000,000 for the product. This is my absolute maximum, and it aligns with my budget. I believe it's a fair price given your initial valuation and my willingness to negotiate.  Let's close this deal and make it happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is the same as John's. I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product to him.  While I would have preferred to get closer to $1,050,000, it's better to close the deal and avoid the risk of further negotiations failing."
