"I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $11,000 is too low for me. How about $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $12,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $12,500, which would be $11,750. Would you consider that?",11750.0,Bob,4,
