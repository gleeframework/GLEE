"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $17,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $14,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which still leaves room for both of us to get a good deal. What do you say?",16000.0,Alice,3,
