Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the potential value, $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $1100000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still significantly lower than my minimum threshold of $1,000,000. I believe I can get a better price with further negotiation.  I'll proceed to the next round and counter Bob's offer."

Round 4

I'm still holding out for a higher price.  $1,150,000 is closer, but it's still below my minimum threshold.  I'll counter Bob's offer again, hoping to get closer to my target."
