"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value item that I'm confident you'll find valuable. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a fair and competitive price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1200000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $900000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I'd like to hear if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a significant amount, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value and the market demand, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering $1050000. This is a fair price that I'm confident you'll find reasonable, and it's a compromise that I'm willing to make to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $950000 for the product. This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can reach a deal at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $950000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to feel confident that we're at a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm counteroffering $1025000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's a fair price considering the product's unique features and benefits.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has unique features and benefits, but I still think $1025000 is too high. I'm willing to offer $975000 for the product. This is a fair price that I'm willing to pay, and I hope we can reach a deal at this price.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product, and I'm glad we're still in negotiations. However, $975000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to feel confident that we're at a price that reflects the product's value. I'm counteroffering $1050000 again, as I believe it's a fair price that balances our interests. However, I want to make it clear that this is my final offer, and if we can't agree on this price, I'll need to consider other options.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're making a final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $975000 and $1050000, which would be $1012500. I'm hoping we can agree on this price and finalize the deal.",1012500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to accept $1012500. I've already made a final offer, and I'm not willing to budge from $1050000. However, I'm willing to make a slight concession to try to reach a deal. I'll meet you at $1030000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If we can't agree on this price, I'll need to consider other options, including selling to John for $800000.",1030000.0,Alice,9,

"Alice, I appreciate your concession, but I'm still not comfortable with $1030000. I'm willing to meet you at $1025000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $800000.",1025000.0,Bob,10,
