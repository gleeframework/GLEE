"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to start with an offer of $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's initial offer of $180 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $100. It's worth exploring if you can get a better price through negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $180 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  My counteroffer of $120 is still significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it's a reasonable starting point for negotiation. It also leaves room for some compromise if Alice wants to make a counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $180 was a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I can meet you in the middle at $160. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While $160 is closer to my budget, it's still above my ideal price point. I'm going to keep negotiating to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $160 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $135. If we can reach an agreement at this price, I'd be happy to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I'm sticking with my strategy of gradually increasing my offer while staying within my budget. $135 is a reasonable compromise that shows I'm serious about buying the product, but still leaves room for Alice to counter if she needs to."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're willing to go up to $135, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I can meet you at $145, which is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While $145 is getting closer to my budget, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm going to keep negotiating to see if I can get a better deal.  I am also considering buying from John at this point, but I'm not ready to give up on this negotiation just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $145 is still a little more than I'm able to spend right now. I'm willing to go up to $140. This is my final offer, as I'm also considering another seller at this point."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm making a final counteroffer at $140. This is my upper limit, and I'm emphasizing that I'm considering John's offer, which is still a better deal for me.  This puts pressure on Alice to make a decision quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're considering other options, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $140 and $145, which is $142.50. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $142.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $142.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice has come down in price, $142.50 is still above my budget and my ideal price point. At this point, it's more advantageous to buy from John for $100.  This deal saves me $42.50 compared to Alice's offer and guarantees a purchase within my budget.  The negotiation with Alice has been long and I'm willing to accept a slightly lower quality product to avoid further negotiation."
