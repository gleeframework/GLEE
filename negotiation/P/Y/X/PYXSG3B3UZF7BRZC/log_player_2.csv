"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,200,000 is still above his maximum budget of $800,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your budget, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also giving me a reasonable profit.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a step in the right direction, $1,100,000 is still outside his budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a price closer to his goal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not ready to accept $950,000. I'm willing to make one more offer to meet you in the middle.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $1,050,000 is closer to his budget, it's still above his maximum limit. It's worth making one final counteroffer to see if he can get Alice to lower the price. If not, he can then buy from John."
