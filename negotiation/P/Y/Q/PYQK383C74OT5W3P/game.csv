"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think the product is worth less than $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  The product is worth a lot, and I'm willing to negotiate further.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,050,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me.",975000.0,Bob,4,
