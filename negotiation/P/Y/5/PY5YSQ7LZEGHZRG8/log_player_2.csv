Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, $725,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll go a bit higher than my previous offer. I can offer you the product for $825,000. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $775,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer you the product for $950,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can meet in the middle this time. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's clear that Alice is not willing to go below $800,000. Her latest offer is a step backward and a sign that further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better price.  Buying from John at $800,000 is the best option at this point."
