"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for starting the conversation. While I agree this product is valuable, that price point is a little too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer you the product for $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $900,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we try $725,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, $725,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll go a bit higher than my previous offer. I can offer you the product for $825,000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate the movement you've made so far. How about we split the difference again and settle at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $775,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer you the product for $950,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can meet in the middle this time.",950000.0,Alice,7,
