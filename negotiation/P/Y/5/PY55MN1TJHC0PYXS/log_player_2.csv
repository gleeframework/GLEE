The product is worth no more than $8,000 to you, and Alice's offer is significantly higher.  It's best to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to meet halfway between Alice's price and my maximum. This is likely to be rejected, but it sets the stage for further negotiation."

Alice's offer is still a bit too high, but it's getting closer. It's worth another round of negotiation to see if we can close the gap further."

This counteroffer is my maximum, but it's worth seeing if Alice is willing to meet me at this point. If she rejects, I'll go with John's offer."

Alice is not budging from her price, and it's getting closer to my maximum. It's time to take the sure thing and buy from John."
