"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. It's a unique and highly sought-after item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a fair and competitive price, considering its worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I believe this is a great starting point. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

You'll save $100,000 by accepting Alice's offer. While you could get it for $1,200,000 if you could negotiate Alice down further,  it's still a good deal compared to buying from John."
