{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget. There's potential to negotiate a better price, so rejecting the offer and counter-offering makes sense."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $950,000 is a bit high for me at this stage. I'm willing to pay $700,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate and potentially pushing Alice to compromise.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $825000. This is my best price for now, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $825,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm prepared to offer $750,000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Change:** This counteroffer increases your previous offer by a smaller amount, demonstrating you're moving toward a deal, but not giving in entirely. 
* **Fair Compromise:** The message reinforces the idea of finding a middle ground, making your offer seem more reasonable.
* **Closing Statement:** The message emphasizes your desire to finalize the deal at this price point, adding a sense of urgency."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm now offering the product to you for $825000 again, but this time it's non-negotiable. If you're interested, let's finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has stated her price is non-negotiable, it's still higher than where you'd like to be.  There's a chance that she's bluffing or that she'll change her mind if you push back.  Continuing to negotiate could potentially lead to a better deal, and you still have time before you need to resort to buying from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $825,000 is still out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $775,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's find a way to bridge the gap and get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 775000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  This counteroffer is a smaller increase than before, showing you're getting closer to Alice's position.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $775000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $825000 and $775000, which is $800000. I'm now offering the product to you for $800000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to your desired price, you still have some room to negotiate.  Rejecting her offer and counter-offering allows you to continue pushing for a lower price. You have a few rounds left, and you can still potentially secure a better deal.  Additionally, it's important to see if Alice is truly committed to her ""final offer"" or if she might be willing to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $800,000 is getting closer, but I'm still looking to get this deal done at a slightly lower price.  How about we meet in the middle at $787,500?  I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to come away happy."", ""product_price"": 787500}
```

* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes finding a price that makes both parties happy, creating a more positive and collaborative tone."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're close to your target price, Bob. However, I've already compromised significantly, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm now going to make a take-it-or-leave-it offer: I'll sell the product to you for $795000. This is my absolute final price, and I won't negotiate further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $795,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** Alice has clearly stated this is her final offer and won't negotiate further.
* **Close to Target:** $795,000 is very close to your desired price, and it's likely you won't be able to get much lower.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:** Rejecting this offer and counter-offering might lead to Alice walking away, forcing you to buy from John at a much higher price.
* **Limited Rounds:** You only have one round left, and it's not guaranteed that Alice will accept another counteroffer.

While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a much higher price outweighs the potential benefit of getting a slightly lower price.  It's a good time to accept and secure the product."
