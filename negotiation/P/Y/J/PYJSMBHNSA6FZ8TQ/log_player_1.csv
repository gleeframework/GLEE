Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer leaves room for negotiation, but it's still a good starting point. It's above my minimum of $800,000 but leaves significant profit potential for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $950,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below my desired minimum. I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $850,000 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value.  Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $875,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $875,000 is still above my minimum and within a reasonable range for both of us. It's also a better deal than selling to John."
