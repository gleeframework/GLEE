"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $1500000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with your decision.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I recognize its value, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it. This reflects a significant discount from your asking price and allows us both to make a deal.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1100000. This is a significant compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1500000. I believe this price is still a great deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1100000 is still a bit higher than where I can comfortably land right now.  I'm ready to offer $1050000. This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your persistence, Bob! I understand that $1050000 is a tempting offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $1080000. This is as close to your offer as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
