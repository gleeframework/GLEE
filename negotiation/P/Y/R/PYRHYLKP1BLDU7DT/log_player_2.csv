"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $1500000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's still room for negotiation.  Since you value the product at $1,500,000, a lower price is definitely achievable. By rejecting the offer, you can start a counter-offer process to potentially secure a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1100000. This is a significant compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1500000. I believe this price is still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe there's still room for further negotiation. I'm willing to continue the process and see if I can get a better deal.  Rejecting this offer allows me to continue to try and push for a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than where I can comfortably land right now.  I'm ready to offer $1,050,000. This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your persistence, Bob! I understand that $1050000 is a tempting offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $1080000. This is as close to your offer as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,080,000, which is very close to my last offer of $1,050,000.  It's likely that if I reject this offer, she might not come down any further. At this point, it's more beneficial to accept the offer and secure the product at a price that's significantly lower than John's offer of $1,500,000."
