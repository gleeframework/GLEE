Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum value of $15,000, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I'll see how Bob responds, and adjust my strategy based on his reaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm not interested in going through multiple rounds of negotiations, I am willing to compromise a little bit. I'll counteroffer with a price that's closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm offering $17,500. It's a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I still believe the product is worth more than his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to what I'd like to get. I'm willing to accept $16,000. It's a good price, and further negotiation might not be worth the time and effort. I'd rather close the deal now."
