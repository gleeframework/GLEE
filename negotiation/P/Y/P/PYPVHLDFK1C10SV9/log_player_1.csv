Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1500000 price point. I am willing to pay up to $1200000 for the product. I hope this revised offer is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is exactly the minimum price I'm willing to accept, I'll choose option 1.
