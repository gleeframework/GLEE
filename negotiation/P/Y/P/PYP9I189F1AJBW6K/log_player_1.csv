"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm aiming high to maximize potential profit. Starting at $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant gain above my minimum.
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:**  This first offer will help me understand how eager Bob is to purchase and how flexible he might be in the negotiation.
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm keeping in mind that I have John as a backup buyer at $800,000. This knowledge allows me to be more assertive in the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but  $1,100,000 is a little too high for me. Would you consider $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $850,000 is above my minimum selling price, but it's still significantly lower than his perceived value of $1,200,000. There's plenty of room for negotiation. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price by rejecting this offer and proposing a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, $850,000 undervalues the product significantly. To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to let it go for $1,000,000. This price reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've come down from my initial offer, signaling to Bob that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Holding Firm:**  The $1,000,000 counteroffer is still a strong price, closer to my starting point and well above my minimum.
* **Justification:**  By emphasizing the product's value, I'm reiterating that my offer is reasonable and encouraging Bob to meet me closer to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,000,000 is getting closer, but I'm aiming for something around $900,000. Would that be feasible? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is tempting, I believe Bob is willing to go higher. His language (""getting closer"", ""aiming for"") suggests he's still negotiating and has room to move. I'll reject this offer to push for a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price, and I want to make this deal happen. How about we settle on $975,000? This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your negotiation."",
""product_price"": 975000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Movement:**  I've made a substantial drop in my asking price ($25,000) to signal my willingness to close the deal. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** The offer of $975,000 is a strong position â€“ halfway between my previous offer and his, and still a significant profit margin for me.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By framing it as a way to ""make this deal happen,"" I'm subtly introducing a sense of urgency without resorting to hardball tactics."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer! I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. How about $937,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $937,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $937,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $937,500 is a substantial profit, exceeding my minimum by $137,500.
* **Meeting Halfway:** Bob's willingness to meet in the middle signals a genuine desire to finalize the deal.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly higher price, but the potential gain is likely small compared to the risk of losing the deal altogether. It's better to secure a great price now."
