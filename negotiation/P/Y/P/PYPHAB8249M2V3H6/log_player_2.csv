Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has value,  $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $720,000.  I believe that's a fair price that considers both our interests."", ""product_price"": 720000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $720,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? I believe this is still a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer to my budget.  However, $850,000 is still a stretch for me. To make this work, I could go up to $750,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not able to go as low as $750,000. Let's try to find some common ground. How about $800,000? This is my absolute minimum, and it's still a good deal for both of us.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000

**Reasoning:** Alice has met your baseline price. There's no point in continuing the negotiation or going to John, as you won't get a better price."
