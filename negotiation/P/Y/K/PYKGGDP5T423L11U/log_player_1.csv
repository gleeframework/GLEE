"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1100000} 

I'm starting with a high price, aiming to get as close to Bob's value as possible without giving away too much in the first round.  This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my ideal price, it's still higher than selling to John. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price with some negotiation.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to secure a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm making a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It signals a willingness to compromise while still trying to secure a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $975,000 is getting closer to my desired price.  While I'd ideally like to get even closer to my goal of $1,100,000, it's a good compromise.  The risk of further negotiation is that Bob could lower his offer again, or I could run out of rounds and be forced to sell to John for a lower price.  Therefore, it's best to accept this offer to secure a profit that is significantly higher than selling to John."
