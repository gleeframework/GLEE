Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $90? It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
