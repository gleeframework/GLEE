"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $120 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is less than your maximum budget of $150, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($80). This indicates there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $90? It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $90 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $100. This price still allows me to make a profit, and it's a fair compromise. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now $100:** This is a significant drop from her initial $120 and is within my acceptable range ($150 maximum).
* **Profit for Alice:**  Even at $100, Alice is still making a profit as the product is worth $80 to her. 
* **Negotiation is likely to continue:** If I reject this offer, there's a chance Alice may counter again, potentially pushing the price closer to $90. However, there's also a risk of her sticking to her $100 or even going back up to her initial $120.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential gain from further negotiation is minimal (saving $10). The risk of not getting the product at this price (and having to buy from John for $150) outweighs the potential reward. 

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Alice's offer of $100 is the most rational choice, as it balances my desire to save money with the need to avoid unnecessary risk and potential delays."
