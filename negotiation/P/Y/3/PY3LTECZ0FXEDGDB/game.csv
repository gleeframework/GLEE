"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $11,500 is a good starting point, I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This still gives you a great deal on a valuable product, and it's closer to what I'm looking for. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,3,
