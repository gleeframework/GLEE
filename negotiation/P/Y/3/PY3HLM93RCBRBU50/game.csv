"Hi Alice, $200 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $100 for it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $170. This is a fair price for a product of this quality. What do you say?",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $170 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $120. This is a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can both be happy with the deal.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. How about $155?  That's a significant reduction from my original offer and reflects my willingness to make a deal.",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $155 is still too much for me.  I'm firm on $120.  This is a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal.",120.0,Bob,6,
