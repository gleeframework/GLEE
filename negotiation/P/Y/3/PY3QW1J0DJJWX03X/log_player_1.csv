Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000."", ""product_price"": 1450000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired selling point. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Above Bob's Value:** The initial offer is intentionally above Bob's perceived value to test his willingness to pay a premium.
* **Below John's Offer:**  The offer is still significantly below John's standing offer, ensuring a profit even if Bob negotiates down.

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while keeping the offer attractive enough to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $1,050,000 at this time.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below both your minimum acceptable price and John's standing offer. There's ample room for negotiation before considering accepting an offer below $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to find a fair deal, that price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Could you consider $1,325,000?"", ""product_price"": 1325000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Decrease, But Above Minimum:**  This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate while still remaining well above both Bob's initial offer and your absolute minimum.
* **Midpoint Strategy:** It aims for roughly the midpoint between the previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, a common negotiation tactic to signal movement toward a potential agreement.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By staying above John's offer, you retain the option to walk away from the negotiation with a guaranteed sale if needed. 

This strategy keeps the negotiation moving forward, testing Bob's flexibility while protecting your interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,325,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly moving towards a more reasonable price, but his current offer is still below your guaranteed sale with John. It's worth one more attempt to negotiate a better deal before accepting a price lower than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, it seems like we're getting closer. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  I believe this reflects the product's value while acknowledging your budget considerations."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  This offer represents a smaller decrease compared to previous rounds, signaling that you're nearing your bottom line.
* **Above John's Offer:** It keeps the price strategically above John's offer, preserving your leverage and ensuring you maximize potential profit.
* **Final Push:** This counteroffer aims to encourage Bob to make a final move, ideally closer to your desired price point. 

This approach balances firmness with flexibility, increasing the chances of closing a deal with Bob at a favorable price while keeping your alternative option open."
