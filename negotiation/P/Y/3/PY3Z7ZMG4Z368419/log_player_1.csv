Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a good starting point, as it's above my minimum acceptable price of $120, but also leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to pay closer to his value of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
While I would prefer to sell for closer to $140, Bob's offer of $130 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120.  Accepting his offer is the best course of action in this round to ensure a sale."
