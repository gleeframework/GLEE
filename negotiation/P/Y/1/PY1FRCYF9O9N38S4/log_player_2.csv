"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product that I think you'll love! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident will bring a lot of value to your life. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to me is no less than $10000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save money.  Since John is willing to sell the product for $12,000, and that's Bob's maximum budget, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer.  Rejecting Alice's offer means Bob can still get the product at his maximum price from John."
