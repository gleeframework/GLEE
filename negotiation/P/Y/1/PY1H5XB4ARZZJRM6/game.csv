,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70 for the product. I'm really interested in it, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $70 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",85.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $70 is a bit low for you, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $70 and $85, which would be $77.50. Can you consider this offer?",77.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $77.50 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $82.50. This is a fair compromise, and I believe you'll find the product to be well worth the investment. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",82.5,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $81.25 is still a little below what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go down to $81.75. It's almost there! Let's finalize this deal and make sure you get this valuable product.",81.75,Alice,7,
