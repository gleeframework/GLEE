"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! I'm willing to let it go for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

This offer is much higher than your maximum budget and John's offer. It's worth negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $100 for it. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
```

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it leaves room for negotiation while staying under your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob, but $100 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but the price is still above both your budget and John's offer. There's room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about $110? That's a fair price, and I'm ready to buy if you agree."",

}
```

We're pushing closer to your limit, but it's still important to try and get a better deal than John's offer. This price is a good balance between showing you're serious while leaving a little room for Alice to potentially come down further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to give you a bit more wiggle room, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good price. I'm counteroffering at $130. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and you're running the risk of her sticking to a price above your budget. John's offer at $120 is your best option at this point."
