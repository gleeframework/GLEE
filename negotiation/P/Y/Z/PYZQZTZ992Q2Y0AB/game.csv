"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $20,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to be flexible to get this deal done. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  However, $14,000 is still a bit above what I had in mind. Would you be open to a price closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
