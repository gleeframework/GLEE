,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 is a compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than $110.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $95 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $105. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows us both to walk away feeling satisfied with the deal.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think we can get closer to the middle. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $100.50. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it.",100.5,Bob,6,
