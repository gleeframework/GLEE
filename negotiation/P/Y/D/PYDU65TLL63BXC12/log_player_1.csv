Round 6

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to reach a compromise. However, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my budget.  I'm willing to offer $905,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget constraints.  Let's work together to make this deal happen.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000.  We've reached a point in the negotiation where I'm not confident I can get a price higher than $905,000 from Bob, and that's still below my minimum acceptable price.  It's time to move on and take the sure thing with John."
