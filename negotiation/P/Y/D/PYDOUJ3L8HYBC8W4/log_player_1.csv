"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115.  It's a great deal and I think you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price just above Bob's perceived value of the product. This should pique his interest while still giving me room to negotiate down if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $90 is significantly below my minimum asking price. I'm willing to come down a little bit. Would you consider $105? This would still give you a great deal on a valuable product."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. I'm aiming to find a middle ground that both of us can agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $97? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $97 is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll continue to negotiate with Bob in hopes of reaching a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer, $97 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $101? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 101}
``` 

I'm trying to stay firm on my minimum price while also demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.  This offer shows a commitment to reaching a compromise."
