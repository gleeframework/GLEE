Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $90?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $90 is significantly below my minimum asking price. I'm willing to come down a little bit. Would you consider $105? This would still give you a great deal on a valuable product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer, $97 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $101? This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $101. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $101
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is very slowly lowering her price. At this rate, it's unlikely we'll get a deal significantly better than what John is offering. It makes more sense to take the guaranteed $100 deal from John rather than risk getting stuck with a higher price from Alice."
