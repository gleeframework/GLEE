"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1200000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to offer $1000000 for the product.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer $1150000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I'm still confident it's a great deal for you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1150000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $1050000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price we can both be happy with.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I've already come down $50000 from my initial offer. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'll counteroffer $1075000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I'm still confident it's a fair price for this exceptional product.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
