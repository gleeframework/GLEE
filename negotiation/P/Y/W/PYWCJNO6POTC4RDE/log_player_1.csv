"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 950000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation. This allows me to maximize my profit while still giving Bob an incentive to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it is still below my minimum desired price of $800,000.  I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating with Bob to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer remains the same, which means he's not showing much flexibility.  I'll reject it and see if I can get a higher offer in the next round.  I'm still hopeful that I can reach a price that's closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000} 
```

I'm continuing to lower my price, but this time by a smaller amount, signaling that I'm getting closer to my acceptable range.  This might encourage Bob to make a more substantial counteroffer."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is still below my ideal price, it's above my minimum threshold, and we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds.  It's better to secure this deal than risk losing Bob and being forced to settle with John for a lower price."
