,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is around $100.  Would you be willing to consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $145. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $145 is still a bit out of my range. I'm committed to getting this product, and I'm willing to go up to $120. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",120.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your commitment to getting the product, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. I can offer it to you for $132.50. It's a fair price, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get the product at a good value.",132.5,Alice,5,
