"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great opportunity for you, Bob! I'm willing to sell this amazing product to you for $180. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
This is a clear case of rejecting Alice's offer. $180 is well above your maximum budget of $100. It's worth negotiating, even if it means potentially buying from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is around $100.  Would you be willing to consider $110?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $145. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $145 is better than $180, it's still above your maximum budget of $100. It's worth continuing to negotiate. There's still room to bargain and potentially reach a price you're comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $145 is still a bit out of my range. I'm committed to getting this product, and I'm willing to go up to $120. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 120} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your commitment to getting the product, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. I can offer it to you for $132.50. It's a fair price, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get the product at a good value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $132.50 is still above your budget of $100.  You've negotiated for several rounds, and it seems Alice is not willing to go lower.  You have the option to continue negotiating, but it's likely to be a long process with no guarantee of success. 

It's better to cut your losses and buy the product from John for $100.  This ensures you get the product within your budget, even if it means missing out on potentially a better deal with Alice."
