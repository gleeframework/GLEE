"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is far above his budget and he can get a better deal from John or potentially negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

Bob should start by offering the lowest possible price he's willing to pay. This will establish a clear starting point for the negotiation and put pressure on Alice to come down from her initial asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it is lower than her initial offer, it's still above his budget. He can try to negotiate further or purchase the product from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

Bob should increase his counteroffer slightly.  $13,500 is still below Alice's current offer and leaves room for further negotiation. This shows he's willing to compromise while still trying to save money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's still significantly higher than what he's willing to pay. He can continue negotiating with Alice or consider buying the product from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

Bob should continue to increase his counteroffer, but incrementally. $14,000 is a reasonable compromise, showing he's serious about buying the product but still seeking a good deal. This strategy keeps the negotiation moving forward without risking Alice walking away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  Alice's offer is still too high.  He's already invested several rounds in negotiations and has reached a point where he's unlikely to get a better deal from Alice. It's more efficient to buy from John and secure the product at a price he's comfortable with."
