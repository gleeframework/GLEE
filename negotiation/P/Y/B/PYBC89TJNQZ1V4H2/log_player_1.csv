"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a strong offer that is slightly below Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $1,400,000, I signal that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I believe the product is worth a significant sum. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  The message aims to be positive and engaging, encouraging Bob to respond and reveal more about his position. This will help me understand his willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is a good chunk above my minimum, I know he's willing to pay more. It's still too early to settle. I'll counter in the next round to try and close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the market value. However,  the product's unique features and  potential benefits warrant a higher price point. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,325,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's true value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1325000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm coming down from my initial offer but not drastically. A $75,000 decrease shows flexibility but maintains my position that the product is worth more than Bob's initial counteroffer.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique features"" and ""potential benefits"" reinforces the product's value proposition and provides a reason for my counteroffer.
* **Seeking Common Ground:** The tone remains collaborative. I want to find a solution that works for both of us and emphasizes finding a ""fair compromise."""
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I still think $1,200,000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that takes into account the product's unique features and potential benefits. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now very close to my initial counter-offer, and this deal is significantly above my minimum selling price. Holding out for another $25,000 isn't worth the risk of him walking away or significantly dropping his offer in later rounds. It's time to secure a profitable deal."
