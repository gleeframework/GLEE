"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the market value. However,  the product's unique features and  potential benefits warrant a higher price point. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,325,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's true value. What do you think?",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I still think $1,200,000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that takes into account the product's unique features and potential benefits.
