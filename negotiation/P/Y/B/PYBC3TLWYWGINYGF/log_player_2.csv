{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for a lower price than $12,000.  It's worth rejecting the offer and seeing if you can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice values the product at $8,000.  A counteroffer of $9,000 is still a good deal for both parties, and is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer.  This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay.  You have more rounds to negotiate, and you can likely get a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows for more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, lowering her price from $12,000 to $11,000. This counteroffer shows you're serious about buying the product but still want a good deal. It's a small increase from your previous offer, increasing the chances of Alice accepting."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price significantly from her initial offer, and $10,500 is within your budget.  It's a good deal for you, and accepting the offer ensures you get the product without further negotiation or the risk of going to John."
