The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $1,350,000. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. After considering your offer, we've decided to counter with a proposal of $1,300,000 for the product. We believe this price reflects the value of the product while still allowing for a reasonable profit margin for us. We hope this aligns better with your budget and look forward to your consideration.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's counteroffer of $1,300,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Since there's no guarantee that further negotiation will lead to a lower price, it's best for Bob to buy the product from John for $1,200,000."
