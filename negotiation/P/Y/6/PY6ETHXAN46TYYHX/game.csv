"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your product and see its potential, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for it. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a reasonable profit margin for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. After considering your offer, we've decided to counter with a proposal of $1,300,000 for the product. We believe this price reflects the value of the product while still allowing for a reasonable profit margin for us. We hope this aligns better with your budget and look forward to your consideration.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
