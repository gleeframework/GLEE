"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth more to me than to Bob. This will hopefully encourage him to counteroffer, allowing us to find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold of $150. I'm going to try to push for a higher price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still aiming for a profit. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I won't settle for too low of an offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still not comfortable with $130.  While it's closer to my minimum, John is offering me a better deal. I'm going to counteroffer again to see if I can get Bob closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm making a small compromise by lowering my price to $160. I'm hoping this will be enough to sway Bob towards a deal while still ensuring I make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is only $10 above my minimum, and we're already halfway through the rounds. I don't have time to risk further negotiation and might end up with a price lower than John's offer.  It's best to secure the $150 from John now."
