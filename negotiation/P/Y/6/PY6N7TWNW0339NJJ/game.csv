"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a competitive price.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you consider a lower price, perhaps around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit in price.  While $850,000 is closer, it's still a touch outside my budget. How about we settle at $775,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you at $800,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,5,
