"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, the product is worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your life and business. What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your target price point, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not ready to give up on the higher price point just yet. I'll meet you at $845,000, which is still a good compromise considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $845,000.

Alice is clearly committed to staying above $800,000.  While we could likely negotiate a bit lower, the difference at this point is less significant compared to the risk of Alice walking away or the guaranteed savings of buying from John.  $845,000 is a reasonable compromise."
