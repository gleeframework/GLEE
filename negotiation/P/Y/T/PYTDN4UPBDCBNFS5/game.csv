"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to discussing further.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it brings. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit. However, $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000, which is a fair price for both of us. This is my final offer, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price.",800000.0,Bob,4,
