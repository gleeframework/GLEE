{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this great product that you're interested in. I'm asking for $130 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts at a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but leaves room for negotiation. This strategy aims to secure a higher price while leaving room for a potential compromise if Bob counters. It's important to keep in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $120 at any time, so I'm not desperate to accept a low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! $130 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low, as the product is worth at least $120 to me. While I'm open to negotiation, I won't accept a price that's significantly below its value. I will counteroffer and see if we can find a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $115?  I'm willing to work with you, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this product."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  How about $105? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still not quite there. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to sell the product for less than $120. I'll counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $105 is still a bit low for me.  Let's try $110.  I'm open to finalizing a deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 110}
