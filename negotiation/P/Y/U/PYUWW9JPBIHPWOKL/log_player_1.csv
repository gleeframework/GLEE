{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts high, but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm aiming for a price closer to Bob's value, but I'm still leaving myself a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 feels a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but $110 is below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $110 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to go down to $125.  That's still a good price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 125}
