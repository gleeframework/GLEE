"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 feels a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that we're looking for a good deal.
* **Polite and Interested:**  The message remains polite and expresses continued interest in the product, encouraging further negotiation.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By starting low, we aim to move the negotiation closer to a price that's beneficial for us while staying within a reasonable range of Alice's valuation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $110 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to go down to $125.  That's still a good price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice meeting in the middle at $125 is a reasonable compromise. It gets us a price significantly lower than John's offer and closer to Alice's perceived value, making it a win-win situation."
