Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer if he wants to negotiate, while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Secure a Good Deal:**  Even if Bob rejects this offer, you have John as a backup buyer at $12,000, ensuring you don't lose money."
