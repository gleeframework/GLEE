Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I've already compromised on the price. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $8,200?

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $8,200, and it's not worth the risk of further negotiation. Buying from John for $8,000 guarantees the best price."
