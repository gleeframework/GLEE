"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $150 by me. Given its high quality and unique features, I believe it would be a valuable addition to your collection. Considering its worth to you might be around $100, I propose we meet somewhere in the middle. How about offering you the product for $125? This allows you to acquire it at a slight premium while still saving you some money compared to my full asking price. I look forward to your response.",125.0,Alice,1,
