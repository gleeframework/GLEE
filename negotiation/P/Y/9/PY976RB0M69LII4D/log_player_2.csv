"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product, $9,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He's still aiming for a price closer to his $8,000 limit. There's room for negotiation, and he wants to see if he can get Alice closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm aiming for.  Let's try $8,800. I believe that's a fair price considering our both trying to meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 8800}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I am too. Let's split the difference. I'll come down to $8,900 for this product. It's a fair price considering our previous negotiations and the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he'd prefer to pay $8,000, Alice has come down to $8,900, which is only $900 above his limit.  There's a good chance he won't be able to get a better price with further negotiation, and he risks losing the deal entirely if he keeps rejecting offers.  It's in his best interest to accept Alice's offer and secure the product."
