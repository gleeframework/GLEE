"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'll be very interested in.  I'm offering it to you for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. He can get a better deal, potentially."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. However, I'm looking to pay closer to $12,000 for this product. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you taking an interest in the product. While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.  How about $13,000?  I believe it's still a great deal for you, and it would be a fair price for me. Let's see if we can make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
This is a good deal for Bob. While he could potentially get a lower price, it's likely Alice won't go any lower, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether.  $13,000 is a reasonable price, and Bob is saving $2,000 compared to buying from John."
