"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'll be very interested in.  I'm offering it to you for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts at a point where I believe I can get a good price, while still leaving room for negotiation. I'm confident that Bob will find the product valuable, and I'm open to discussing the price further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. However, I'm looking to pay closer to $12,000 for this product. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still negotiate a better price.  I want to try and get closer to my original ask of $14,000. The fact that Bob is interested and willing to negotiate gives me confidence that I can get a higher price with further discussion."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking an interest in the product. While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.  How about $13,000?  I believe it's still a great deal for you, and it would be a fair price for me. Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:** 

I've moved slightly from my original offer, but I'm still aiming to get as much as possible.  Offering $13,000 shows I'm willing to compromise, while still leaving some room for negotiation in case Bob wants to haggle further."
