"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $18000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $18000 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit, and $12000 is below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $15000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $13000. It's a fair compromise, and it's the absolute most I can afford.  Let me know if this works for you.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, $13000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you at $14000, which is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,
