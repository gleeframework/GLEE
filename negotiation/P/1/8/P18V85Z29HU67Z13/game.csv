"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. Can we meet in the middle at $10500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you have a limited budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer, so I'll make a new offer of $11000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10250. I'll make a new offer of $11250, which is still a compromise, but reflects the product's true value. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",11250.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to meet you at $10000, which is my absolute maximum budget. I'm not sure I can go any higher",10000.0,Bob,6,
