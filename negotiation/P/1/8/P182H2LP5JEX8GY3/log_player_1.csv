"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident I can get a higher price than John's offer, but I want to be sure I don't lose Bob completely by starting too high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum desired price of $15,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm going to counter with $10,000. This is still higher than Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm hoping this will be a sweet spot where Bob sees value and I can secure a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling at that price. I believe I can get more, especially since I have more rounds to negotiate.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to counter with $10,500. This is a small increase from my last offer, but I believe it shows that I'm serious about getting a good price, while still leaving some room for negotiation. I'm hoping this will be enough to entice Bob without pushing him away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,750 is close to my minimum, I still want to see if I can get a bit more. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a slightly higher price in the next round. I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10250}
```

I'm going to counter with $10,250.  It's a small increase, but I'm hoping this will be enough to close the deal. With only a few rounds left, I need to start making concessions.  I'm confident that Bob will see the value in this offer and finally accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,625. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,625
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, I'm running out of time to get a higher price from Bob.  While I'm disappointed I couldn't get closer to my desired price, $15,000 from John is still a good deal.  I'm going to sell to John."
