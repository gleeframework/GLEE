"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe this price reflects its true value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's initial offer is above your maximum budget. It makes sense to negotiate and try to get a lower price. You have the fallback option of buying from John for $800,000, so you have some leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $700,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering it leaves room for you to still make a decent profit."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price leaves room for negotiation. The message is framed positively, emphasizing fairness and a potential win-win situation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not comfortable dropping that much. I'm prepared to offer you the product for $750,000.  This price is still fair for both of us, and it leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's find common ground and get this done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down in price, but it's still above your ideal price and even above what John is offering.  There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm getting closer to a price point where I can make this work. How about $725,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 725000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Splitting the difference:**  This counteroffer meets Alice halfway between her last offer ($750,000) and your previous offer ($700,000). This strategy often signals a willingness to compromise and find a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Framing:** The message continues to emphasize fairness and finding a solution that works for both parties. This collaborative tone can help facilitate a smoother negotiation process.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While closer to Alice's price, this counteroffer still leaves some room for her to potentially counter again, allowing for a potential agreement without having to resort to John's offer yet."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $725,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $737,500. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to get a good deal.  Let's finalize this and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $737,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $737,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice has, once again, met you halfway. While the offer is still slightly above your ideal price, it's now less than John's offer. Continuing to negotiate for a small difference at this point might risk alienating Alice and losing the deal altogether. It's a good compromise to accept the $737,500 offer."
