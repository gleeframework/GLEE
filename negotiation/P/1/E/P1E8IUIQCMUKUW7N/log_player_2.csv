It's better to reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer. You can potentially get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still get great value from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:

While Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. It's worth trying another counteroffer to see if you can get closer to your target price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,875 is still below where I need to be.  Let's try $9,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  What do you think?

Alice is getting closer to your desired price, but it's still above your limit. At this point, it's more beneficial to buy the product from John for $8,000 and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
