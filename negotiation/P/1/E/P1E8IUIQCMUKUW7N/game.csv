"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm only able to pay $8,500 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still get great value from the product.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,250 is still a bit more than I can afford right now. How about we meet in the middle at $8,875? It's a fair price, and it allows us both to walk away happy.",8875.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,875 is still below where I need to be.  Let's try $9,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,5,
