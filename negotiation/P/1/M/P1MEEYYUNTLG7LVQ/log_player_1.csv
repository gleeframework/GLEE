Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a fantastic product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $150. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since John acts as a safety net, willing to pay your minimum price, you should aim higher with Bob to maximize potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  A starting price of $150 gives Bob room to negotiate down, potentially meeting somewhere above your minimum. 
* **Gauge Interest:** This initial offer also helps gauge Bob's interest level. If he outright rejects it, you haven't lost anything, as you have John as a backup."
