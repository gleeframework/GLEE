""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you and this is a competitive price."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($12,000).
* **Alternative Buyer:** Having John as a backup buyer guarantees you at least $12,000.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $14,000 creates a win-win situation:
    * Bob saves $1,000 compared to his perceived value.
    * You earn a significant profit above your minimum selling price. 

This offer attempts to strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the deal."
