Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but the offer of $600,000 considerably undervalues the product's capabilities and potential.

Otherwise, I'll need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 800000}"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I value your straightforward approach. I've tried to be flexible, but I need to be upfront: $1,000,000 is the very lowest I can go for this product. It represents a significant investment on my end, and I'm confident it will more than prove its worth to you in the long run. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear that $1,000,000 is her absolute bottom line. This exceeds your maximum budget of $800,000. Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a price you're willing to pay. John offers a guaranteed price within your budget, making it the most logical choice at this point."
