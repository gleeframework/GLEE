"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Its value is significant, and I believe it can greatly benefit your endeavors. I'm initially offering it at $1,500,000. This reflects its true worth and potential ROI.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is too high for me.  I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but the offer of $600,000 considerably undervalues the product's capabilities and potential.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is a significant reduction, reflecting my desire to see this product benefitting you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, there's still a significant gap between our valuations. To be frank, $800,000 is my maximum budget for this product. If you're willing to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today.  Otherwise, I'll need to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I value your straightforward approach. I've tried to be flexible, but I need to be upfront: $1,000,000 is the very lowest I can go for this product. It represents a significant investment on my end, and I'm confident it will more than prove its worth to you in the long run.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
