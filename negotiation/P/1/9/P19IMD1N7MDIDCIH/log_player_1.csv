Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $15,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$15,000:** This is a starting point that's higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  I'm being friendly and optimistic while clearly stating my price. 

This approach allows for a potential negotiation, but also sets a firm starting point to protect my interests.  I'm also keeping John in mind as a backup option in case the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Can you meet me in the middle at $13500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'm confident that there's room for further negotiation.  Rejecting Bob's counteroffer allows me to:

* **Set a stronger bargaining position:** By rejecting, I show I'm not desperate and am willing to walk away if necessary.
* **Increase the likelihood of getting a better price:** A counteroffer from me might incentivize Bob to raise his offer.

This approach keeps my options open and increases the potential for a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $13,500 is closer, it's still a bit below my ideal selling price. I'm willing to come down to $14,000.  This would be a fair compromise, and I believe it still represents a good deal for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and expressing my willingness to compromise, while still staying above my minimum.  I'm framing $14,000 as a fair compromise to encourage Bob to accept.
* **$14,000:** This price is a reasonable counteroffer that leaves room for potential further negotiation, but also keeps me comfortably above my minimum value. 

By offering this counteroffer, I am showing flexibility while remaining confident in the value of my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $13750. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $13,750 is now very close to my minimum value of $12,000.  While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, the risk of further negotiation could lead to a lower offer, or even a stalemate. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale at a price that is still profitable for me, minimizing the risk of losing the sale altogether.

The potential for further negotiation is present, but the risk of losing the deal outweighs the potential gain. I'm confident that $13,750 is a good deal for both of us, and I'm happy to close the deal."
