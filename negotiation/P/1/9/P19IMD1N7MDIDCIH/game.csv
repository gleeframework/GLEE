"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Can you meet me in the middle at $13500?",13500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $13500 is closer, it's still a bit below my ideal selling price. I'm willing to come down to $14000.  This would be a fair compromise, and I believe it still represents a good deal for you. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $13750. Can you consider that?",13750.0,Bob,4,
