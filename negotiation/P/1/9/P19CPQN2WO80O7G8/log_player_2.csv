"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $20,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is way above your budget and your maximum valuation. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $20,000 is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay.  I could consider a price closer to $10,000."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** While $10,000 is still a significant jump from your $8,000 walk-away point, it's important to start the negotiation significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This leaves room for bargaining and signals that you're serious about getting a good deal.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is polite and acknowledges Alice's offer, but it's also firm in stating that $20,000 is unacceptable. 
* **Gauging Alice's Flexibility:** This counteroffer will give you a better idea of Alice's flexibility. If she's willing to move significantly from her initial price, there's a chance for a deal. If she's stuck close to $20,000, you can always walk away and go with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, the product is worth $8,000 to you, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. This is my final offer for now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice has come down in price, $14,000 is still significantly higher than your $8,000 walk-away point. 
* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** Be wary of ""final offer"" statements. It's often a negotiation tactic.  
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still room to negotiate. You can try to bring the price down further without revealing your absolute maximum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $14,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we meet somewhere around $11,500? I'm eager to find a price that works for both of us."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Approach:** We're moving in smaller increments now ($2,500 down from our previous offer), signaling that we're getting closer to our limit.
* **Expressing Willingness:** The message emphasizes finding a mutually agreeable price, showing that you're serious about making a deal. 
* **Maintaining a Buffer:** $11,500 is still a safe distance from your $8,000 alternative, giving you some bargaining room if Alice pushes back."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're still looking to save some money, Bob. However, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'll meet you at $13,000. This is my last offer, and I expect it to be final. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Don't Be Pressured:** Alice is using time pressure and the ""final offer"" tactic again. It's important not to fold under pressure, especially since we're still above our walk-away point.
* **Slow and Steady:**  It's better to continue with smaller concessions and see if Alice will budge further. A large jump on your part could signal that you're willing to pay more than you are. 
* **John is Still an Option:**  You have a safety net with John, so you don't need to feel pressured to accept a price that's not in your best interest."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $13,000 is getting closer, it's still a little bit out of reach for me right now.  Would you consider $12,000? That would make a big difference for me."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Progress:** We start by recognizing that progress is being made to maintain a positive tone.
* **Small Concession:** We're sticking to smaller concessions ($1,000), signaling that we're nearing our limit without revealing our absolute bottom line.
* **Appealing to Motivation:** The phrase ""make a big difference for me"" subtly implies that we might be struggling to afford the higher price, potentially encouraging Alice to be more flexible. 
* **Avoiding Ultimatums:**  We're not using any ""final offer"" language ourselves. Keeping the negotiation open-ended gives Alice a chance to reconsider without feeling pressured."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500. This is my last concession, and I expect it to be accepted. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Pattern Recognition:** Alice keeps using the ""last offer"" tactic, but she keeps coming down in price.  This suggests she's still willing to negotiate, even if she says otherwise.
* **Testing the Waters:** We're only $500 away from our last offer. It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to meet us at $12,000 or at least split the difference.
* **Backup Plan:**  You still have John's offer as a safety net if the negotiation falls through. Don't feel pressured to settle just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're right, we are getting close! $12,000 seems like a fair compromise to me, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Creating a Sense of Urgency:** By stating that you are ready to ""close the deal,"" you introduce a sense of urgency without resorting to ultimatums.
* **Standing Firm:**  You've repeated your $12,000 offer, signaling that this is a serious price point for you. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message maintains a positive and collaborative tone, encouraging Alice to agree without creating conflict.
* **Calculated Risk:** There's a chance Alice could walk away, but it's a risk worth taking. You've come down significantly in price, and you have a good alternative with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go any lower than $12,500, Bob. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth. If you're not willing to meet me at $12,500, I'm going to have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Alice has made it clear she won't go below $12,500. You've been firm at $12,000. There's little point in continuing the negotiation.
* **Limited Rounds:** You only have one round left. Even if you could get Alice to budge a little more, it's unlikely you'll reach an agreement in time.
* **Acceptable Alternative:**  John's offer of $8,000 is a much better deal than $12,500. You'll save a significant amount of money by going with him.

**Sometimes the best negotiation is knowing when to walk away. You've negotiated skillfully and secured yourself a great price with John!**"
