Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I know it's incredibly valuable to you, and I believe a price of $2,000,000 reflects its worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Strategic Overpricing:**  By offering the product at $2,000,000, you aim to gauge Bob's interest level. If he accepts immediately, you've secured a fantastic deal. If he negotiates, you can potentially still settle above your minimum.
* **Confidence:** The message conveys confidence in the product's value, potentially influencing Bob to accept a higher price. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your price during negotiations, but never go below your $1,500,000 safety net (John's offer)."
