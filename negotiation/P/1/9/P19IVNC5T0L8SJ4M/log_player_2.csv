"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to us and we believe it's a great value for you too. Considering its worth to both of us, let's aim for a fair price. How about we start at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $110 is a decent price, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget of $100.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $110 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given the value of the product to both of us, how about we aim for $100? This is still a good profit for us and within your budget range. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $100 is exactly Bob's maximum budget. While he could potentially try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee of success. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at the best possible price within his budget and avoids the risk of losing the deal to John."
