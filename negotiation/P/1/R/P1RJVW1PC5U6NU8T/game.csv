"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me and leaving room for a mutually beneficial deal.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $1,050,000 is a fair offer, I'm still hoping for a bit more to make this worthwhile for me.  Let's find that middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price represents a significant discount from my initial offer and leaves room for both of us to be satisfied.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
