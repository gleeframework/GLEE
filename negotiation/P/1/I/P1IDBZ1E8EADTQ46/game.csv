,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $16,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is significantly less than what I had in mind.  Let's meet somewhere in the middle, how about $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a higher price, but $13,000 is still too high for me. I could potentially go up to $7,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, it seems like we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $11,000.  This is my final offer, as I already have another buyer lined up.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $11,000 is still a bit above my budget, I understand you have other offers. Would you consider $8,000? That would be my absolute maximum.",8000.0,Bob,6,
