I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good deal. This also gives me room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

$10,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering a price that's halfway between Bob's offer and my initial offer, hoping to find a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, and it's the same as what John would pay. It's not ideal, but I'm willing to take it and avoid further negotiation."
