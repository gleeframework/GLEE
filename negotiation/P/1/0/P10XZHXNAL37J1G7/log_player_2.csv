Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $1200000? This still gives you a great deal, and it's a price that I can realistically accept. Let's try to find a compromise here.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $1050000?
