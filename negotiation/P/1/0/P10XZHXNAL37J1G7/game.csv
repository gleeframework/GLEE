"Bob, I'm offering you a truly unique and valuable product. It's worth at least $1000000 to me, and I believe it has the potential to be even more valuable to you. To start, I'm offering it to you for $1500000. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $1500000 is far too high for me. Given my budget and the information you've provided, I'm willing to offer $800000. This is my best offer, and I believe it's fair considering the potential value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $1200000? This still gives you a great deal, and it's a price that I can realistically accept. Let's try to find a compromise here.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1200000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This represents a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $1050000?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and hopefully closer to your desired price. Let's try to finalize this deal. I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're getting close.  I'm willing to meet you at $975000. This is a reasonable price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to close this deal. Let's not let this opportunity slip away.",975000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $975000 is still a bit out of my reach.  I'm willing to go up to $925000.  This is my final offer, and it represents a significant investment for me. I'm confident this is a fair price that allows us to both reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's close this deal.",925000.0,Bob,8,
