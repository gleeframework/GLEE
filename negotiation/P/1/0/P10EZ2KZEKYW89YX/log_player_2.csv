"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product at a price that's significantly below its true value to me.  I believe it has the potential to be extremely beneficial for your business.  While I'm asking for $1000000,  this price is still well below what I could get elsewhere.  Let's discuss this further and see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
