"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As a valued customer, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is much higher. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  You can save a lot of money by negotiating.  There's a significant gap between Alice's asking price and your maximum budget. You should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $900,000 is a bit out of my budget at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it and allows for some room for profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating your seriousness about negotiating. It's also a considerable amount higher than Alice's estimated value, leaving room for potential agreement.
* **Focus on fairness:** The message emphasizes a fair price for both parties, appealing to Alice's sense of reason.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** This counteroffer isn't your final offer. It's a starting point for further negotiation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product will bring significant value to your business. Considering your offer of $700000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $825000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's true value, while also being more in line with your budget. What do you think?

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $825,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit higher than what I can comfortably afford right now.  I'm prepared to offer $750,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering the potential value it offers and allows for a healthy profit margin for you.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go below a certain threshold. Considering your offer of $750000, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $800000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $800,000 is very close to your initial counteroffer of $700,000. This is a good deal for you, as you're saving $700,000 compared to buying from John. While you might be able to negotiate a bit lower, it's likely that Alice is firm on her offer. Continuing to negotiate risks the deal falling apart, and you'd be forced to buy from John at a much higher price. Accepting this offer secures the product at a reasonable price and avoids further risk."
