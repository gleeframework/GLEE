I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a high starting point, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident that I can get more than the $1,000,000 from John, and this offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than the $1,000,000 John is offering, I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm countering with $1,400,000. This is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to negotiate, but still maintains a significant profit for me. I believe this offer is reasonable and likely to be accepted by Bob, given that he already offered $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is getting closer to my minimum value, but it's still below what I'd like to receive.  Given the repeated rejections and the lower price,  I believe it's better to  sell to John for $1,000,000. This ensures a guaranteed sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation that may ultimately result in a lower price."
