"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm excited to hear your thoughts on this revised offer.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective on the value, $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the product's full potential.  I'm willing to compromise and come down to $1,000,000. This price still provides a significant profit for me while allowing for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me, and I'm willing to make a final concession. What are your thoughts on this revised offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,
