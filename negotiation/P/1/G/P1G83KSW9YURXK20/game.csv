"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  How about $105?  I'm serious about buying it, but that's my top price.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $105 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110.  That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you want to get a good price for the product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still only comfortable at $105. If you're unable to go that low, I'll have to go with John's offer.  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,4,
