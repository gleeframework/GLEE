Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, our goal is to maximize profit. Offering it to Bob first gives us a chance to potentially earn even more.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  We set the price at $1,100,000. This is:
    *  Significantly above Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000, giving us room for negotiation.
    *  Below John's guaranteed purchase price, ensuring we still make a good profit if Bob declines.
* **Sense of Urgency and Exclusivity:** The message emphasizes a limited-time offer and mentions other interested parties to encourage Bob to act quickly."
