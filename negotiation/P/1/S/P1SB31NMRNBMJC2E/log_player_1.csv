Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a price of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. I'm open to discussing a slightly adjusted price if you have any concerns."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to meet in the middle if you're willing to compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm aiming for a higher price. While $900,000 is better than selling to John, I think I can still get closer to my ideal price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is closer to what I'm hoping for, I can only go down to $950,000. This price still leaves room for you to profit significantly while allowing me to achieve a fair return on my investment."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $950,000, which would be $925,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $925,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price. I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired $950,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time between $925,000 and $950,000. I'm confident that $937,500 is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 937500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I still think we can do better. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000 again, but I'd like to add a small concession on my part. If you're willing to meet me at $925,000, I'll throw in an additional service that's worth $5,000. This way, we both benefit from the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for me. I get a price close to my target and a bonus service on top of it. While I can still try to get a little more, it's likely that I won't get a better offer in the remaining rounds. It's time to close this deal."
