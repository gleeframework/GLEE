Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but still lower than my minimum ($150). This gives Bob room to negotiate while ensuring I make a profit.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and encouraging message will hopefully increase Bob's willingness to negotiate. 
* **Flexibility:** I'm leaving the door open for counteroffers, but I'm ready to walk away to John if Bob is unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Profit:**  $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's room for further negotiation. While $90 is closer to my minimum, I can potentially get closer to my ideal price with another counteroffer.

**Next Steps:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about $100? It's still a great price for the value you'll get, and it's closer to what I need to make this work. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, showing willingness to negotiate. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm emphasizing the value the product provides, reminding Bob that even at $100, he's getting a good deal. 
* **Flexibility:** I'm keeping the door open for further negotiation if needed. 

**Strategy:** I'm aiming for a middle ground that allows both of us to walk away with a win.  I'm still above my minimum price, but I'm willing to adjust further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $85? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Threshold:** Bob's offer of $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **No Room for Negotiation:** Further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to result in a price that meets my minimum. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price of $150, ensuring I don't lose money on the deal.

**Decision:** It's not worth continuing to negotiate with Bob. I'll sell to John for a guaranteed profit."
