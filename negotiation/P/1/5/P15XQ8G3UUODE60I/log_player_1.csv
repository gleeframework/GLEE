"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable piece, and I believe it would be a great asset to your business.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing that Bob values the product at $800,000. This gives me room to negotiate down and still make a profit. I'm also including a friendly message to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to offer $950000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I have more rounds to negotiate with Bob, and I believe I can get a better price.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I have more negotiating leverage with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This would still allow you to get a good deal, and it's a fair price for the value I'm offering. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm coming down slightly from my initial offer, but still keeping the price above my minimum threshold. I'm using this round to show that I'm open to negotiation, but also emphasizing the value of the product. I'm hoping this counteroffer will convince Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value of your product and my budget, I would like to propose $1050000 as a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is finally above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I'm willing to accept his offer to secure the sale. There are still rounds remaining, but I'm taking advantage of a good offer and avoiding the risk of further negotiation."
