Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $850,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000.

While $775,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still a bit too low. I'll see if I can get closer to my target in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your perspective. However, $775,000 doesn't quite cover my costs.  How about we settle on $800,000? This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you. It also allows me to cover my costs and avoid selling to John for the same price.  Let me know if you're willing to agree to this final offer."", ""product_price"": 800000}
