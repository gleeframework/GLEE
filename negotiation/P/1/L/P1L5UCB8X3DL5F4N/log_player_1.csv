Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could offer it at $150, there's a chance Bob will accept a slightly lower price, netting me a profit.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $140 leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he wants to haggle, potentially still landing above my minimum.
* **Urgency:**  The ""limited time"" phrase adds a bit of pressure for Bob to decide quickly.

This strategy aims to find a balance between securing a deal with Bob at a profitable price and not losing out on the guaranteed $150 from John."
