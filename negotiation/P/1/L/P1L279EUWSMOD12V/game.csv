"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's worth $1,500,000 and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to you.  Let's start with a price of $1,750,000. This gives you room to negotiate, and allows me to get a fair return on my investment. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value it brings to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a fair deal. Let's move forward and make this happen.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer, but $1,600,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle at $1,350,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 simply isn't enough for me to let go of this product.  It's a unique opportunity and I'm sure you'll agree it's worth a little more.  Let's try $1,450,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product, and hopefully gets us closer to a deal.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close! I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,400,000?  That feels like a win-win for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,400,000 is still slightly below my minimum acceptable price. To make this deal work, I need to see $1,450,000. This is a fair price that reflects the unique value of this product and brings us closer to a successful conclusion.  What do you say?",1450000.0,Alice,7,
