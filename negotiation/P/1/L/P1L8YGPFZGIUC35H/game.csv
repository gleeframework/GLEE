"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $150 is a bit steep for me. How about $125? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $125 is a good starting point, but I'm hoping we can find a middle ground. How about $135? It's still a great deal for a product of this quality. Let's see if we can close this deal.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $135 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $130.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",130.0,Bob,4,
