"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $9,500?  That's a fair price considering the value of this product to you.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $9,250?",9250.0,Bob,4,
