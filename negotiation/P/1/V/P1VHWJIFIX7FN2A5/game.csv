"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $900,000 is certainly a respectable figure, I believe the true value of this product sits significantly higher.  Would you consider $1,100,000? I'm confident you'll find this to be a worthwhile investment.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're confident in the product's value, but I'm still not convinced that $1,100,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
