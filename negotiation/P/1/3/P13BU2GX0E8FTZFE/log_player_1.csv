Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to see a bit more flexibility on the price. Let me know what you think!

# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your revised offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $11,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to me. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $11,000 again. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to me. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob keeps repeating his offer of $11,000, and I'm starting to feel like we're going in circles.  I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not comfortable going any lower.  I'm going to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $12,000.  It's not ideal, but it's a guaranteed sale and it's better than continuing this negotiation with Bob."
