Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

Since John is willing to pay $1,200,000, which is the minimum acceptable price for me, there's no reason to offer Bob a lower price.  By offering the product at $1,200,000, I maximize my potential profit. 

Here's why:

* **If Bob accepts:** I get my desired price.
* **If Bob rejects:** I still get my desired price from John.

This strategy ensures I get the best possible outcome, regardless of Bob's decision."
