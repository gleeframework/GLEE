"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I can see you're a serious buyer, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $11,000. This is the lowest price I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to think about the value I'm bringing to the table. I can do $11,250, which is as low as I'm willing to go. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",11250.0,Alice,5,
