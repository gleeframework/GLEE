"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to let it go for $90. How about we meet in the middle at $100? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting closer to your price, Bob! But I still need to make a profit. How about we try $102? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a fair compromise. What do you think?",102.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close!  I'm willing to go up a little bit. How about $97?",97.0,Bob,6,
