Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll appreciate its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by giving Bob a price that is above your minimum but still leaves room for bargaining. It also uses positive language to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. While I could accept and get some money, it's not worth sacrificing so much. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is simply too low.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,500? This would still give you a great deal, and allow me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 14500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  How about we settle at $13,000? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $13,000 is close enough to my minimum that it's worth accepting.  It's better than selling to John for $15,000, and continuing to negotiate might take too long and risk losing the deal altogether."
