"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity to get something truly valuable. I believe it's worth more than what others might be willing to pay, but I understand everyone has their own valuation. Considering its worth to me and the market value, I propose a price of $100 for this product. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us.",100.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $80, which is the price I'm willing to pay. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and find a mutually beneficial price.",80.0,Bob,2,
