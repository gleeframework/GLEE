"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity to get something truly valuable. I believe it's worth more than what others might be willing to pay, but I understand everyone has their own valuation. Considering its worth to me and the market value, I propose a price of $100 for this product. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I'll reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer. I'm looking to save as much money as possible, and $100 is still a bit above my budget of $80.
