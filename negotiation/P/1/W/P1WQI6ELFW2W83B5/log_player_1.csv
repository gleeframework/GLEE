"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm offering it to you for $110, which is a great price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's closer to my minimum value ($120) to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm leaving some room for negotiation ($10) to incentivize Bob to accept the offer, but also to protect my profit margin. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and friendly tone to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming to me first.  That price is a little high for me, though. Would you be willing to consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $60 is significantly below my minimum value of $120.
* **Opportunity for Counteroffer:**  I have room to negotiate and can likely get a better price from Bob.
* **Selling to John is a backup:** If negotiations fail, selling to John guarantees my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $60 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $90? That's still a good price for you and allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:**  $90 is a compromise, significantly higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my initial offer.
* **Reiterate value:**  I'm highlighting the ""good price"" for Bob to emphasize the potential value.
* **Show flexibility:** I'm demonstrating my willingness to negotiate by reducing the price, making it more likely Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  I'm trying to stick to a tight budget, though. Could we meet in the middle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $75 is still below my minimum value of $120. 
* **Room for compromise:** While Bob is getting closer, there's still room to negotiate a higher price.
* **Selling to John remains a good option:** I can still secure my minimum value by selling to John if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be fair here, but $75 is still too low for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway, how about $85?  That way, we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price that's exactly in between my previous offer ($90) and Bob's offer ($75). This shows a genuine effort to compromise and reach an agreement.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm highlighting that ""we both get a good deal"" to emphasize the benefits of accepting the offer.
* **Maintaining a Margin:** $85 is still above my minimum value of $120, ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I can do $80 for it. That's the absolute most I can offer, but it would help me out a lot. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Minimum:** While $80 is just above my minimum acceptable value ($120), it's a good deal considering Bob is unlikely to go higher.
* **Limited Rounds:** We're in round 6, and with limited rounds remaining, it's risky to continue negotiating and risk losing the deal.
* **Time Value:**  It's important to consider the time spent negotiating. Closing the deal now ensures a quick sale and minimizes the potential for delays.

**Conclusion:** Accepting Bob's offer is the best option, ensuring a quick sale while still meeting my minimum value requirement."
