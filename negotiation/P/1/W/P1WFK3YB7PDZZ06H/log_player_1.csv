"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to be the sole owner of this unique product.  Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally advisable to begin negotiations with an ambitious offer. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potential counter-offer. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's ""unique value"" and ""immense potential"" helps justify the high initial price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message explicitly mentions this is an ""initial proposal,"" signaling openness to discussion and potential price adjustments."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we start the conversation at $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below both your minimum price and his own perceived value of the product. Accepting would mean a substantial loss for you. It's far more strategic to engage in further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $600,000 is significantly below its true market value.  This product is one-of-a-kind and offers immense potential return on investment.  I'm willing to meet you halfway – let's consider $1,050,000."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection with Explanation:**  You clearly reject Bob's initial low offer but provide a reason (""significantly below market value"") to encourage a more serious counter.
* **Highlight Value:**  Reiterating the product's uniqueness and potential value helps to justify your higher price point.
* **Strategic Concession:** Offering to ""meet halfway"" creates the impression of compromise, but you're actually anchoring the negotiation closer to your desired outcome. Bob offered $600,000 and you started at $1,500,000 – the midpoint is $1,050,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. That said, $1,050,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're still in the early stages of negotiation, and Bob is moving in the right direction, though slowly. While $800,000 is better, it's still a significant amount below your target price and John's standing offer. Continuing to negotiate keeps the possibility of a better deal on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. Let's settle this right now. How about $950,000? This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** The message conveys a sense of firmness while aiming for a mutually agreeable outcome. 
* **Final Offer Tactic:** By presenting it as your ""final offer,"" you introduce a sense of urgency and potentially encourage Bob to make a serious decision.
* **Strategic Price Point:**  $950,000 represents a significant concession from your previous offer but still secures a substantial profit above John's guaranteed offer."
