"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we start the conversation at $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $600,000 is significantly below its true market value.  This product is one-of-a-kind and offers immense potential return on investment.  I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ let's consider $1,050,000.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. That said, $1,050,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. Let's settle this right now. How about $950,000? This is my final offer.",950000.0,Alice,5,
