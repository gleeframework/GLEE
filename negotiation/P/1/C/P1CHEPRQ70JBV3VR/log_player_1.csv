"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price, aiming for the best possible outcome. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  $1,750,000 is still a significant profit for Bob, leaving room for negotiation without risking a quick rejection. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is quite high. While I'm interested in the product, my budget is $1000000. Would you consider lowering your price to that amount? Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would be a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, it shows his interest. I can still negotiate with him to reach a more profitable price.
* **Time for a Counteroffer:**  I have 8 rounds left.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and hopefully find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $1,000,000 is far too low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,375,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Middle Ground:** I'm offering a price that's significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise while still achieving a decent profit.
* **Appeal to Reason:** I'm emphasizing the benefits for both of us, highlighting the ""great deal"" for Bob and the ""fair profit"" for myself.
* **Collaborative Tone:** I'm using language that emphasizes collaboration and finding a mutually beneficial solution, aiming to maintain a positive negotiation dynamic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1375000 is closer to my budget, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1000000.  Would you consider a price of $1150000? This would give us both a good deal, and it would help us close this transaction sooner. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Accepting it would mean a significant financial loss.
* **Room for Further Negotiation:** While Bob's offer is closer to my ideal price, I'm confident that I can still negotiate a better deal.  I've already shown flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining Control:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to retain control of the negotiation and guide it towards a more favorable outcome for me.

I'll counter with a price closer to my desired price point, aiming to find a middle ground that both of us can agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire to close the deal quickly, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,150,000 is still too low for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,250,000? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progressing Towards Agreement:**  I'm increasing the price slightly from my previous offer, but it's still a considerable discount from my initial price and closer to Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise and find a middle ground.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:** I'm framing the price as ""fair"" and ""reasonable,"" highlighting the value of the product and my need to make a profit.
* **Enthusiasm and Urgency:** I'm using positive language and expressing excitement about closing the deal to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1250000 is still above my budget. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. How about $1100000? This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that allows you to make a profit. Let's make this happen! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Accepting it would be a significant financial loss. 
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:** While I want to reach a deal, I have only 4 rounds left.  If I continue to accept offers below my minimum, I risk losing valuable time and potentially having to sell to John for a lower price than I'd like.
* **Opportunity for a Counteroffer:**  I can still counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range. There's a chance Bob might be willing to compromise further, especially as we get closer to the deadline. 

I will continue to negotiate with Bob, aiming for a price that is closer to my minimum acceptable price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're both trying to find common ground.  While $1,100,000 is still too low, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This allows us to both achieve a good outcome and close this deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's last offer. This shows a willingness to compromise further and meet him closer to his desired price point.
* **Emphasizing Win-Win:** I'm emphasizing the ""good outcome"" for both of us, highlighting how this price would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Closing the Deal:**  I'm emphasizing urgency and the importance of finding a solution ""that works for both of us,"" encouraging Bob to accept the offer and finalize the transaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. While $1200000 is closer to my target, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1000000. How about $1125000? This is a significant compromise for me, and I believe it's a fair price that allows you to make a profit and allows me to stay within my budget. Let's finalize this deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** With only two rounds left, the chances of Bob coming up to my minimum price are slim. 
* **Significant Loss:** Accepting Bob's offer of $1,125,000 would mean a substantial loss for me, as I'm still far below my desired profit. 
* **Guaranteeing Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This ensures I don't take a significant financial loss and secure a good profit.

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, the remaining rounds and the risk of a lower price are not worth the potential loss. Selling to John guarantees a profitable outcome."
