"Alice, your offer is quite high. While I'm interested in the product, my budget is $1000000. Would you consider lowering your price to that amount? Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $1000000 is far too low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $1375000? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1375000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1375000 is closer to my budget, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1000000.  Would you consider a price of $1150000? This would give us both a good deal, and it would help us close this transaction sooner.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to close the deal quickly, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1150000 is still too low for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1250000? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's make this happen!",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1250000 is still above my budget. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. How about $1100000? This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that allows you to make a profit. Let's make this happen!",1100000.0,Bob,6,
