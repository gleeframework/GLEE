"I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $12,000 is too low for me.  This product offers significant value, and I could sell it for $15,000 to someone else. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $18,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000, but that's as high as I can go. Would you consider that?",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thanks for sticking with the negotiation. I understand your position, but I need to get a bit closer to my target. How about $16,000? That's a fair compromise, and it allows me to make this worthwhile.",16000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to walking away, but I really like the product. I can do $14,500, that's as low as I'm willing to go. Please let me know if that's something you'd be willing to accept.",14500.0,Bob,6,
