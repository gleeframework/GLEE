"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe would be incredibly valuable for you.  I'm asking for $11,500. I think it's a fair price considering the benefits it offers. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Could we perhaps negotiate the price down to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer is very low and leaves me with no profit. It seems unlikely he'll go much higher quickly.  I'd rather take the guaranteed profit.
