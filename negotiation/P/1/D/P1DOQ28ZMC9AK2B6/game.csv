"While I appreciate your offer, $900,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product. It's a fair price considering its value, and allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, Bob. However, I was hoping to get a bit closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $875,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into acquiring it.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice, but $875,000 is still a bit out of my range. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to go up to $825,000. This is a significant commitment on my part, and I believe it reflects the product's value while staying within my budget.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $825,000. Considering the product's value and the fact that you're already making a significant concession, I'm willing to meet you at $850,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",850000.0,Alice,5,
