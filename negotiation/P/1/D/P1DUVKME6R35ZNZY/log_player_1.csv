{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to sell it for $12,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price. $9,500 is still a bit low, but it's a good starting point for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and go with $10,750? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand you need to make a profit, but $10750 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $10000.  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $10,000 is getting closer to my desired price. While I'd like to get a bit more, it's a fair price and worth accepting to avoid further negotiation and potential risk of losing the deal."
