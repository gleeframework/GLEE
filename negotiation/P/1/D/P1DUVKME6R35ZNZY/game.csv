"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to sell it for $12000.  What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9500 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and go with $10750? It's a fair price for both of us.",10750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand you need to make a profit, but $10750 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $10000.  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
