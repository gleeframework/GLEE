"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to sell it for $12000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a good deal, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a strong counteroffer:** Bob wants to make a significant jump down from Alice's initial offer, showing he's serious about getting a lower price.
* **Don't be afraid to lowball a little:** $9,500 is still a good profit for Alice (more than $1,500 above her own valuation).
* **Be polite and respectful:** Bob maintains a positive tone to keep the negotiation friendly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9500 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and go with $10750? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,750 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob still has room to negotiate. He's aiming for a price closer to $9,500.  Rejecting allows him to continue trying to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand you need to make a profit, but $10,750 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,000.  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show willingness to compromise:** Bob demonstrates that he's open to negotiating and finding a middle ground.
* **Appeal to fairness:**  The offer of $10,000 is presented as a ""fair price for both of us,"" which can be persuasive.
* **Keep the pressure on:** By emphasizing the need to close the deal, Bob encourages Alice to make a decision."
