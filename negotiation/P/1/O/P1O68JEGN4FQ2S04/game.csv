"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm still confident that the product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value. Let me know if you're interested!",11000.0,Alice,3,
