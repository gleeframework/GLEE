"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special. I'm willing to offer it to you for $2000000.

"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $500000 to $700000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid $600000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1200000. This is a compromise that I believe is still a great value for the product. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I am still unable to meet you at $1200000 due to my financial constraints. I am proposing a counteroffer of $900000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but I need to get closer to my original price. I'm offering $1100000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go. If you're still interested, let me know.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I am still unable to meet you at $1100000. I am proposing a final counteroffer of $1050000. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget constraints.",1050000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you've made a final offer, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $1050000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but it will be my last. I'm offering $1200000. If you're still interested, let me know. If not, I'll consider selling it to John for $1500000.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
