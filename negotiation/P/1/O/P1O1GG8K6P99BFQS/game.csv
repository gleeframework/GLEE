"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $5,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  That gives you a good deal, and I can still make a profit.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $8,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch. Would you consider $6,500? That's a significant price difference, but I'm hoping we can make a deal.",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to negotiate, but $6,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $7,500, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's make a deal!",7500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting close! I can do $7,000.  That's a really good offer, and I'm ready to close the deal today if you agree.",7000.0,Bob,6,
