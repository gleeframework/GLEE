"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate the product's value, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,050,000? I believe that's a fair price and represents a good deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is too far below my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This reflects the value of the product and is still a great deal for you.  Let's try to find common ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,250,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,100,000.  This price point represents a substantial investment on my end while still acknowledging the value of your product.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're aiming for $1,100,000, but that's still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,175,000.  This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.  Let's try to reach a final agreement.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
