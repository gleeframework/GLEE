"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the potential value in your product, I'm hoping to secure it for a slightly lower price.  I'd be willing to pay $1000000 for it.  This reflects the value I've determined for my business, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I acknowledge your perspective, $1000000 doesn't quite reflect the true worth of this product. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This price still ensures a fair deal for both of us.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $1100000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to offer $1050000.  This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this point.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
