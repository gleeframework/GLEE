"Bob, I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for you. I'm offering it to you at $950,000, reflecting a significant discount from its true market value. This is a price that's fair for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, that price is a bit high for me right now. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is simply too low for me. Considering the value this product holds for you, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair compromise and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I need to stay within my budget. Could we meet halfway at $775,000? That would be a fair compromise.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to be flexible but $775,000 is still too far below what this product is worth.  I'm firm on $825,000. This price recognizes the value you'll gain while remaining fair for me. Let's get this done.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle at $800,000?  That seems like a fair deal for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,6,
