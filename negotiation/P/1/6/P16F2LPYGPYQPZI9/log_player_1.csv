{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $9,500 is higher than Bob's valuation of $8,000, but it leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:** $9,500 is still above your minimum of $10,000, giving you some wiggle room if you need to lower the price. 
* **It's a strong opening:**  A strong opening price often leads to a better outcome in negotiations. 

By starting at $9,500, you're setting the tone for the negotiation while still leaving room for a mutually beneficial outcome."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value for the product. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."

While $8,750 is closer to my minimum, I still need to make more than that to make this worthwhile.  I'll try one more counteroffer before moving on to John."

Bob is unwilling to go above $8,500, and I'm not willing to sell for that low.  While I'd prefer to make a deal with Bob, I'm confident that John will pay my minimum price of $10,000.  It's time to move on to John."
