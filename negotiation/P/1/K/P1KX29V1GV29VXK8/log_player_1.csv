"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you at a competitive price. How about $11,500? Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of something a bit more reasonable. How about $10,800? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum threshold of $10,000. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price, especially since Bob has already shown interest. I believe I can leverage this interest to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,800 is a bit too low for me.  Let's compromise.  How about $11,200?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll still find it a good value."", ""product_price"": 11200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $11,200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $11,000? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $11,000 is very close to my desired price and well above my minimum threshold of $10,000. Accepting this offer allows me to secure a decent profit and avoid further negotiation that could potentially lead to a lower price or a stalemate. It's also important to note that I'm already halfway through the negotiation rounds, and any further rejection could lead to selling to John at a lower price."
