"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of something a bit more reasonable. How about $10,800? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that.",10800.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,800 is a bit too low for me.  Let's compromise.  How about $11,200?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll still find it a good value.",11200.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $11,200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $11,000? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",11000.0,Bob,4,
