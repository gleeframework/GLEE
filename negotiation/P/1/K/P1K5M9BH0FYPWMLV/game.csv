"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a fair price. I'm starting at $115. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a little steep for me.  Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $90 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $105 is the lowest I can go.  It's a great deal for you, and still allows me to make a decent profit.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, Alice.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $97.50. That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I can't go that low.  $100 is my absolute bottom line.  If you're serious about buying, I'm willing to close the deal at that price.",100.0,Alice,5,
