Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's still a fair price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for negotiation, but still significantly lower than the product's value to Bob. This allows for a win-win scenario, where I earn a good price and Bob gets a great deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get a better deal.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9,500.  This is a significant price reduction for me, but I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $9,500, which would be $9,250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,250 is close enough to my desired price that I'm willing to accept it. It's still a good profit for me and a good deal for Bob. I'm confident that I can't get a significantly better price from Bob, and if I reject this offer, I risk losing him as a buyer and having to settle for the lower price from John."
