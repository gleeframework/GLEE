"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable value, but I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate down from there. If he rejects, I'll have a better understanding of his perceived value and can adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable value, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground and close the deal in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good profit and above my minimum acceptable value.  We're getting closer to a deal and I don't want to risk losing this buyer completely."
