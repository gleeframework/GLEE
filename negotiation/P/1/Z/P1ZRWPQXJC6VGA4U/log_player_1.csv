I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation and potential compromise while still exceeding my minimum acceptable value.  I'm confident that Bob, knowing the product's worth to him, will be motivated to negotiate."

I'm offering a counteroffer of $1,380,000.  This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still remaining above my minimum acceptable price.  It's a signal that I'm serious about reaching an agreement with Bob, but also that I'm not willing to settle for a price that undervalues the product."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,360,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's still slightly below my initial target, it's very close and I'm confident that further negotiation might not yield a significantly better price.  It's important to remember that the negotiation process has a cost in terms of time and effort.  $1,360,000 is a good outcome, exceeding my minimum acceptable value, and  ensures a quick and successful sale."
