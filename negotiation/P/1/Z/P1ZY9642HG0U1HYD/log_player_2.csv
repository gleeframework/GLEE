Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $1250000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's worth and potential, I believe a price of $1350000 would be a fair compromise. This would still leave you with a good deal and allow me to achieve a more reasonable price. What do you think?

``` 

Bob should reject the offer. He's still trying to get the price down to his maximum of $1,200,000. While $1,350,000 is closer, it's still too high. He can continue negotiating with Alice or buy from John."
