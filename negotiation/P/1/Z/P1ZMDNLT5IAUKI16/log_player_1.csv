Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially get more than Bob's perceived value.
* **Justification:** While I haven't explicitly stated why the product is worth $15,000, the phrasing ""significant value"" suggests there are compelling reasons. 
* **Gauge Interest:**  This offer serves as a way to gauge Bob's interest. If he flat out rejects it, I know he might be very price-sensitive. If he counters, it opens up the negotiation. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. I'm prepared to negotiate with Bob and potentially lower the price, but I want to aim high initially."
