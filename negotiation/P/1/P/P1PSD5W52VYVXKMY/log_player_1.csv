"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive message:** I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Value proposition:** I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob, which may increase his willingness to pay. 

I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and how the negotiations progress."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is my minimum:** While $120 is my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell at that price right away. There are still 9 rounds left.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  Bob's message indicates he's interested in the product. By rejecting his offer, I can try to get a higher price.
* **Leveraging John:** Knowing John is willing to pay $120 provides a safety net. I'm not risking losing the sale entirely by rejecting Bob's offer. 

I'll use the next round to propose a counteroffer that's closer to my initial price, hoping to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest! While $120 is my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my initial asking price. How about $135?  It's a fair compromise and a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a lower price than my initial offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Justification:** I'm giving Bob a reason to consider the counteroffer (fair compromise).
* **Still above minimum:** $135 is still above my minimum, allowing for some profit while potentially getting a better deal than John's offer.

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be attractive enough for Bob while still giving me a reasonable profit. I'll adapt my strategy based on Bob's next response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $135 is a compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to meet me halfway between $120 and $135? That would be $127.50 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal. I'm hoping to get a little more.
* **Negotiating space:**  I'm not desperate to sell, and there are still 6 rounds left to negotiate.  
* **John's offer as backup:**  Knowing John will pay $120 gives me the confidence to continue negotiating with Bob.

I'll counter Bob's offer with something slightly higher, aiming to find a midpoint where we both feel comfortable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming closer to my price.  $127.50 is a fair compromise, but how about $129?  It's a small difference and would make a significant difference to me."", ""product_price"": 129}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small increment:** I'm proposing a small increase over Bob's last offer, showing I'm willing to compromise but still want a better price.
* **Emphasis on value:**  I'm reminding Bob that this small increase will mean a lot to me, hoping to appeal to his sense of fairness.
* **Still above John's offer:** I'm staying above John's offer, ensuring a profit even if Bob rejects my counteroffer.

I'm cautiously optimistic that this offer will be acceptable to Bob, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go down to $125? It's still a bit above my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** Bob's offer of $125 is very close to my minimum of $120.
* **Limited rounds:**  We're down to only 4 rounds left.  
* **John's offer:**  While John's offer is $120, I'm not guaranteed a sale with him.  Bob seems motivated, and there's a good chance he'll accept my next offer. 

I'm willing to accept this offer and secure the sale with Bob rather than risk losing a deal with both parties."
