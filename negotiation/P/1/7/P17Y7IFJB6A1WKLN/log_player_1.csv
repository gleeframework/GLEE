Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant returns you'll reap."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, meaning any offer above this has the potential to be profitable for him.
* **Maximizing Profit:** While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows us to potentially secure a higher profit margin.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $1,350,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly advantageous for us if accepted. It ensures Bob sees potential value (a potential $350,000 profit) while still netting us a substantial profit above our minimum. 

This approach balances risk and reward. If Bob accepts, we secure a great deal. If he rejects it, we have our fallback option with John."
