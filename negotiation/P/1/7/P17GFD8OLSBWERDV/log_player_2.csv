Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering this product, which holds immense value to me, for $1500000. I believe it could be a game-changer for you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$1,500,000 is way over your budget. It's best to reject the offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it.  This is a fair price, considering my maximum budget. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your offer. However, $800000 is significantly lower than the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1200000, which reflects its potential for you. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,200,000 is better than $1,500,000, it's still above your budget. You can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $800,000. This is my absolute limit. Let's see if we can reach a compromise."", ""product_price"": 800000}
