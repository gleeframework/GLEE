Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion."", ""product_price"": 2300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product,  that initial price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  However, the value of this product is significantly higher than your initial offer reflects. I could consider a price of $1,900,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,900,000 is still a ways away from what I had in mind.  To be frank, I can get this for $800,000 from another seller.  If you're willing to come down to $700,000, we have a deal.  Otherwise, I'll have to go with the other offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is playing hardball and has revealed his maximum willingness to pay is $800,000. It's clear he's trying to pressure me into a deal far below my minimum acceptable price.  I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000, which is much more favorable than anything Bob is likely to offer."
