"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product,  that initial price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  However, the value of this product is significantly higher than your initial offer reflects. I could consider a price of $1,900,000. This takes into account the product's potential but also provides some room for negotiation.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,900,000 is still a ways away from what I had in mind.  To be frank, I can get this for $800,000 from another seller.  If you're willing to come down to $700,000, we have a deal.  Otherwise, I'll have to go with the other offer.",700000.0,Bob,4,
