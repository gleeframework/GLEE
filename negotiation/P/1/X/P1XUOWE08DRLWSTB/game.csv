"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your proposal, but I believe we can find a better solution for both of us. I am willing to pay $950,000 for your product.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a good deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm glad you've come down to $1,100,000. While this is closer, I would like to propose $1,050,000 as a compromise. This allows us to move forward with a mutually beneficial transaction.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to work towards a deal.  However, $1,050,000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $1,125,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",1125000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice, and I appreciate your effort to reach a compromise. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your latest offer at $1,125,000. I am prepared to offer $1,100,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair compromise that respects both our needs.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
