"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1100000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $1,200,000 is way over his budget, and he can get the same product from John for a much better price.  It makes sense to try to negotiate with Alice, but even if he fails, he has a backup option with John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,200,000 is significantly outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $850000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $950000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $950,000 is closer to his budget than her initial offer, it's still more than he wants to spend.  He can get the same product from John for a much better price ($800,000), so rejecting Alice's offer and continuing to negotiate is the best option.  If he can't get a lower price from Alice, he still has a backup with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate but $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair price for both of us considering the value we each place on the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're willing to go up to $900000, but I'm still not sure if that's enough to meet my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to reach an agreement. I'm thinking of $980000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  While Alice has come down in price, $980,000 is still more than Bob is willing to pay.  It's better to buy the product from John for $800,000 than to continue negotiating with Alice and risk her refusing further offers."
