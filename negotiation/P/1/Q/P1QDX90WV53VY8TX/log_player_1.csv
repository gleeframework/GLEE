While Bob is trying to negotiate, it's clear he's not willing to meet a price point that represents the product's value to me. Taking his increasingly aggressive tactics into consideration, it's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap. Selling to John ensures I receive the minimum value I've placed on the product."
