Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer of $1,800,000 is a bit too high for me.  Given my research and the market value of similar products, I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while leaving room for both of us to make a profitable deal.
