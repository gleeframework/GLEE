"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer of $1,800,000 is a bit too high for me.  Given my research and the market value of similar products, I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while leaving room for both of us to make a profitable deal.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $1,300,000 is certainly a strong offer, I believe this product's unique value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This allows us both to benefit while acknowledging the true worth of what's being offered.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,600,000, but that's still a bit high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $1,450,000 for the product. This price is fair considering the market value and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us.",1450000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thanks for your continued engagement.  I understand your perspective and am motivated to find a solution that works for both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,525,000? This price reflects the true value of the product while recognizing your initial investment offer.",1525000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,525,000 is closer, I'm still a bit hesitant.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again and offer $1,487,500. This price reflects a fair compromise and brings us closer to a mutually beneficial deal.",1487500.0,Bob,6,
