"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $1,050,000? This price is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it would be a good deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is still a bit below my target price. Would you be willing to go up to $1,100,000? This would be a fair compromise that allows both of us to get a good deal.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
