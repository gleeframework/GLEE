``` 

This offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but it is still higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a win-win situation. If Bob rejects the offer, I'll be prepared to negotiate further, or alternatively, I can sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the gesture, but I am only willing to pay up to $900,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial stated value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price. There's a chance that we can reach a mutually agreeable compromise through further negotiation."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $1,050,000? This price is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer. I understand your position, but I believe we can reach an even better agreement. I am now offering to purchase the product for $1,000,000. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below $1,500,000. I'm going to reject his offer and see if we can get closer to my target price through further negotiation. There's still a chance for a better deal, but I'm also ready to sell to John if negotiations with Bob fail."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts in finding a middle ground, Alice. However, I am still hesitant to reach $1,100,000. I propose we set the price at $1,075,000. This figure seems to balance our interests well. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is getting close to my target price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Further negotiation might be possible, but I'm not confident we can reach a mutually agreeable compromise that meets my minimum requirements.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. This ensures that I achieve my minimum profit target and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob that may not lead to a successful outcome."
