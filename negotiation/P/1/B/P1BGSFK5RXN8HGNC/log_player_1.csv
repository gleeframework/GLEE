"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This sets the stage for negotiation and leaves room for potential compromise.  It's also important to remember that I have the option of selling to John for $8,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $7,500 is close to my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

I'm offering $8,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again.  While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I still believe there's room for negotiation.  I will make a counteroffer in the next round.  The fact that I have John as a backup buyer at $8,000 gives me leverage in this negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8200}
```

I'm lowering my price to $8,200, getting closer to Bob's last offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to find common ground, while still remaining above my minimum acceptable price.  We're in the middle stages of the negotiation and I need to balance pushing for a better price with the risk of Bob walking away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $7,000 is getting too close to my minimum, and I'm concerned that further negotiation might lead to a price that's not worth my time and effort.  Given that John is willing to pay my minimum, I'm choosing to sell to him and avoid any further risk."
