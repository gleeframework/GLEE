"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure I can go any higher.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the value this product brings is substantial. I could consider coming down to $1,300,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any higher.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
