"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $1,200,000 to me, and buying it from Alice for $1,500,000 would be a loss of $300,000. I'll look for a better deal.
