"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can see that you're interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $180, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $180 is still a bit steep for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $160. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I need to stay within my budget.",160.0,Bob,4,,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I can offer it to you for $170. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",170.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $170 and my previous offer of $160. How about we meet at $165? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",165.0,Bob,6,,

"I appreciate your creative suggestion, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between $170 and $165, just like you suggested. However, I'm thinking more along the lines of $168, which is closer to my original target price. I'm confident that this is still a fair price for the product, considering its value. What do you think?",168.0,Alice,7,,
