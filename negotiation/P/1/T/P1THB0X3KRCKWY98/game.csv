"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not meet at a price that works for both of us, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $82. I think this is as low as I can go while still making a fair profit.",82.0,Alice,7,

"I'm not willing to go any lower than $82, Bob. I've already made several concessions to try to meet you at a price that works for both of us. I'm starting to think that we might not be able to come to an agreement. I'd like to propose one final offer: $81.50. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",81.5,Alice,9,
