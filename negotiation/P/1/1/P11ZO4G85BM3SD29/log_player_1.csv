{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer gives me a good profit while still being potentially attractive to Bob, who values the product at $1,500,000.  It leaves room for negotiation, but also ensures I don't go too low and lose out on potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the consideration. However, I would like to propose a price of $1,350,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below my desired price. I believe I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to my asking price. Let's meet in the middle at $1,400,000. This price reflects the value of the product to both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Considering the value of the product to me, I am willing to negotiate further. My counteroffer is $1,375,000. I hope this brings us closer to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,375,000 is getting closer to my desired price range. Accepting this offer means I'll earn a decent profit and avoid the risk of further negotiation that might lead to a lower price or even a rejection from Bob.  It's also a significant improvement over selling to John for $1,200,000."
