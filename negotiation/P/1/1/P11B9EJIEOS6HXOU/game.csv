"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for my budget. I'm very interested in the product but I can only offer $1000000 at this time.  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price around $1400000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1400000 is still too high for me. I'm happy to pay $1200000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product. Let's try to find a middle ground here.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1250000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price around $1280000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1280000.0,Alice,7,
