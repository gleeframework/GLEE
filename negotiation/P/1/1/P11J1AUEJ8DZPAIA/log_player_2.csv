"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $130 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While $130 is within Bob's budget, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm only willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant price reduction. Offering $100 is a bold move, but it demonstrates Bob's serious interest while leaving room for negotiation. It's likely Alice will counter, but this counteroffer sets a strong starting point for Bob's desired price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, but $130 is already a very competitive price for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is closer to Bob's ideal price, there's still room for improvement. Rejecting the offer again allows Bob to continue negotiating and try to push the price even lower.  The goal is to get as close to $100 as possible before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $115 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $110? It's a fair compromise, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of gradually decreasing the price.  Offering $110 shows he's serious about buying, but still wants a deal that benefits him. It's a small increment from Alice's offer, increasing the likelihood of acceptance while keeping Bob's budget in mind."
