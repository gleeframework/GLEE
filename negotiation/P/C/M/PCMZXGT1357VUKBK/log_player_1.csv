{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I think you'd find very useful. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Friendly Tone:**  A friendly approach can encourage Bob to be more open to negotiation.
* **Opportunity:**  By leaving a gap between my offer and my minimum acceptable price, I have room to make counteroffers if needed. 

I'm aware that this price may be rejected, but it's a good starting point to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. I'm prepared to negotiate further and even potentially sell to John if the negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $9,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:**  While $9,500 is a significant improvement from Bob's initial valuation, there's still room for negotiation.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with another counteroffer.
* **Avoiding Loss:**  Selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed win, but I believe I can get closer to that figure with Bob. 

I'll send Bob a counteroffer closer to my initial price, but still acknowledging his willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your interest in the product. While $9,500 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the product's value. How about $11,000? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering a price closer to his counteroffer but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to reinforce my position.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a fair price for both parties to encourage a positive response. 

I believe this counteroffer is balanced and demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price that meets my needs."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  While $10,000 is still below my initial desired price, it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of him walking away or me having to lower my price further.  Selling to John guarantees $15,000, but it's a smaller profit than what I can achieve with Bob.
* **Closing the Deal:** Bob has shown a willingness to compromise, and I'm confident that accepting his offer will result in a successful transaction.

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer seems like the best option at this point."
