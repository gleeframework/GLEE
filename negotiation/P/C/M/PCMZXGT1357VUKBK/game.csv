"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $9,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your interest in the product. While $9,500 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the product's value. How about $11,000? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can close this deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
