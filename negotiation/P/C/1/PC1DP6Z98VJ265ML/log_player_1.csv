"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $150 to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is better than $100 from John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price of $130 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $110 is a good offer, I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about $120? That would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet in the middle at $115? That way, I can get a good deal and you can still make a profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $115 is getting close to my desired price of $130. We've already had a few rounds of negotiation and it's important to close the deal before the 10 rounds are up. Selling to John for $100 would be less profitable.  I'm happy to accept Bob's offer."
