Round 2

Round 4

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the effort to find a middle ground, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $16,500 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Bob's offer of $16,500 is a reasonable compromise. It's above your minimum acceptable price and continuing negotiations might not yield a significantly better outcome.  It's better to secure a deal now rather than risk getting stuck with a lower offer or having to settle for John's $15,000."
