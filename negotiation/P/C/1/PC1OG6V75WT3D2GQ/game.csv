"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to the value I'm looking for. Let's see if we can close this deal. ",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $10,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $9,500.  Would that be feasible?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price. While I'm willing to be flexible, $9,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
