"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're really close to your limit, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. Would you consider $10,400? It's the last offer I can make, and I think it's still a great value for the product.

You have three options:

``` 

At this point, Alice has come down significantly and is only $400 above your ideal price. It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and continuing to negotiate might irritate her. Accepting the $10,400 offer is a good compromise to ensure you get the product at a reasonable discount."
