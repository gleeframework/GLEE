"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm offering it to you for $160. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting offer is far too high. It's important to negotiate a much lower price.  We have plenty of rounds to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $60 for the product."",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're aiming to get the price as close to $80 as possible. Starting with a significantly lower counter-offer gives us room to negotiate upwards.
* **Leaving Room:** Alice's product is worth $120 to her, so there's a chance she might be willing to go much lower than her initial offer. 
* **Time is on our side:** We have several rounds left, so there's no need to rush into an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $60 is too low for me.  I could meet you halfway at $110. This offer stands even considering I have another buyer interested at a higher price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:**  While Alice came down in price, $110 is still significantly higher than both our target price and the price John is offering.
* **Pressure Tactic:** Alice mentioning another buyer is likely a negotiation tactic to try and pressure us into accepting a higher price.
* **Room for Negotiation:** We're only on round 3, and our last offer seemed to make Alice move considerably.  There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand you have other potential buyers, but $110 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we meet closer to the middle at $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct Approach:** We're now aiming for our ideal price of $80.  This is the most we're willing to pay.
* **Justification:** By stating our price outright and explaining it's the most we're comfortable with, we're hoping Alice will see it as a firm offer. 
* **Alternative in Mind:** We're always aware that we have the option to go with John's offer of $80, so we're not afraid to walk away if Alice doesn't agree."
