"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its features and market value, I believe a starting price of $20,000 is fair. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  Thank you for the offer, but $20,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for this product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. Let's meet somewhere in the middle - how about $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  Let's split the difference and find a mutually agreeable price.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we settle on $14,000? That's a significant compromise on my end.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're making concessions, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer $12,000.  This is the highest I can go,  but I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,6,
