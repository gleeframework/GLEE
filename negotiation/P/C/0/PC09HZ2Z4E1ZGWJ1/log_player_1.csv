"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its features and market value, I believe a starting price of $20,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  Thank you for the offer, but $20,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for this product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum and even my initial asking price.  There's room for negotiation, but I'm not going to settle for less than half my bottom line this early.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. Let's meet somewhere in the middle - how about $16,000?"", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  Let's split the difference and find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're making concessions, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer $12,000.  This is the highest I can go,  but I believe it's a fair price for both of us.
