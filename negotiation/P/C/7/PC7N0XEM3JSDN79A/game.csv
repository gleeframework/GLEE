"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position.  While $1,100,000 is a good starting point, it's still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This is a fair compromise that respects both of our needs.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
