Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $850,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept for the product. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider selling the product to John for $1,000,000.

It seems we've reached an impasse. Alice is firm on $850,000, and while I could push further, the potential savings might not be worth the risk of losing the deal entirely. Accepting her offer secures me the product at a significant discount from John's price."
