"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but  $950,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle around $750,000? ",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $875,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I'm still willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $850,000.

"Alice, you've been very patient and I appreciate that. However,  $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  My final offer is $825,000. If that's not workable, I'll have to consider John's offer.",825000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $850,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept for the product. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider selling the product to John for $1,000,000.",850000.0,Alice,7,
