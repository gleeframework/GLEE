Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping Bob will find the product valuable enough to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$90 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $120. This is still above my minimum acceptable price, but closer to Bob's offer. I hope this will encourage him to come up a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I'd like to get a higher price,  selling to John for $100 is the best option at this point, ensuring I don't lose money."
