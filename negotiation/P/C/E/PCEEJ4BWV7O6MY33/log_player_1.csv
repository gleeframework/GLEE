"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $12,000.  This sets the stage for negotiation and allows room for compromise.  I'm confident I can get a price closer to my minimum of $15,000 through a few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm not ready to settle yet. I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my desired $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500} 
```

I'm adjusting my price slightly downward, but still keeping it above my minimum. I'm aiming for a compromise that will be more appealing to Bob, while still securing a decent profit for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'll make another counteroffer to try and find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm moving closer to Bob's last offer, but still holding out for a price that's closer to my minimum.  I believe this counteroffer will be appealing enough to Bob, but still profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum. While I could continue negotiating, the risk of losing more rounds and not getting my desired price is high.  It's time to secure the guaranteed sale with John for $15,000, which meets my minimum requirement."
