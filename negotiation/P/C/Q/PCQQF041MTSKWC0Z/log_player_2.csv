"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to be discussing the sale of this product with you. I believe it holds immense value for your operations.  Given its potential, I'm offering it to you at $1,450,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's first offer is too close to your maximum budget. There's significant room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. This product is interesting to me, but the price is a little high for my budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,100,000."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting significantly lower than Alice's asking price, we establish our position and leave room for negotiation.
* **Not Too Low:**  While we want to save money, offering a price too low might insult Alice and make her less willing to negotiate. 
* **Gauge Her Response:** This counteroffer will help gauge Alice's flexibility and give us a better understanding of how aggressively we need to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position on the price. However, $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential for your business. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This offer represents a substantial discount and reflects my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Movement:** Alice lowered her price by $100,000, showing she's willing to negotiate.
* **Still Room:**  While her new offer is better, it's still significantly higher than our target price and what we know the product is worth to her.
* **Maintain Pressure:** By rejecting this offer, we keep the pressure on Alice to move closer to a price point we find acceptable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm serious about purchasing this product, but $1,350,000 is still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000?"",
""product_price"": 1225000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Willingness:** We've increased our offer by $125,000, demonstrating that we are also willing to negotiate. 
* **Strategic Middle Ground:** Our offer is exactly halfway between her previous offer ($1,350,000) and our previous counteroffer ($1,100,000). This appears fair and encourages movement from her.
* **Maintaining Pressure:** While closer to a potential deal, we are still a good distance from her known value, giving us room to negotiate further if needed."
