Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I think your starting price is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering its value and potential.

We're still getting a better deal than John's offer. Let's see if we can nudge Bob a bit higher."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're being firm on the price, but I'm not willing to go above $1,650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,675,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value and potential returns.

Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and while we'd ideally want more, $1,675,000 is a good profit above our minimum. It's better to secure the deal now than risk him lowering his offer or us being forced to take John's deal later."
