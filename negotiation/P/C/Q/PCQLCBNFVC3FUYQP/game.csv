"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer the product for $1,000,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to meet my minimum requirements.  Let's work together to finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,000,000. How about $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
