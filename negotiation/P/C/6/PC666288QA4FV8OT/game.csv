"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $10,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a deal for $9,500. This is a good middle ground that still benefits both of us.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  However, $9,500 is still a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit lower than my target price. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer you a deal for $9,250. This is a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",9250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close! I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $9,100.  Do you think we can make a deal at that price?",9100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. I can offer you a deal for $9,300. This is a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",9300.0,Alice,7,
