"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $7,000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500 to make this deal work.  This is still a great value for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $8,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
