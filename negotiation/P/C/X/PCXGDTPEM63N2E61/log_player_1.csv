Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We are still in the early stages of negotiation. While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, we have room to negotiate further and aim for a higher price.  We'll continue to counter-offer strategically."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing your commitment to this deal, and I respect that. To show you I'm flexible, I'll come down to $950,000. This is my final offer."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Constraint:** We are getting closer to the halfway point in the negotiation rounds. Setting a ""final offer"" creates a sense of urgency.
* **Limited Concessions:** We've made smaller concessions this round to signal we are getting closer to our bottom line. 
* **Encouraging Decision:** By stating this is our final offer, we push Bob to either accept a price significantly higher than his initial offer or risk losing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $930,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope you can meet me halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $930,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $930,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob is sticking to his incremental increases, and even after we presented a ""final offer,"" he's not budging significantly. This suggests we might be approaching a stalemate.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000. Continuing with Bob carries the risk of: 
    *  Bob refusing to budge further.
    *  Time pressure forcing us to accept a lower offer in later rounds.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Every round spent negotiating with Bob is a round lost in potentially finding another buyer who might be willing to pay closer to our desired price. 

At this point, the guaranteed profit and minimized risk outweigh the potential for a slightly higher gain from Bob."
