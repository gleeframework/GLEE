,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price still allows you a significant profit margin, and it's a good starting point for further discussion.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not comfortable with the price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $950,000 is a good starting point, but I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price. How about we split the difference and settle on $975,000? This would ensure a fair deal for both of us.",975000.0,Alice,5,
