Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While the product is interesting,  $1,500,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:** Bob is increasing his offer in very small increments. At this rate, it is unlikely he will reach a price that is significantly closer to your minimum acceptable price within the remaining rounds. You have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,200,000, which is a better deal than continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially settling for a much lower price."
