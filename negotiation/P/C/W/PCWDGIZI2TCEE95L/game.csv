"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think your starting price is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to offer $750,000 for the product.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $750,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see a price that reflects its true worth.  Would you consider $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand that you're willing to negotiate, but I still think $1,300,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'd like to offer $1,200,000 for the product.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  $1,200,000 is close, but it's important we reach an agreement that feels fair to both sides.  How about we split the difference -  $1,250,000, and we have a deal?",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're firm on the price, Alice, but I'm not willing to go above $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and my original offer of $750,000. Would you consider $1,025,000 for the product?",1025000.0,Bob,8,
