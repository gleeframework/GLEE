"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the significant value it holds for you.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value I expect to get from the product.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the pricing.  However, the value of this product is undeniable, and $950,000 undervalues its potential.  I'm willing to meet you halfway – how about $1,025,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $975,000? I think this is a fair price considering the value I expect to get from the product.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting close. While $975,000 is tempting, I'm still confident this product will yield significant returns for you.  Let's settle this – how about $1,000,000 even? That's my best and final offer.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $990,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.",990000.0,Bob,6,
