Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value I expect to get from the product.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $990,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000

While I could push for more, accepting $990,000 is a significant profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away.  It's a strong deal, and time is a factor in this negotiation."
