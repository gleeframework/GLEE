$200 is way over your budget. You'll need to negotiate a much lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160

```"

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
