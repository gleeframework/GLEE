"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $120 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $150, which is still a great deal considering the value of this product.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to come down to $150, but I'm still not comfortable paying that much. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $130. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $130?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $130 is still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $140. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I really like the product and I'm willing to pay $130 for it. I'm not willing to go any higher, so I'm hoping we can meet at this price. It's a fair price considering the value of the product and I'm willing to make a decision today. Can you sell it to me for $130?",130.0,Bob,6,
