"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I believe Bob is likely to accept this offer as it is still below his perceived value of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is more than my minimum, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $135.  This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I still believe the product is worth more than Bob's current offer. I'm hoping Bob will accept this counteroffer and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $132 is very close to my desired price and significantly better than selling to John for $120.  I'm willing to accept this offer and close the deal."
