"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm open to negotiations, but I have to say, I'm quite attached to this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget. You know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John. By rejecting this offer, you can either:

* **Negotiate further with Alice:**  She might be willing to come down closer to your price point. 
* **Buy from John:**  You have a guaranteed option at a price you're comfortable with."
