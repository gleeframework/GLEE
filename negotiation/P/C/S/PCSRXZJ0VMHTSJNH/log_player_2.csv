"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $12,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000.  It's in your best interest to reject her offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Alice, your offer of $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer of $8,500, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Let's see if we can meet in the middle! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,000 is closer to your budget than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than your maximum willingness to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate further and potentially reach a compromise closer to your $8,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $9,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects both our needs.  Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to reach a fair price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'll meet you halfway between $9,000 and $11,000, which is $10,000. That's the minimum I'm willing to accept for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer of $10,000 is still above your maximum budget of $8,000.  You've already tried negotiating and are unlikely to get a lower price from Alice. It's time to take the safe option and buy the product from John for $8,000."
