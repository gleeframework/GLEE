"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Even though Alice's offer is below the product's worth to Bob ($1,000,000),  he can still get the product for a lower price from John ($1,000,000). Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer is the best option."
