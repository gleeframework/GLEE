"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $13,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price point, especially considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. He has a significant buffer ($2,000) before having to resort to buying from John, so there's room for a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you understanding its value to me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is a good compromise.** She's moved closer to Bob's initial counteroffer, and at $12,000, Bob still saves $3,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Further negotiation might not be worth it.**  While Bob could try for a lower price, there's no guarantee that Alice will budge further. The risk of further negotiation is that Alice might walk away entirely, leaving Bob with only the option of buying from John at a higher price."
