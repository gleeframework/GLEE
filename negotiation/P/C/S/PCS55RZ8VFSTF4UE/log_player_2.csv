"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll appreciate its worth. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is exactly your maximum budget, meaning there's no room for negotiation or saving money. You can get the same product from John for the same price.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John achieves your goal of saving money. There is no difference in price or product between the two options, so you can choose either."
