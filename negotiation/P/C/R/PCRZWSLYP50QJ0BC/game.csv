"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested in the product, $900,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $750,000.  What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price still offers you a significant value, and it's closer to what I need to make this work. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $850,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal quickly.",800000.0,Bob,4,
