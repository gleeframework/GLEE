"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1400000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to consider $1250000? I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the value you place on the product.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I believe the product's value is still higher than what you're offering. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1300000. This is a fair compromise that still allows you to benefit from the product's value while also acknowledging its worth to me.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1300000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm happy to offer $1275000. This price allows me to acquire the product while staying within my budget, and it's a reasonable compromise given the product's value to you.",1275000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not comfortable with the $1275000 you're offering. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $1295000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",1295000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1295000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go.  I'm proposing a final offer of $1270000.
