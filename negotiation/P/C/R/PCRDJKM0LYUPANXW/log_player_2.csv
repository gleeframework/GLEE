"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1400000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price. There are 9 more rounds, so it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to consider $1,250,000? I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the value you place on the product."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I believe the product's value is still higher than what you're offering. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1300000. This is a fair compromise that still allows you to benefit from the product's value while also acknowledging its worth to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best possible deal.  While $1,300,000 is closer to his ideal price, he's still within his budget and has several rounds left to negotiate.  It's worth trying to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm happy to offer $1,275,000. This price allows me to acquire the product while staying within my budget, and it's a reasonable compromise given the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 1275000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not comfortable with the $1275000 you're offering. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $1295000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. I hope we can come to an agreement at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,295,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,295,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Jhon's price:**  Alice's offer is very close to what Bob could get from John. It's tempting, but not yet the best deal.
* **Still room for negotiation:** Bob has 5 rounds left. It's worth seeing if Alice will budge further.  Even if she doesn't, he can always buy from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,295,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go.  I'm proposing a final offer of $1,270,000. This is a fair price that allows me to secure the product while also respecting your need to make a good deal. I'm confident we can close this transaction at this price."", ""product_price"": 1270000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to make a fair deal, but I'm still not comfortable with the $1270000 you're offering. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1285000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,285,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,285,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting close to John's price:**  Alice's offer is just $85,000 away from what Bob could get from John.  
* **Limited rounds:** Bob has only 3 rounds left. The risk of further negotiation is high.
* **Secure the deal:** Buying from John ensures a deal at a price Bob is comfortable with. There's no guarantee Alice will budge further, and even if she does, the difference is small.  

By buying from John, Bob secures a deal at his target price and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
