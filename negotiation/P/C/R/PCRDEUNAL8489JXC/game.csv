"Hi Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $200 is my starting price, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $170? I believe this product is worth the investment, and I'm sure you'll find great value in it.",170.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $170 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $125.  This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,4,
