"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $200. I believe it will be highly valuable for you."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think we can come to a better agreement. I am willing to pay $150 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is offering the maximum he's willing to pay, which is still below my minimum acceptable price. There's no room for negotiation to reach a mutually beneficial outcome. I can sell the product to John for my desired price, so it makes sense to do that instead of wasting time on further negotiation with Bob."
