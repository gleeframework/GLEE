Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good deal.  If Bob rejects, I'll adjust based on his counteroffer and my assessment of his interest.  I'm also keeping John in mind as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I still believe I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my target price of $18,000.  If he's firm on $14,000, I'll likely accept, but I'm not giving up yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm raising the price a bit from Bob's offer, but staying below my initial asking price.  I'm trying to find a middle ground that both of us can agree on.  If he rejects this offer, I'll seriously consider selling to John to avoid further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is pretty close to my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk further negotiation. I think it's a good deal for both of us and I'll accept it."
