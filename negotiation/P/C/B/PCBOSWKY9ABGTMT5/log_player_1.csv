Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me a good margin above my minimum value, and hopefully will encourage Bob to negotiate. I'm confident in the value of my product, and I'm willing to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. I'm not willing to accept that price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $13,000. This is a compromise, but it's still above my minimum. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair price and we can finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and I'm starting to feel like the negotiation is going nowhere. I'm not willing to go any lower, and I don't want to risk wasting more time.  I'll take John's offer of $12,000, which is more than my minimum value."
