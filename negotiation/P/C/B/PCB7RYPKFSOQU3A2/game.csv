"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $100? That would be a good compromise for both of us.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $92?",92.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $92 is still a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle again at $98. It's only $2 away from your last offer, and closer to my desired price.",98.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm still not convinced that $98 is the best price for me. How about we meet in the middle again at $95?,95.0,Bob,6,
