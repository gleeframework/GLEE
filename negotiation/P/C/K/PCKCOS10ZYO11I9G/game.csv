"Hello Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly beneficial for you, potentially even more so than for me. I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,100,000.  What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, the value of this product is significantly higher than the market average, and  $900,000 doesn't reflect that.  Would you consider $1,050,000?  I'm confident this would be a worthwhile investment for you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I still think $1,050,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market average.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer to a deal that works for both of us. How about we settle at $1,000,000? This recognizes the inherent value of the product while landing at a price point I believe is fair.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,000,000. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but I think that's the highest I can go. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",980000.0,Bob,6,
