Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it holds significant value and could be a great asset to you."",
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, your goal is to see if you can get a higher price from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $14,500 creates a sense of urgency and potential savings for Bob. It's a price that's significantly lower than your guaranteed sale price but still nets you a considerable profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this is your initial offer, it leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle the price down slightly."
