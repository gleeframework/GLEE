Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum of $120 and leaves room for negotiation. I believe this price is attractive to Bob while still giving me a good profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, I am still hoping to get a better price.  I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm offering $135.  This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway, and it's still a good price for me. I believe this is fair and encourages a successful sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $132 is very close to my last counteroffer and is a good deal for me. It's more than what I would get from selling to John, and it's still a decent profit margin. I'll accept his offer and close the deal."
