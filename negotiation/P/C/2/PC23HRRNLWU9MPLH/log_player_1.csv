"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" for Bob, encouraging him to consider it.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This offer leaves room for Bob to counter without making me feel like I need to immediately accept a low price. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  This will give me a sense of Bob's negotiating style and whether he's serious about buying."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** While Bob's initial offer is low, he's clearly interested. There's potential for a counteroffer that gets us closer to a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Time is on my side:**  I have 10 rounds, so I can afford to reject this offer and see if Bob is willing to come up. 
* **Selling to John is an option:**  Knowing that I have a backup buyer at $1,200,000 gives me more leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $900,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000 to make this deal work. It's still a great price for a product worth $1,000,000 to you. Let's find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a firm but reasonable price:** $1,050,000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. It shows flexibility without completely caving in.
* **Highlighting the value for Bob:** Emphasizing the value of the product to Bob reinforces the potential benefit of the deal. 
* **Focus on a win-win:**  The language ""let's find a solution that benefits both of us"" sets a positive tone and encourages further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I'll adjust my strategy for the next round. If he rejects this offer, I'll likely reduce my price a bit further but will still be careful not to drop below my minimum threshold."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below the minimum:** Bob's offer of $950,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **More negotiation room:** I've already moved down from my initial offer, but Bob's offer is still too low. I believe we can negotiate further. 
* **John is a reliable alternative:** I have a backup buyer, John, who is willing to pay my minimum price, which gives me strong negotiating power.
* **Time is on my side:** With 6 rounds remaining, I have time to see if Bob is willing to come up in his offer. 

I will make a counteroffer in the next round, but I will be cautious about dropping my price too much. I want to ensure I can secure a price that's closer to my minimum threshold or choose to sell to John if necessary."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $950,000 is still a bit low for me. Let's try to meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop to $1,000,000. This price reflects the product's value to you and allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This offer represents a significant compromise from my previous offer, while still staying above my minimum.
* **Emphasizing Mutual Benefit:** I'm framing this as a chance to reach a ""mutually beneficial agreement,"" appealing to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Reaffirming Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, reinforcing the potential benefit of the deal.

**Next Steps:**

* **Assessing Bob's Response:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to consider if I'm willing to drop my price further. 
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:**  I'll continue to keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option.
* **Time Management:** With only 5 rounds remaining, I'll need to be more strategic in my negotiations."
