{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price as close to my minimum ($12,000) as possible, but I'm also aware that Bob's value is $10,000. This means we have some wiggle room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $11000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for $10,500 yet. I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $11,000. This is a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
