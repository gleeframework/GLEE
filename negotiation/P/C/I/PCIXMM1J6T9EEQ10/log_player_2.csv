"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It's worthwhile to try negotiating with Alice. Even if the negotiation fails, you have the backup option of buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since my maximum budget is $1,000,000, I'm starting with the lowest possible offer. This establishes a clear baseline and shows Alice I'm serious about getting a good deal.  If she rejects this offer, I'll have more information to work with for my next counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I believe there's still room for negotiation, especially since she rejected my initial offer. I'll continue negotiating with Alice, aiming to get the price even lower. If she's unwilling to budge, I can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, showing a willingness to negotiate.  I'm raising my offer slightly, demonstrating my interest while still staying within my budget. I'm hoping this will incentivize Alice to meet me in the middle. If she rejects again, I'll be prepared to make another counteroffer or move on to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price again, but it's still above my maximum budget.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I will be more aggressive in my counteroffer.  There's a good chance we can reach a deal, but I don't want to settle for a price that's too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but she's still above my ideal price.  I'm raising my offer to $1,150,000, which is a compromise. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but I won't overpay. If she rejects, I'll be prepared to go back and forth a few more times before potentially accepting her offer or moving on to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum budget.  I'm seeing a pattern where Alice is consistently lowering her price but not meeting my counteroffers.  It's possible she's unwilling to go lower, but it's also possible she's trying to get a better deal by waiting me out. I'll continue negotiating with Alice and see if I can get her to agree to a price closer to my budget. If not, I'm still confident that I can get a better deal from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1175000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's last offer is getting closer to my budget, but it's still too high.  I'm raising my offer slightly to $1,175,000, which is a compromise and shows that I'm willing to continue negotiating. I'm hoping that this will be enough to convince Alice to meet me in the middle and agree to a price that works for both of us. If she rejects, I'll be prepared to make one more counteroffer before potentially moving on to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,212,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,212,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is the lowest so far, it's still above my maximum budget.  We've been going back and forth for several rounds, and there's a good chance we'll be stuck in this cycle for a while.  It's not clear if Alice is willing to go lower than $1,212,500.  To avoid risking further time and potential frustration, it's more efficient to buy from John at this point.  I've already established a firm budget, and John is offering the product at a price I'm comfortable with.  It's better to secure the product now rather than continue negotiating with Alice and potentially miss out on a good deal."
