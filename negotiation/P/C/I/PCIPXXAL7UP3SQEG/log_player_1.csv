Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $15,000. It's a unique item that I believe would be highly valuable to you. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since the product's value to Bob is $10,000 and I have a guaranteed buyer at that price, starting high allows room for negotiation.
* **Potential for higher profit:** There's a chance Bob values the product even more than $10,000, and a higher initial offer might lead to a larger profit.
* **Fallback option:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can always sell to John for my minimum acceptable price. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while considering the risk of losing the sale to Bob."
