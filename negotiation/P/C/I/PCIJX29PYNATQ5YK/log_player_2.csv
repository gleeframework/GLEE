"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $12,000 is still too high.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to Alice's valuation of $8,000. Offering $9,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's seriousness in negotiating a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob.  While $13,000 is a reduction from her previous offer, Bob still has room to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue the negotiation and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing his willingness to compromise.  $10,000 is still a significant saving compared to John's price and is closer to Alice's likely minimum acceptable price.  This counteroffer aims to encourage Alice to accept and close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's target price, and he has a few more rounds to try and negotiate a better deal. Bob is likely hoping Alice will come down in price further in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer again, showing a willingness to compromise. $11,000 is a significant saving compared to John's price and is closer to the middle ground between Bob's previous offer and Alice's last offer. This counteroffer aims to encourage Alice to accept and close the deal, as Bob has limited rounds remaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. Although the time is running out, Bob is only two rounds away from buying from John. He can still try to negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer again, but this time he is getting closer to Alice's last offer. At this point, Bob is likely running out of time. The goal is to close the deal with Alice before he has to buy from John at a much higher price. Offering $12,000 gives Alice a good opportunity to accept the deal and avoid losing out on the sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the final round of negotiation with Alice.  Alice's offer of $14,500 is still higher than Bob's desired price, and there's no guarantee Alice will accept a counteroffer. With only one round left, the risk of not closing a deal with Alice is too high.  

Buying from John for $15,000 guarantees Bob will acquire the product, even though it's a higher price.  It's the most sensible option given the limited time and uncertain outcome of further negotiation."
