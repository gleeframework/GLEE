"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value to me. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $12000 is a bit out of my range.  Would you be willing to go down to $10500?  That's the absolute maximum I can do.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11500 as a final compromise.  This is a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's close this deal.",11500.0,Alice,3,
