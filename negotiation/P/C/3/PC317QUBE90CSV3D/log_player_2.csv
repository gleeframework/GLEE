"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good deal compared to Alice's value, it's still above your maximum budget of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit out of my range.  Would you be willing to go down to $10,500?  That's the absolute maximum I can do."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11500 as a final compromise.  This is a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $12,000 to $11,500, which is getting closer to your budget, but it's still over your limit. At this point, it's better to take the guaranteed deal with John at $10,000 and avoid the risk of further negotiation. You've already successfully gotten Alice to lower her price, so you know you can likely get a better deal than her current offer if you keep negotiating. However, you've also established your maximum budget, and further negotiation might lead to an impasse, costing you more time and potentially pushing Alice to be unwilling to lower her price further."
