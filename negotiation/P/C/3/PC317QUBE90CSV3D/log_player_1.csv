Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum ( $15,000) to maximize my potential profit. 
* **Reasonable compromise:** $12,000 is a decent compromise, leaving room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers.
* **Positive framing:**  The message emphasizes the value to Bob and the ""great deal"" aspect to make the offer more appealing. 

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or counter again, always keeping in mind the option to sell to John for $15,000 if no deal is reached."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $12000 is a bit out of my range.  Would you be willing to go down to $10500?  That's the absolute maximum I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $10,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  I believe there's still some room to negotiate a higher price with Bob. 
* **The option of selling to John:**  I have a guaranteed backup with John, who is willing to pay my minimum.  This gives me leverage in the negotiation.

**Next steps:**

* I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range, aiming to find a compromise that is acceptable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500 as a final compromise.  This is a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""great price"" for Bob, creating a sense of urgency to finalize the deal.
* **Finality:**  I'm positioning this as a ""final compromise,"" putting pressure on Bob to accept.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a decent price while keeping the negotiation relatively short.
* If Bob rejects, I'll consider selling to John for $15,000 as the remaining negotiation room is limited and my time is valuable."
