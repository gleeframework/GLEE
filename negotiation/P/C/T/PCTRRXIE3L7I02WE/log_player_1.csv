{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value. This allows room for negotiation while still leaving me a good profit margin. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable value. However, I believe I can still get a better price from him.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price, aiming for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}

I'm reducing my price by $3,000 from my initial offer, hoping to reach a compromise with Bob while still staying above my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer is slightly above my minimum acceptable value.  I'm happy to accept his offer and sell the product. This way, I avoid the risk of further negotiation and potential rejection that could lead me to selling the product to John for a lower price."
