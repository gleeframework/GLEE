Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate. I'll see how Bob reacts to this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for $10,000. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,000. This is still a good price for me, and it's a compromise from my initial offer.  I'm hoping Bob will see that it's a fair deal and accept."
