"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,800,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see how high he's willing to go. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize potential profit:**  A high opening offer leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a profitable sale.
* **Test the waters:** I want to see if Bob is serious about buying the product and what his budget might be.
* **Set the tone:** A strong opening offer establishes that I'm confident in the value of my product. 

**Next Steps:**

I will carefully analyze Bob's response. If he rejects, I'll consider adjusting my offer based on his counteroffer. If he accepts, I'll be happy to close the deal. I'll also keep John's offer of $1,200,000 in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $1,500,000. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation to get closer to my desired price. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for higher profit:**  I'm aiming for a sale closer to my initial $1,800,000 offer.  
* **Testing Bob's limits:** By rejecting, I'm putting pressure on Bob to increase his offer further.

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to round 3 and make a counteroffer to Bob. I'll be aiming for a price somewhere between his offer of $1,500,000 and my initial offer of $1,800,000. I'll need to carefully consider how much I'm willing to compromise while still maximizing my profit.  I'll also keep John's offer of $1,200,000 in mind as a fallback option if the negotiations with Bob fall through."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1650000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering a counteroffer of $1,650,000. This is a compromise between Bob's offer of $1,500,000 and my previous offer of $1,800,000.

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** By offering a price in the middle, I'm showing a willingness to negotiate and potentially find a mutually acceptable price.
* **Still aiming for profit:** This offer still allows me to make a significant profit above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Testing Bob's willingness:**  I want to see if Bob is willing to budge further to reach a deal.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he rejects, I'll need to consider lowering my offer further, but I'll try to stay above $1,500,000 if possible. If he accepts, I'll be happy to close the deal. I'll also continue to keep John's offer of $1,200,000 in mind as a safety net."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $1,400,000. While I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still believe there's room for negotiation, especially considering I've already lowered my price twice.

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for higher profit:**  I'm hoping to get a price closer to my previous counteroffer of $1,650,000. 
* **Testing Bob's limits:**  By rejecting, I'm putting pressure on Bob to increase his offer further. I'm trying to avoid settling for a price that's significantly below my initial expectations.

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to round 5 and make a counteroffer to Bob. I'll aim for a price somewhere between his offer of $1,400,000 and my previous counteroffer of $1,650,000. I'll carefully consider how much I'm willing to compromise while still maximizing my profit. I'll also continue to keep John's offer of $1,200,000 in mind as a fallback option if the negotiations with Bob fall through."

```

**Explanation:**

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $1,350,000.  We are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and I'm still hoping to secure a price closer to my desired range. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for higher profit:** I want to see if I can get Bob to go higher before considering selling to John.
* **Limited rounds:** I'm only a few rounds away from having to sell to John.  However, I don't want to rush into a decision unless I've exhausted all other options.

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to round 7 and make a counteroffer to Bob.  I'll aim for a price somewhere between his offer of $1,350,000 and my previous counteroffer of $1,550,000. I'll also carefully consider John's offer of $1,200,000, especially if this round is unsuccessful."

**Explanation:**

I'm offering a counteroffer of $1,450,000. This is a compromise between Bob's offer of $1,350,000 and my previous offer of $1,550,000.

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm showing a willingness to negotiate and potentially find a mutually acceptable price. 
* **Balancing profit and risk:**  This offer still allows me to make a profit above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but I'm also recognizing the limited number of rounds remaining.
* **Testing Bob's willingness:**  I'm trying to gauge whether Bob is genuinely interested in closing a deal at a higher price. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he rejects, I'll have to make a tough decision.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Rounds:** With only two rounds remaining, the chances of negotiating a better price with Bob are slim.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John ensures I secure my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  I'm taking the guaranteed profit over the risk of potentially ending up with a lower price from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'll close the deal with John, securing the $1,200,000 for the product.  While I might have preferred to sell for a higher price, this decision maximizes my chances of securing a profitable outcome within the limited negotiation rounds."
