"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $90 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to accept $75? ",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $82.50. It's a great compromise that still benefits both of us.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $82.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $78? ",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $78 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I can sell the product to you for $81. It's the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise.",81.0,Alice,5,
