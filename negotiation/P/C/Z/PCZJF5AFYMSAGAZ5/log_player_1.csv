"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? This reflects the true value of the product."",
""product_price"": 1075000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're trying to get a good price for the product, but $1,075,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $1,037,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,037,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,037,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, but we are still significantly above his perceived value of $800,000.  There's room to negotiate further and try to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your position, the product's value remains higher than your current offer.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,060,000. This is a significant price reduction on my end and reflects my desire to close this deal."",
""product_price"": 1060000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,060,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $1,045,000. I'm getting close to my budget, and I'd like to make a deal happen, but I need to stay within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,045,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,045,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is still consistently moving upwards, indicating he's willing to pay more than his initial offer. We're getting closer to a potential deal, but we can still try to push for a slightly higher price before considering accepting or going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. You clearly see the value of this product. To show my commitment to getting this done, I'm willing to accept $1,052,500. This is a firm offer, as I need to consider my other options if we can't agree at this point."",
""product_price"": 1052500
}
```

**Reasoning:** This counter-offer achieves several things:

* **Compromise:** It shows a willingness to move from the previous offer while staying above Bob's latest bid.
* **Firmness:** By stating it's a ""firm offer,"" we signal this is likely our best price, encouraging Bob to accept.
* **Urgency:** Mentioning ""other options"" reminds Bob of John and the potential loss of the deal for him.

This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the likelihood of closing the deal with Bob in the next round or two."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,052,500, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000, and that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet at this price and finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has consistently increased his offer and is now very close to our previous counteroffer.  While we could potentially push for a slightly higher price, the difference is relatively small at this stage.  Accepting his offer of $1,050,000 guarantees a good profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away or further protracted negotiations."
