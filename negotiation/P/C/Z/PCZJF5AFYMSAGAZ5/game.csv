,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? This reflects the true value of the product.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're trying to get a good price for the product, but $1,075,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $1,037,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1037500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your position, the product's value remains higher than your current offer.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,060,000. This is a significant price reduction on my end and reflects my desire to close this deal.",1060000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,060,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $1,045,000. I'm getting close to my budget, and I'd like to make a deal happen, but I need to stay within my means.",1045000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. You clearly see the value of this product. To show my commitment to getting this done, I'm willing to accept $1,052,500. This is a firm offer, as I need to consider my other options if we can't agree at this point.",1052500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,052,500, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000, and that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet at this price and finalize the deal.",1050000.0,Bob,8,
