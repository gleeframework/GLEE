"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your time, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I've done some research and I believe the product's value to me is lower than you think. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is still a good price for you, considering the value you placed on the product, and it's closer to my asking price. What do you say?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,500. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,500 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $15,500. That's a $500 compromise on my end. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $15,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us",14000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're getting close, but $14,000 is still not quite there for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $14,500. This is a fair compromise and a good price for both of us. What do you say?",14500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,500 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle at $14,250. This is my final offer",14250.0,Bob,8,
