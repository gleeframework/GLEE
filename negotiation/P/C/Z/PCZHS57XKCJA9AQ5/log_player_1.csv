"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I've done some research and I believe the product's value to me is lower than you think. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. $12,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I still have 9 rounds to reach a mutually acceptable agreement."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,500. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price

I will reject Bob's offer. While $13,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I am still not satisfied.  I will try to get a better price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,500 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $15,500. That's a $500 compromise on my end.

Round 6

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're getting close, but $14,000 is still not quite there for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $14,500. This is a fair compromise and a good price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,500 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle at $14,250. This is my final offer 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,250.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000.  While I'm close to a deal with Bob, there's not much room left for negotiation, and I only have two rounds left.  I don't want to risk ending up with a price lower than my minimum.  John offers a guaranteed price that meets my minimum, so it's the safer choice."
