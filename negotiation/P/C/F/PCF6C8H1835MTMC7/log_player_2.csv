"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $1,200,000 to you, and we're looking to sell it for $950,000. Let's discuss if this is within your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is tempting, but it's still above what the product is worth to her ($1,000,000).  There's room for negotiation to get a better deal.  I'll reject the offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $950,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000. This would still leave you a substantial profit and allows me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. While I appreciate your budget constraints, I must respectfully decline your offer. I am unable to lower the price below $950,000. However, I'd like to propose an alternative: let's meet in the middle at $900,000. This would still provide a significant profit for us while remaining within your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is better than her original offer, but it's still above what I'm comfortable paying.  I'd like to see if I can get closer to my target price of $850,000 before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $875,000? This would still provide you with a good profit margin and I could secure the product at a price that works for me."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Let's aim for a compromise that benefits both parties. How about we settle on $890,000 for the product? This price would still yield a healthy profit for us and remain within your budget constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $890,000 is very close to my target price of $850,000.  It's still a good deal for me, and I'm confident we won't be able to get a lower price with more rounds of negotiation.  I'm happy to accept this offer and avoid going to John."
