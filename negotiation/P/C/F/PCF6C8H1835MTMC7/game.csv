"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $1,200,000 to you, and we're looking to sell it for $950,000. Let's discuss if this is within your budget.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $950,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000. This would still leave you a substantial profit and allows me to stay within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. While I appreciate your budget constraints, I must respectfully decline your offer. I am unable to lower the price below $950,000. However, I'd like to propose an alternative: let's meet in the middle at $900,000. This would still provide a significant profit for us while remaining within your budget.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $875,000? This would still provide you with a good profit margin and I could secure the product at a price that works for me.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. Let's aim for a compromise that benefits both parties. How about we settle on $890,000 for the product? This price would still yield a healthy profit for us and remain within your budget constraints.",890000.0,Alice,5,
