"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you.  I'm asking for $160 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 160}
``` 
 
 I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know it's worth to me.  This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point. I'm also making it clear that I believe this is a good deal for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $160 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $130 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is above my minimum value of $150, I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price. There are still 8 rounds left, and I'm confident that I can negotiate a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $145.  This is a fair price, considering the product's value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 
 
I'm counteroffering with a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. I'm also emphasizing the product's value to justify my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $145 is still a bit high for me.  How about $135? I'm really interested in this product, and I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $135 is closer to my minimum, I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. I'm still confident that I can get a better price, and I'm not in a rush to sell.  We've got several rounds left, and there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  Let's split the difference - how about $140? This is a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 140} 
```

I'm aiming for a compromise with Bob by offering a price that's right in the middle of our last two offers.  I'm also emphasizing that this is a fair deal that will get us both closer to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $140 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $135.  It's the best I can do, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've been negotiating with Bob for a while now, and it seems like we're hitting a wall. While I could continue negotiating, I'm getting closer to my minimum price, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower offer.  John is offering me my minimum price, and I'm going to take that deal to ensure I get what the product is worth to me."
