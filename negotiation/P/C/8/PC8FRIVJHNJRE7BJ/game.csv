"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm afraid $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I'm offering the product to you for $160. This is the lowest price I can go, and I think it's a fair compromise.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $140? I'm really interested in the product and I think it's worth it to me at that price.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're still interested in the product, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to go down to $155, which is the lowest price I can accept. This is a good compromise, and I think you'll really like the product at this price.",155.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $152.50. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'd love to finalize the deal at this price.",152.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $152.50. I'm willing to go down to $157.50, which is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",157.5,Alice,7,
