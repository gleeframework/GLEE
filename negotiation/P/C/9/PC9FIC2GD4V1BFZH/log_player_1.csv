Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe is of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $20,000. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Starting at $20,000 gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters.  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** A $5,000 difference between my starting price and my minimum allows for back-and-forth without me feeling pressured to sell below my minimum.
* **Showing Confidence:** Offering a high price initially shows that I believe in the product's worth and helps set the tone for the negotiation. 

**Important Note:**  This is just the first step in a negotiation. I'll need to be prepared to adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $15000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $15000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Minimum:**  Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price.  While I could accept it, there's still room for potential negotiation.
* **Room for Counteroffer:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer that is slightly higher than his offer, aiming to secure a price closer to my initial asking price. This shows flexibility while maintaining leverage. 
* **Avoiding Premature Deal:** Accepting immediately risks leaving money on the table, especially if Bob was willing to pay more.

**Next Steps:**  I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than $15,000, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but I'm also mindful of the value of this product.  To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $17,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows you to stay within your budget."", ""product_price"": 17500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Midpoint Compromise:** Offering $17,500 is the midpoint between my initial offer of $20,000 and Bob's offer of $15,000. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still trying to secure a higher price.
* **Justification for Counteroffer:** I emphasize the value of the product and the need for a price that reflects that value. This helps to justify my counteroffer.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  This offer remains above my minimum price of $15,000, ensuring that I don't lose money on the deal. 

**Next Steps:** I'll be closely watching Bob's response to see if he's willing to meet me in the middle or if he's going to counteroffer again."
