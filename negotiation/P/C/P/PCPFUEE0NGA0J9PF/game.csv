"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer but that price is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $60 for the product.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $60 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $90. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway Alice, but $90 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we try $70? That's a fair price for both of us.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $70 is still a bit lower than I'd like, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $85. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been very accommodating and I appreciate that. $85 is very close to what I had in mind. Would you be willing to do $80?  That's my final offer.",80.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $80 is close to what I was hoping for, Bob. However, I've already gone quite low, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you at $82. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us!",82.0,Alice,7,
