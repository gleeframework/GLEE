We're getting close, but we can still try to push Alice a little closer to $80."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you've been very accommodating and I appreciate that. $85 is very close to what I had in mind. Would you be willing to do $80?  That's my final offer."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $80 is close to what I was hoping for, Bob. However, I've already gone quite low, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you at $82. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $82. Accepting this offer saves you $18 compared to her original offer and avoids the risk of her raising the price in future rounds."
