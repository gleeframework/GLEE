"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm only willing to pay $10000 for the product. It's my maximum budget, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to at least get $11000 for it. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows for a reasonable profit margin for me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,
