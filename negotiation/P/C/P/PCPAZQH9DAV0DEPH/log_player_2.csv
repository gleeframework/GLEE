"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above my maximum budget of $800,000. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I believe the value of this product is significantly higher than your current proposal.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This offer reflects a considerable reduction on my initial price and presents a fair deal for both of us.
