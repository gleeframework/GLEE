Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing further."", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me and allows for a profitable transaction for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I believe the value of this product is significantly higher than your current proposal.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This offer reflects a considerable reduction on my initial price and presents a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,150,000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $950,000 for the product. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable offer, it's unlikely he'll reach the $1,000,000 mark I need. John offers a guaranteed sale at my desired price, making it the most logical choice at this stage."
