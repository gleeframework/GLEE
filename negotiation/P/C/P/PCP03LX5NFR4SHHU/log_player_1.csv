I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum price of $8,000, but still leaves room for Bob to make a profit given his valuation of $15,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,500 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my target of $12,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

I'm offering the product for $10,500. This is a compromise from my previous offer of $12,000, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer of $9,500. I'm hoping this will be a more appealing price point for Bob while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum of $8,000 and a significant improvement over John's offer. I'm willing to take this deal rather than risk further negotiation and potentially ending up with a lower price or even selling to John."
