"Hello Bob! I have a fantastic product that I think you'll be very interested in.  It's worth at least $10000 to me, but I'm willing to start the conversation at $15000.  What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $12000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $13500? That's a fair compromise that still leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but $13500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll offer $12750. Can you consider that?",12750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12750 is still a little lower than I'm hoping for. Let's try $13000.  I'm confident this price is fair for both of us and reflects the true value of the product.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still not comfortable with $13000. I'll offer $12800. Can you meet me there?",12800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within a certain budget, but $12800 just doesn't quite cut it for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $12900.  That's a good price point for both of us, and I believe we can close this deal.",12900.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $12900 is still a bit too high for me. I'll offer $12700. Can you consider that?",12700.0,Bob,8,
