"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  $12,000 is still too low, but it's a good sign that he's interested."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $12,750 is closer to my desired price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,750 is still a little lower than I'm hoping for. Let's try $13,000.  I'm confident this price is fair for both of us and reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 13000}

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within a certain budget, but $12,800 just doesn't quite cut it for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $12,900.  That's a good price point for both of us, and I believe we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12900}

I've reached a point where I don't think I can get much more from Bob. It's better to sell to John at $10,000 than to risk getting a lower offer from Bob in the next round."
