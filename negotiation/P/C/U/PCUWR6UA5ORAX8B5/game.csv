"I understand that you're still looking to save some money, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1300000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm offering it to you for $1300000. This is my final offer.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
