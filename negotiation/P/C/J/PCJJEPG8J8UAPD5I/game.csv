"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price of $120. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about we meet in the middle at $90?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair price, but I'm not sure $90 is enough for me. How about we meet somewhere in between at $110? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a good deal too.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Let's try $95. This is a good price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but $95 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $95 and $110, which is $102.50. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",102.5,Alice,5,
