Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You're aiming to save as much as possible.  Since Alice's initial offer is above your target of $800,000, it makes sense to reject it and attempt to negotiate a lower price.  You have 9 more rounds to work with, giving you ample time to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process.  By offering $750,000, you're making a significant move towards your target price of $800,000. This should prompt Alice to consider your offer, as it's a substantial discount from her initial price."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $850,000 is closer to your target price, but still a little higher.  Since you have several rounds remaining, it's still worth trying to negotiate further. There's a chance you can get a better deal if you keep pushing."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```
