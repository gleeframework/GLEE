"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

Since the product is worth $12,000 to you, and John is selling it for that price, it's the best option to buy from John. You'll get the product for the same price as Alice, but you'll be saving the hassle of negotiating."
