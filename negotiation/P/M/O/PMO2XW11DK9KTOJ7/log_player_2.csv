"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a valuable piece, and I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is above your maximum budget. It's worth exploring negotiation to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for this product.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by making a significant drop in price, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate. $900,000 is still a substantial amount, but it allows for room to compromise and hopefully reach a mutually agreeable price within the 10 rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $1,000,000. This would ensure a fair value for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,000,000, which is your maximum budget. While you could continue to negotiate, there's no guarantee you'll get a lower price, and you risk running out of rounds. Accepting this offer allows you to acquire the product for your maximum price and avoids the risk of a deal falling through."
