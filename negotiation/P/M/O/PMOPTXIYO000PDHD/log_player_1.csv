Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am looking for a more reasonable price. How about $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I believe I can negotiate a better deal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand you're looking for a lower price, $1,000,000 simply doesn't work for me.  Let's meet in the middle.  How about $1,250,000?  This price still allows for a profit for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose $1,150,000 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

While $1,150,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to sell below $1,200,000.  I'm going to counteroffer again, but if Bob doesn't come up, I'm going to sell to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to reach an agreement.  My bottom line is $1,200,000.  If you're not willing to go that high, I'm going to have to sell to John.  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
