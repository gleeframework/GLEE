"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it holds significant value for you.

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has potential, but the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While I value your offer, I'm unable to accept $1,000,000 as it falls below my minimum price.  I'm willing to compromise, however, and offer the product for $1,150,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, while also providing a reasonable margin for you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,150,000 is closer, but still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $1,075,000 is still below what I need to make this deal work. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. This is a fair compromise that respects both our positions.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is a fair offer and I see you're negotiating in good faith.  To be honest, my absolute top price is $1,100,000.  If you can do that, we have a deal.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
