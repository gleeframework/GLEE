Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly exceptional."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, so any offer below that is pointless.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  You know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob. This doesn't mean he won't pay more, especially if he perceives:
    * **Scarcity:** You're presenting this as an exclusive opportunity.
    * **High Value:** You're emphasizing the product's ""value and potential.""
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting high allows room for negotiation.  If Bob counters, you can always come down, knowing your minimum is already met by John's offer. 

**Important Note:** This strategy is based on limited information. In a real-world scenario, factors like Bob's personality, your relationship, market conditions, and the product's nature would influence your approach."
