"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can get a better price from Alice first. $90 is a bit too close to our maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $90 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's starting price. This gives us room to negotiate upwards while still staying well below our $100 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $90 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $82. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we can still try to negotiate a better price. $82 is still a bit higher than we'd like to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $75?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

We're inching closer to a price that works for both of us. This offer shows Alice we're willing to negotiate but also sets a firm target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still willing to work with you. I can offer you a slightly better deal than $75. How about $79? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $79. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $79
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This price is a good deal for us, well below our $100 limit and close to Alice's lowest acceptable price. It's unlikely we'll get a significantly better offer from Alice at this point."
