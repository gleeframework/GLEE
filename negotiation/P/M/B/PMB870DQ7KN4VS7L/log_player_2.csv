Alice's offer:

My counteroffer is $12,250 for the product. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for both of us.

Alice is very slowly lowering her price and it's unlikely we'll reach a significantly better deal.  Buying from John at $12,000 is the best option at this point to save time and money."
