"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. My counteroffer is $12,500 for the product. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's a good compromise.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about we settle at $11,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not sure I'm comfortable with $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think I can do better than that. My counteroffer is $12,250 for the product. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for both of us.",12250.0,Alice,5,
