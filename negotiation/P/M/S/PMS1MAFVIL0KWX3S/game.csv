"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price. How about $16,000?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my minimum.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that you need to get a fair price for the product.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? That's a significant price increase on my end.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my price, but $14,000 is still a little too low.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to sell for $14,500.  That's a fair price for both of us.",14500.0,Alice,5,
