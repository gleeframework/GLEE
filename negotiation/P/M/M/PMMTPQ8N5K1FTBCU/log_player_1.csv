Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a good starting point because it's closer to my minimum value ($15,000) than Bob's perceived value ($12,000). I'm hoping to get as close to my target price as possible, but I'm also open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not willing to settle for that. While I could accept and sell to Bob, I'm willing to risk a counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm counteroffering Bob with a price of $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $12,500. I'm hoping this price will be appealing to Bob and we can come to an agreement without needing to go through further rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue negotiating, I'm running the risk of going back and forth with him and potentially losing the opportunity to sell to John at my target price.  I'm going to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
