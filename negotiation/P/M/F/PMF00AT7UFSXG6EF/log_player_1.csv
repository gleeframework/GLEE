Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This price is a good starting point - it's above my minimum value of $120, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter-offer.  If he rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and see if it's worth continuing the negotiation, or if I should cut my losses and sell to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is close to my minimum price and it's likely he won't budge much lower. I'm willing to accept his offer to avoid the risk of further negotiation and potentially ending up with a lower price or even selling to John for $120."
