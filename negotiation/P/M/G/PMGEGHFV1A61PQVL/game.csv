"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a fair price. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something around $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $1,000,000?  This still gives you a great deal, and it's the best I can do.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I think that's a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your compromise, but $950,000 still doesn't meet my needs.  I'm willing to go down to $980,000. This is a very fair price considering the value of the product and my need to cover my costs.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",980000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $980,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $970,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can meet in the middle.",970000.0,Bob,6,
