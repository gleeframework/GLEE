Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing that Bob might counteroffer.  I want to see how much he values the product.  This will help me determine whether I should continue negotiating with him or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial price, and also lower than what John is willing to pay.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm lowering my price from the initial offer, but still keeping it above John's offer. This shows flexibility while also demonstrating that I value the product more than Bob currently does.  I want to see if I can reach a compromise that's closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below what John is willing to pay.  While I would prefer to get more,  selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, which is more than Bob's current offer."
