Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I know it would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially worth seven figures in the right hands. Given its unique nature, I'm initially proposing a price of $925,000. This feels like a fair reflection of its value to both of us. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Starting at $925,000 aims to secure a significant portion of the potential profit. It's much closer to Bob's perceived value than your minimum.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's potential value to Bob (""seven figures"") justifies the high price and focuses on his potential gain. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is collaborative (""fair reflection"", ""What are your thoughts?"") leaving room for Bob to counter-offer without feeling pressured.
* **Safety Net:** If Bob rejects the offer, you still have John as a guaranteed buyer at your minimum acceptable price.

This strategy prioritizes maximizing profit while acknowledging Bob's perspective and leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement."
