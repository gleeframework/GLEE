Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're firm on the price, but I'm still not comfortable going above $8,000. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle. How about $7,900? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Explanation: Bob is stubbornly refusing to budge beyond his initial offer of $8,000. He's even trying to lowball at $7,900.  Continuing negotiations with him is unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome. Accepting John's offer ensures a guaranteed $8,000, which is better than potentially getting stuck with a lower offer from Bob or reaching a stalemate."
