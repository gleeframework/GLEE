"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm happy to pay $110 for the product. What do you think?",110.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $110 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $130?",130.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $130 is still a little too high for me. Let's try $115.  I think this is a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't go as low as $115.  Would you consider $125? That's my final offer.",125.0,Alice,5,
