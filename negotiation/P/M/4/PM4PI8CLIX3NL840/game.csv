"Hi Alice,  $20,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is around $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that? ",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly lower than what I can accept. Let's meet in the middle, how about $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17,000 is still outside my budget.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13,500?  That would be a good compromise for both of us.",13500.0,Bob,4,
