"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this excellent product at a competitive price of $20,000. It's a great deal for the value it provides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $10,000.  It's always best to reject an offer that's too high and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $20,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is around $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that? "", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly lower than what I can accept. Let's meet in the middle, how about $17,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $17,000 is closer to your budget, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a price closer to your target. You can potentially save another $7,000 by rejecting this offer and continuing negotiations."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17,000 is still outside my budget.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13,500?  That would be a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
