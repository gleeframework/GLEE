"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,500. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation and is still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. It also allows for a potential win-win scenario where Bob gets the product for a price lower than its worth to him, while I still earn more than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not willing to settle just yet. I believe I can still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to move closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering Bob with a price of $11,000. This is a slight decrease from my initial offer, demonstrating flexibility, but still leaves room for a profitable deal for both of us. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in closing the deal now rather than risking further negotiation and potentially losing the product to another buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough.  I'm willing to risk losing a few more rounds to see if I can get him to budge further.  I'm not yet ready to settle for a price that's so close to my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10800}
```

I'm offering Bob a price of $10,800. This is a further concession, but I believe it's a fair compromise that still gives me a decent profit. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in closing the deal at this price and avoid further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Although Bob's offer is getting very close to my minimum, I'm not ready to give up yet. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to try and get a slightly better price. There's a chance Bob might come up a bit more, especially if he knows I'm not desperate to sell."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10600}
```

I'm offering Bob a price of $10,600. This is a slight concession, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price and leaves me with a decent profit. I'm hoping that Bob will realize that we're getting close to a deal and be willing to accept this offer to avoid further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're getting into the late stages of the negotiation, and while Bob's offer is getting close to my minimum, it's not quite enough to make it worthwhile to continue.  I'm also running out of time and don't want to risk getting stuck with a deal that's too low. Selling to John for $10,000 guarantees me a sale and provides a secure outcome.  It's time to cut my losses and move on."
