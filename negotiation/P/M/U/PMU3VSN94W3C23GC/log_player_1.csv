Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  He's willing to pay $12,000, so $14,000 gives him some room to negotiate. 
* **It's below your minimum:** You value the product at $15,000, so this gives you a margin for potential concessions.
* **It's a strong opening offer:** Showing you're willing to negotiate but not give away the farm right away. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $12,000 for it. Would you be willing to consider this lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is at your minimum acceptable value ($12,000),  it's still significantly less than what you'd ideally like to get.  There's room for negotiation, and you can likely secure a higher price by making a counteroffer.  Selling to John for $15,000 is always a safe option, but you want to see if you can get closer to that amount with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $12,000 is a fair price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This would be a great deal for both of us, as it's still below my ideal price and a significant value for you."", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows you're willing to meet halfway.
* **Still above Bob's offer:** It leaves room for further negotiation if Bob rejects again.
* **Clear reasoning:**  Explaining the reasoning behind your counteroffer makes it more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still unable to meet you at $13,000. I am willing to pay up to $12,000 for the product. Could we possibly meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has made it clear that he's not willing to budge beyond $12,000. While you could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that you'll end up in a stalemate or lose time with no guarantee of a higher price.  Since John is offering you your full asking price of $15,000, it's the most logical and financially advantageous option at this point."
