Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You'll accept no less than $1,000,000.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob.
* **Your Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000.

**Strategy**

Since you have a guaranteed buyer at your minimum acceptable price, you have leverage. The goal is to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium over his perceived value.  

**Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Initial Offer:** Starting high allows room for negotiation and tests Bob's eagerness.
* **Justify the Price:**  While you won't explicitly mention John, your message implies the product's high demand and value.

**Possible Outcomes**

* **Bob Accepts:** You get a fantastic deal at $1,200,000.
* **Bob Negotiates:** This opens the door for you to gauge his maximum willingness to pay. You can counter-offer, but never go below $1,000,000.
* **Bob Rejects:** No problem! You sell to John at your desired price. 

**Important Note:** This is just one approach. You could start with a slightly lower price if you want to appear more flexible. However, always be prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't meet your minimum requirement."
