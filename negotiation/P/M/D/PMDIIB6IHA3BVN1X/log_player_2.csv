"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'm willing to make a generous offer. I'll sell it to you for $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,000 is a good deal, it's still above Bob's ideal price point.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate the generous starting point. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial price but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Fairness:**  $8,500 is closer to Alice's desired price point of $8,000, but still offers Bob a decent discount. 
* **Setting the stage:** This counteroffer demonstrates Bob's serious interest while also showing his determination to secure a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $8,750. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** Alice's offer of $8,750 is only $750 above Bob's ideal price point of $8,000. 
* **Potential for Loss:** If Bob rejects this offer, it's possible that Alice will counter with a higher price in the next round, or even reject Bob's future counteroffer. There's also the risk that Bob will run out of rounds and be forced to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Minimizing Risk:** Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price without risking a worse outcome."
