"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have something I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. It's worth a significant amount to me, but I'm offering it to you first at a price of $950,000. I think it could benefit your operations greatly, and at this price, it's a steal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

While Alice's offer is lower than her product's value to her, it's still above your maximum budget and more expensive than buying from John."
