{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable, for $140."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $100.
* **John's Offer:** John acts as your safety net, ensuring you'll get at least $100.

By offering the product at $140, you're aiming to capture a significant portion of the value difference ($50) while still making the offer attractive to Bob. There's a good chance Bob will accept this offer as it saves him $10 compared to his perceived value."
