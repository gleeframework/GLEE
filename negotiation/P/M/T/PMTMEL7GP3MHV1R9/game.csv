"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident you'll find this a fair price. Let me know what you think!",13000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your time and effort, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $11,500. How about we split the difference and go with $11,750? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my desired price.",11750.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway, so how about $11,250? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer, $11,250 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to meet you halfway once again, so let's settle on $11,500. This would allow us both to walk away happy with the deal.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one last offer. How about $11,000? I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not comfortable with it.",11000.0,Bob,6,
