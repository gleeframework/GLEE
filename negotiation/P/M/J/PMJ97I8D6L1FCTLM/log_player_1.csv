{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this incredible product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $20,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm signaling that I'm willing to compromise, encouraging Bob to make a counteroffer.
* **Value Proposition:** Mentioning the product's value to Bob helps build interest and justify the price.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his reaction. 
* If he rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and weigh the potential gain against the risk of losing the sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $12,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting this would result in a substantial loss.
* **Opportunity for Negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's interested.  Rejecting it allows me to counteroffer and try to bridge the gap.
* **Potential for Better Price:**  There's a chance that Bob might be willing to pay more if I counter with a more reasonable price.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my desired value, but still leaving room for negotiation. 
* I'll carefully consider the potential outcome of further negotiation against the certainty of selling to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $12,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This reflects the value I know this product holds. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 17000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price closer to Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the price.
* **Open to Final Agreement:** I'm signaling that I'm open to reaching a final agreement, encouraging Bob to consider my offer.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer.
* Depending on his reaction, I'll either adjust my strategy or move forward with selling to John if the negotiation doesn't yield a satisfactory outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $14000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $14,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While it's not my ideal price, there's a chance I could negotiate a slightly higher price in the next round. However, there's also a risk that Bob might walk away.
* **Selling to John is Guaranteed:**  Selling to John for $15,000 is guaranteed, but it's only a $1,000 increase compared to Bob's current offer.

**Decision:**  I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not perfect, it's close to my minimum and avoids the risk of losing a potential sale.  It's also possible I could negotiate a higher price later on."
