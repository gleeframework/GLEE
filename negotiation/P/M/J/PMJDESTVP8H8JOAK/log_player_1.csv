Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $900,000. This is a strong opening offer that reflects the value of the product to me while also leaving some room for negotiation. I believe this price is within Bob's range of interest, as the product is worth $800,000 to him. If Bob rejects the offer, I will analyze his counteroffer and proceed accordingly, potentially accepting his counteroffer or making a new one. If the negotiations become too time-consuming or unproductive, I will not hesitate to sell to John for $800,000 to ensure a guaranteed sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $750,000 is significantly lower than my starting price of $900,000 and my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. While it's tempting to accept his offer, it's not in my best interest to settle for a price that undervalues the product.  

I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round with a counteroffer. I need to find a price that is fair to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm offering $850,000 as my counteroffer. This is a compromise that reflects the value of the product to me, while acknowledging Bob's interest in a lower price. This price is still above my minimum threshold of $800,000. I believe this price is within the range of what Bob might be willing to pay, and it allows for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I would have liked to get more, accepting his offer is the best option in this situation. It guarantees a sale and secures my desired minimum price."
