"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $1,100,000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $1,100,000 is closer to my budget, I'm aiming for something around $900,000. Would you be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the price down, Bob, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $900,000. How about $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
