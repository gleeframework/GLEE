"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  That price is a little high for me.  How about we start the negotiations a bit lower, perhaps around $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, though - how about we discuss a price of $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle, Alice.  While $10,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget.  Could you consider something around $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting closer, Bob! However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you at $8,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to go. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,5,
