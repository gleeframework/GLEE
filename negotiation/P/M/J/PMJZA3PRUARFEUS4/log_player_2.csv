"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $9,500. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 
It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  You're willing to pay up to $10,000, and Alice is willing to sell for $8,000, so there's room for a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $9,000?  It's still a fair price for you, and it would make the deal work for me."", ""product_price"": 9000}
