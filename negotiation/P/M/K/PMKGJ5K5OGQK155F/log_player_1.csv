Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $130 for your product.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is still too low, considering my minimum selling price is $150. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $130 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $140? It's still a great deal for you, and a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 140}

While $135 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price.  I'll counteroffer again, hoping to bridge the gap."
