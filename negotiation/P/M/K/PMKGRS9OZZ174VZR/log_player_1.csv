Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above your minimum of $100, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to pay more. It's also below the $120 value to Bob, so there's incentive for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $105 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 
This counteroffer is a compromise. It's lower than my initial offer but higher than Bob's offer, showing flexibility and willingness to meet in the middle."
