You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $115 is within your budget, it's still more than you'd like to pay. You can likely get a better price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You're starting with a counteroffer of $105. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still above her minimum price of $100. This strategy aims to create a starting point for negotiation and potentially land a price closer to your desired range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $110 is still higher than your ideal price, but it's getting closer to your maximum budget of $120.  Since you can buy from John for $120, accepting this offer means you save $10. It's a good compromise in this situation."
