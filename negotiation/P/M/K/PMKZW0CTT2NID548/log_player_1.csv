{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm aiming for the full $150, as it's the minimum I'm willing to accept.  However, I'm aware that Bob values the product at $80, so I'll be prepared to negotiate if he rejects my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm confident I can get closer to my target price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $135.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm trying to find a middle ground between my minimum price and Bob's offer. $135 is a good compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will see the value in accepting this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $135 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $110 for it. I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $110 is too far below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to go that low.  It's better to sell the product to John for $150 and guarantee a reasonable profit."
