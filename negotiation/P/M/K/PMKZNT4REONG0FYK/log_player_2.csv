"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something really valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $60. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $60
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  I'll try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  That product looks great, but $60 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $40?"",
""product_price"": 40
}
```

I'm starting with a low counteroffer to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate. This leaves me room to increase my offer in later rounds if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $60 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $40. How about we meet in the middle at $50? It's a great deal for both of us! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $50
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price, but I think there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject her offer and propose something slightly higher than my last counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $50 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $45.  Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 45
}
``` 

I'm inching closer to her price, but I'm still aiming for a significant discount. This strategy balances my desire for a good deal with the risk of Alice walking away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $45. How about we try $52? It's still a great price for the product, and I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $52. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $52
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is negotiating in small increments now. While I might be able to get the price down a little more, it's getting risky. $52 is a reasonable price, and I'd rather secure the deal now than risk the negotiations falling apart."
