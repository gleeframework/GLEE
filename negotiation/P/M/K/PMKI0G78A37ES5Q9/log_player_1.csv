Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $11,500.  Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** You know Bob values the product at $10,000, giving you a baseline for negotiation.
* **Maximizing Profit:** You want to get as close to $12,000 as possible, but you need to offer Bob an incentive to buy from you instead of you going to your guaranteed sale with John.
* **Finding a Balance:** $11,500 is a strong starting point. It gives Bob a $1,500 gain compared to his perceived value while leaving you with a $500 profit margin over your guaranteed sale. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this is your initial offer, there's always room for Bob to counter-offer, and you can potentially meet somewhere in the middle."
