"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a little steep for me. How about $1,100,000? That feels like a fair starting point.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $1,100,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to negotiate. How about $1,300,000?  This price still leaves room for you to make a profit and is a reasonable starting point for us both.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,300,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you consider $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
