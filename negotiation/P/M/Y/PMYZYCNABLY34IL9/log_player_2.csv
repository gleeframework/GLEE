"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $150 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $135. This is a great deal, so let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still above your maximum price. You know you can get the product for $150 from John, so you're better off rejecting Alice's offer and seeing if she'll come down in price."
