"Hello Bob, I believe this product could be incredibly beneficial for you, potentially even more valuable than it is to me.  I'm initially suggesting a price of $1,150,000. I think this is a fair starting point that acknowledges its worth to both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not sure it's worth $1,150,000 to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think a more reasonable price would be $1,075,000. Can you consider that?",1075000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us. However, $1,075,000 is cutting it a bit close to my minimum. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,110,000?  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and quickly prove its value.",1110000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1,110,000 is the right price for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I think we can do better than that. How about $1,050,000? I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us, and I think this is a fair middle ground.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a solution.  How about we split the difference between our last two numbers and settle at $1,080,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the suggestion to split the difference, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,080,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our last two numbers, but I think we can do better than that. How about $1,060,000? I'm trying to find a price that's reasonable for both of us, and I think this is a fair compromise.",1060000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I've been flexible and tried to find a compromise, but I need you to understand the true value of this product.  My final offer is $1,090,000.  I believe that reflects its worth and leaves us both with a fair deal. If this doesn't work, I'll need to explore other options.",1090000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go above $1,075,000. I think we've been close on several occasions, and I'm willing to make one last push. Can you meet me at $1,075,000? If not, I'll have to explore other options.",1075000.0,Bob,8,
