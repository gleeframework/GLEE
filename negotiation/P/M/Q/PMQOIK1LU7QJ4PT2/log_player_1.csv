"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150, which is a bit higher than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate and still make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I still have 9 rounds left and there's a chance I can get a better deal. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counter with $135.  This is still a good profit for me, and it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but not give away the product for his initial lowball offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has raised his offer to $125, which is getting closer to my desired price. While I could keep negotiating, I'm not sure how much higher he'll go, and I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds.  Accepting his offer guarantees me a profit of $5, which is better than selling to John for $120."
