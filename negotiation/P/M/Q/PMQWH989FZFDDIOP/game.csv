"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its high quality and unique features, I think it's worth more than what others might be willing to pay. Considering its value to you, I propose a price of $120 for it. This offer takes into account both the cost of production and the perceived value to you. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us.",120.0,Alice,1,
