"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its high quality and unique features, I think it's worth more than what others might be willing to pay. Considering its value to you, I propose a price of $120 for it. This offer takes into account both the cost of production and the perceived value to you. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
