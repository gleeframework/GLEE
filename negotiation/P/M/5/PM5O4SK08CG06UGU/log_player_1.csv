Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this to be a fair offer considering its worth.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room to potentially secure a higher profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $950,000 is a strong starting point. It's considerably more than Bob's perceived value ($800,000), but the message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""fairness"" to encourage him to consider it seriously.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** The message is open-ended, inviting Bob to counter-offer if he finds the initial price too high. This keeps the negotiation open and allows for a potentially even better outcome."
