Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,750,000. This is a strong starting point that leaves room for negotiation while still reflecting the value of the product to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I want to see if he's willing to come up further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1650000}
``` 

I'm countering with $1,650,000. This shows Bob I'm willing to be flexible but still value the product highly."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,625,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a good compromise and only $25,000 less than my initial counteroffer.  I'd rather close the deal and secure the profit than risk further negotiation and potentially lose the deal altogether."
