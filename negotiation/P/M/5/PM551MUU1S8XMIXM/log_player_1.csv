Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $95.  I know it's valuable to you and this is a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $100.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Maximizing Profit:** By offering the product at $95, you're aiming for the highest possible price Bob might be willing to pay before finding it more advantageous to reject your offer and risk losing out on the product entirely. 
 
This strategy aims to balance maximizing your profit while ensuring the deal is still attractive enough for Bob to accept."
