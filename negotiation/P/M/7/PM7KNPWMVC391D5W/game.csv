"Hello Alice, thanks for showing me the product. While I agree it looks promising, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you. However, I'm still confident that this product can bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering its worth $10,000 to you, and I think you'll find it's a worthwhile investment.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $9,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,500 is still a bit above your comfort zone, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you.",10000.0,Alice,5,
