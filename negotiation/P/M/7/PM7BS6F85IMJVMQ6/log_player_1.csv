"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate, while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product, and if not, how much he is willing to offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm not willing to sell for that amount. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm counter-offering at $130. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $110 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. However, it's getting closer. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a slightly higher price.  I'm hoping to get as close to $120 as possible without risking losing the deal to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm counter-offering at $115. This is a small increase from Bob's last offer, but it's still within my acceptable range. I'm hoping that this small concession will be enough to get Bob to agree to a deal, especially since I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $105 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  We've been going back and forth for a few rounds, and I'm not sure if we'll be able to reach a mutually agreeable price.  I'm not willing to sell for less than $120, so I'm going to sell the product to John for $120.  This ensures I get my minimum acceptable price and avoids further negotiations."
