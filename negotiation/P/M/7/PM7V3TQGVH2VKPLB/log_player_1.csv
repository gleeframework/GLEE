Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($100) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the value of the product and positions the offer as a good deal.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message invites Bob to respond and potentially make a counteroffer. 
* **Plan B:** I have a guaranteed sale to John at $150, providing a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would you be willing to consider $150 as a potential price for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer Meets Minimum:** Bob's offer of $150 is my minimum acceptable price.
* **No Room for Further Profit:**  There's no incentive to negotiate further with Bob, as I won't get a better price. 
* **Avoid Risk:** Rejecting Bob's offer could lead to a longer negotiation with an uncertain outcome. Accepting his offer guarantees a sale at my minimum acceptable price.
* **Equal to John's Offer:**  Selling to John would yield the same profit, so there's no advantage to delaying the sale."
