"Alice, thank you for your offer.  While I appreciate the opportunity, your initial price is a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product, which is still a good price for both of us. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This reflects the product's true value while still offering you a significant gain.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. I'm confident this is a reasonable compromise that benefits both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
