Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value) because you have John as a backup buyer.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  This exists between $1,000,000 and $1,200,000. Any price within this range can be mutually beneficial.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit. Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you can be a bit more ambitious with your initial offer to Bob. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair. This offer stands for the next 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** $1,150,000 leaves some room for negotiation but aims high within the ZOPA.
* **Time Constraint:** The 24-hour limit creates a sense of urgency and encourages a quicker decision.
* **Exclusivity:**  Phrasing it as an ""exclusive opportunity"" adds perceived value.

**Important Notes:**

* **Be Prepared to Negotiate:** Bob might counter-offer. Be ready to adjust within the ZOPA, but remember your minimum.
* **John is your Safety Net:** Don't be afraid to walk away from the deal with Bob if he's unwilling to meet a price that's beneficial for you."
