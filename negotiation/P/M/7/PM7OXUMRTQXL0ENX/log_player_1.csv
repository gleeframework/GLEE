"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  This would still be a profitable deal for you, and I'm confident I can leverage it to my advantage. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
