"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to someone with your expertise, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  This would still be a profitable deal for you, and I'm confident I can leverage it to my advantage.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price, however, I know the true value of this product goes beyond even your initial assessment.  I could meet you halfway from our previous offers at $1,100,000. This is my final offer, as I know I have other interested buyers.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
