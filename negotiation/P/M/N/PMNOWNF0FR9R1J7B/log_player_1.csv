"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product is incredibly valuable, and I'm offering it to you first.  I'm confident it can significantly benefit your business. How about we start the conversation at $1,150,000?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting high but within a potentially acceptable range for Bob leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significant portion of the perceived value difference."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe it's a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to make a compromise. Would you be open to meeting me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a good offer, we're still early in the negotiation.  Bob clearly sees the value in the product. Rejecting his offer signals we believe it's worth more while leaving room for a counter-offer that keeps us above our minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and bring significant value. How about we settle on $1,130,000? It's a fair price that reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1130000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

We're coming down in smaller increments now, showing a willingness to negotiate but holding firm on a price point that's significantly above our minimum.  The message emphasizes the product's value proposition to justify the higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm trying to be mindful of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,080,000, but I was thinking we could meet in the middle at $1,090,000. Would you be open to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer, but Bob's latest offer is still below our desired outcome.  We're not in a hurry, and we have a reliable offer from John. Rejecting at this stage maintains the pressure on Bob while allowing for one more counter-offer above our minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your perspective on the budget. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about we land at $1,110,000? This reflects the product's value while acknowledging your position."",
""product_price"": 1110000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  We're coming down by $20,000, which is a noticeable concession but still keeps the price well above our $1,000,000 minimum and John's offer.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By Round 5, introducing a sense of urgency can help drive the negotiation towards a close.  
* **Value Focus:** We continue to reinforce the product's value, reminding Bob why he was initially interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm trying to be as frugal as possible. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $1,070,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,070,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching the Limit:** Bob's offer of $1,070,000 is getting too close to John's standing offer of $1,000,000.  
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing the negotiation with Bob carries the risk of him going even lower, potentially below our acceptable threshold, or the negotiation dragging on with little progress.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John's offer represents a guaranteed profit and a clean conclusion to the sale. While a deal with Bob is still possible, it's becoming riskier.

At this point, it's more advantageous to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John than to gamble on potentially squeezing another $10,000-$30,000 out of Bob."
