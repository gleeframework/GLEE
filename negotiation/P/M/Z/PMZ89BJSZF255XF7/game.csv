"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $140 is a bit steep for me. How about $130? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",130.0,Bob,2,,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $145. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",145.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $145 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $135. This would give us both a good deal. What do you think?",135.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,142.0
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I can do $142, but I have to say that's as low as I'm willing to go. Is that something you'd be comfortable with?",142.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I'm really trying to stay within my budget, and $142 is still a bit high. How about we split the difference at $138.50? It's a fair price for both of us.",138.5,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,140.0
"I understand your desire to split the difference, Bob, but I'm still a bit above $138.50 in my valuation. I can meet you halfway at $140, which is the midpoint between our last two offers. Would that work for you?",140.0,Alice,7,,
