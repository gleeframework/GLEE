"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to match this price in the future. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1400000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $1400000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1750000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value of the product. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
