"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a common tactic to leave room for negotiation and potentially maximize my profit.  I'm also considering that I have the option to sell to John for $12,000, so I want to make sure Bob's offer is close to that amount before I consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $11,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my target price. I have 8 more rounds to try and get a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500} 
```

I'm going to try and meet Bob halfway by offering $12,500. This is still a decent profit for me, and it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. If he rejects this offer, I will have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's closer to my target price, I'm still hoping to get a slightly better deal. I've got 6 more rounds to work with and I can still sell to John if things don't work out with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm going to offer Bob my minimum price of $12,000.  At this point, I'm confident that he will accept, as he has already shown a willingness to pay close to this amount.  If he rejects, I will have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  We've reached a point where Bob's counteroffers are getting closer to my minimum price, but not quite there. I've only got 4 more rounds left and I don't want to risk ending up with nothing.  It's better to accept John's offer and ensure a profit."
