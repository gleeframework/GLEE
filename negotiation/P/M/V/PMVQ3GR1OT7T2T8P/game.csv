"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This still gives you a significant benefit, and allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's make this deal happen.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a fair price, but $775,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on my last offer at $825,000. This is a great price for both of us, considering the value of the product.  Let's close this deal.",825000.0,Alice,5,
