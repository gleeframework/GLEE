"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm willing to make a fair deal, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $115. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to get a great product at a good price and me to get a fair return on my investment.  What do you say?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $115 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $105. Can you consider that?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $105 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $110. This is my final offer, and if we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options.  What do you say?",110.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're willing to go down to $110, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to go up to $108, but no higher. Can you meet me there?",108.0,Bob,6,
