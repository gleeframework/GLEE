"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $1,200,000, which is closer to my initial offer. This is the highest I can go, and I believe it's still a good deal for you considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
