Round 5
Alice's offer:

```

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down on her price, she's still significantly above your $80 fallback option with John. It's unlikely she'll come down to a price you find acceptable within the remaining rounds.  You're better off taking the guaranteed deal with John at this point."
