"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested but $95 is a bit high for me. How about $85?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we say $90? I'm flexible, but I really want to make a deal with you.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $90 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $88. This is my final offer.  Let me know what you think.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $88 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $92, but that's as low as I can go. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with it.",92.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $92 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to go to $89, which is a good compromise for both of us.  If you're not willing to go lower, I'll have to consider buying from John.",89.0,Bob,6,
