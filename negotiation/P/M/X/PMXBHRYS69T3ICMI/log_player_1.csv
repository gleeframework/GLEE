"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's a classic negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and might give Bob the impression the product is valued even higher.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""potential"" of the product, I'm subtly reminding Bob of its value and hinting that the price is justified.
* **Open Communication:**  Phrases like ""What are your thoughts?"" encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation process. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's Interest:** His reaction will reveal how eager he is to buy and how much he values the product. 
2. **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  The high starting price allows me to potentially decrease the price in later rounds while still staying above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider reducing the price to $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is quite good, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I believe there's room to negotiate further and potentially get closer to $1,000,000. Selling to John right now would be the safe option, but I'm willing to risk a couple more rounds to see if I can secure a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering. I'm willing to be flexible, but $950,000 is a significant drop.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?  This price reflects the true value of this product."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** I acknowledge Bob's counteroffer and use phrases like ""willing to be flexible"" to demonstrate that I'm open to negotiation.
* **Justified Counter:** I don't want to drastically reduce the price, so I propose a number that's a significant decrease from my initial offer but still well above Bob's. 
* **Reiterate Value:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob about the product's worth to justify the higher price. 
* **Seeking Common Ground:** By suggesting we ""meet in the middle,"" I'm encouraging a collaborative approach to finding a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I understand the value of the product, but I still aim to keep my expenses within my budget. Could we agree on $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly willing to negotiate and has come up to a price point that is very attractive. While I could potentially squeeze a bit more out of the deal, it's getting close to the point where the additional gain might not be worth the risk of losing the sale altogether. Accepting $1,050,000 is a solid win."
