{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  He values it at $1,200,000, so there's room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:** It's still above your minimum of $1,500,000, leaving room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **It's a clear and confident offer:** This sets the tone for a productive negotiation.

I'll be ready to respond to any counteroffers Bob might make, keeping in mind that I can always walk away and sell to John for my minimum price."
