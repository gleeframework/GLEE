It's better to try and negotiate with Alice.  You might be able to get a better price. If not, you can always buy from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! $75 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $85? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.

Alice has come down from $100 to $85, which is a good sign. It's still a bit more than I want to spend, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I'll try to negotiate a lower price with Alice in the next round."
