You can do better than $9,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before going to John."

Alice is still asking more than I'm willing to pay. I'll try one more counteroffer before going to John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go back to $9,000, Bob. I think the product is worth more than that to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $9,500, which is $9,250. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.

Alice's final offer is still too high. It's better to go with John at this point and save myself $2,750."
