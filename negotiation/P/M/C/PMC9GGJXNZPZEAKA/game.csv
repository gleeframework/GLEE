"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,250,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you.",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. However, I think the product is worth less than $2,250,000. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the benefits it will bring me.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your perspective on the value, the price you're suggesting doesn't fully reflect the true potential this product holds for your business. I'm willing to come down slightly to $2,100,000.  I believe this revised price is a fair compromise and a strategic investment for you.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not convinced that $2,100,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the benefits it will bring me.",1950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to accept $2,025,000 for the product. This offer represents a significant investment on your part, but I believe the value you'll gain will far outweigh the cost.",2025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,900,000, but no higher. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the benefits it will bring me.",1900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but your latest offer doesn't reflect the value this product can bring to your company. I'm willing to make one final offer at $1,975,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, but I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. If we can't agree at this price, I'll need to explore other options for selling this product.",1975000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your latest offer, which would be $1,887,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the benefits it will bring me.",1887500.0,Bob,8,
