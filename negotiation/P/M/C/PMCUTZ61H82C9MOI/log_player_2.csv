"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9500. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice.  $9,500 is still a bit higher than Bob's ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer, but $8500 is a bit lower than I'm looking for.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 
The negotiation has stalled, and Alice is only willing to come down by $500. Since Bob's target price is $8000, and he has the option to buy the product from John for $8000, it's in his best interest to just buy the product from John."
