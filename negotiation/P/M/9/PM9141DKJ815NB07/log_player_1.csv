Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $20,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price slightly. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the value, you're subtly reminding Bob why the product is desirable and worth a premium.
* **Alternative Option:** By hinting at other interested buyers (""listing it publicly""), you create a sense of urgency and scarcity, making Bob more likely to act quickly. 

**Important:** While John provides a safety net, aiming for a price higher than $15,000 with Bob is ideal. This strategy balances maximizing profit with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
