"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really appreciate it! I'm offering it to you for $90.  What do you think?",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate you considering me for this product. However, $90 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $75? Let me know what you think.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $82.50?  That seems like a fair compromise, don't you think?",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $82.50 is still a little more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go up to $80, which is my absolute limit. If you're open to that, we can make a deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider my other options.",80.0,Bob,4,
