"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $12,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit high for you, but I also need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with a price of $16,000. I think it's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we split the difference and agree on $14,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal today.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll counter with a price of $15,500. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",15500.0,Alice,5,
