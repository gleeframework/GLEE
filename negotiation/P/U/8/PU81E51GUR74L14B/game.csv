"Hi Alice,  $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know if you're willing to work with me on that.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $100 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $175. This still gives me a fair price while ensuring we both get a good deal. Let me know what you think.",175.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $175 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $150?  I'm ready to buy now if we can agree on that.",150.0,Bob,4,
