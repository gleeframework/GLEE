"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you! I'm asking $200 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Reasonable Offer:** $200 is a reasonable starting point, leaving space for both of us to find a price we're happy with. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm starting the conversation with a positive message to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know if you're willing to work with me on that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $100 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I'm open to negotiation, this offer is too low to accept immediately. 

I'll proceed to the next round to counteroffer and try to find a price we can both agree on. It's still early in the negotiation process, and I believe there's room to find a better compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $100 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $175. This still gives me a fair price while ensuring we both get a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a significant drop from my initial price but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Motivational Message:** I'm emphasizing fairness and a good deal for both of us to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  $175 leaves a little room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $175 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $150?  I'm ready to buy now if we can agree on that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $150 is exactly my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to sell for more, I've already made a significant concession and Bob seems ready to purchase.  Accepting his offer is the best course of action to ensure a quick and successful sale.  Furthermore, selling to John for $150 would give me the same profit, but it risks losing Bob as a potential customer for future products."
