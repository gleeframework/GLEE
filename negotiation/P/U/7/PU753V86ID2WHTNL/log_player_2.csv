{""message"": ""Alice, your product is interesting, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $750,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, $750,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's work together to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $800,000.
*  It's worth trying to negotiate further, as there's still room for compromise. 
*  I'm confident I can get a better price, especially since Alice has already shown flexibility by lowering her initial offer."
