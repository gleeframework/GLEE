"Alice, your product is interesting, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $750,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, $750,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's work together to reach an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $800,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
