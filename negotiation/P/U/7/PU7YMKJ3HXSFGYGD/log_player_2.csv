"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1100000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you is $1500000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but you can likely get a better deal.  You know the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, and I do see its potential. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. Given the product's value to you, I'd like to offer $950,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. Considering the product's value to me is $1200000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new offer of $1025000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also acknowledging your concerns about the price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,025,000 is still a good deal for Bob.  It's significantly lower than John's offer of $1,500,000, and it's within Bob's budget.  While Bob could continue to negotiate, it's likely that further bargaining would only lead to a small decrease in price, potentially risking a breakdown in negotiations.  Therefore, accepting the offer is the most logical decision to secure the product at a good price."
