"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1100000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you is $1500000. Let me know what you think!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, and I do see its potential. However, $1100000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. Given the product's value to you, I'd like to offer $950000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. Considering the product's value to me is $1200000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new offer of $1025000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also acknowledging your concerns about the price. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
