"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your generosity, but I'm looking for something within my budget. I'd like to propose a price of $10,000 for the product. Let me know if we can work towards a mutual agreement.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This product is truly worth it and I'm confident you won't regret it.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I'm still trying to find a balance between your valuation of the product and my budget. I would like to propose a price of $15,000. This is still higher than my initial offer, but I believe it's closer to what you're willing to accept and within my financial limits. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",15000.0,Bob,4,
