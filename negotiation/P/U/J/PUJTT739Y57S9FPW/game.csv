"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a truly exceptional item. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a fair price of $2000000.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2000000 is above my budget. Given the value I place on the product, I'm willing to offer $1700000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1700000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I still believe the product's value is worth more. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. My counteroffer is $1900000.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1900000 is closer to my budget, I'm still unable to go that high. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1700000. It's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close this deal.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm on $1700000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my initial price. My counteroffer is $1850000, which is a significant concession from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value.",1850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $1850000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1775000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.",1775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. My counteroffer is $1825000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and is a reasonable compromise from my initial offer.",1825000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. While I understand your need to reach your target price, $1825000 is still slightly above my budget. Let's compromise once more. I'm offering $1800000, which is a significant step closer to your last offer.  This is my final offer, and I hope we can close this deal.",1800000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get as close to my target price as possible. My counteroffer is $1825000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway on the last concession. I'll offer it to you for $1825000, but I need you to meet me at this price. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1825000.0,Alice,9,
