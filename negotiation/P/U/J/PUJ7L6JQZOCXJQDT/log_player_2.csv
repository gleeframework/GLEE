"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth a lot to me, and I believe it could be incredibly valuable for your business as well. I'm offering it to you at a price of $2000000. This is a competitive price considering the value it brings. Let's discuss this further and see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your budget of $800,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price. You can likely get a much lower price from John, but it's worth exploring if you can make a deal with Alice that fits your budget."

{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is very generous, but unfortunately, it's significantly higher than my budget. I'm very interested in this product, and I believe it could be valuable for my business. However, I can only offer $800,000 for it at this time. This is a serious offer, and I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate. While $800000 is far below what I need to make this worthwhile, I'm willing to come down a bit to see if we can find common ground. I'm proposing a price of $1200000. This still reflects the significant value this product offers, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's continue this conversation and see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,200,000 is still above your budget. While it's a step in the right direction, it's worth trying to negotiate further and see if you can get closer to your desired price. If you're unable to get a price you're comfortable with, you can always purchase from John."
