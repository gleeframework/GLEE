Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $19,000.  I believe it holds significant value and could benefit you greatly."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Aiming for Above Value:** The goal is to maximize profit. Offering it slightly below your minimum ($15,000) doesn't make sense. An offer above Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but potentially within his reach might entice him.
* **Leaving Negotiation Room:**  While the initial offer is high, it leaves room for Bob to negotiate if he's interested. You can always lower the price slightly if needed, knowing your fallback option is selling to John. 

**Important:** This strategy assumes you don't have information about Bob's financial limits or negotiation style beyond the provided information."
