Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $12,000 is well above your minimum price of $8,000, giving you a healthy profit.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** At $12,000, Bob is still getting a good deal, and is likely to be motivated to accept.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you can negotiate down, but you still have a backup offer from John to ensure you won't lose out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than $8,000, I'm not ready to settle for that price yet.  I can still try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair compromise considering the value you place on the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9,800? I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob has shown a willingness to compromise, and $9,800 is a significant improvement over John's offer. It's time to lock in this deal and avoid further risk."
