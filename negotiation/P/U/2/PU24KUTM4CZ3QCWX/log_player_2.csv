Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This feels like a fair compromise.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing your hesitation, and I want to be fair. However,  $7,500 is still quite a way off from what I had in mind.  Let's try $10,000 â€“ it's my final offer, and it reflects a significant discount on its actual worth.
