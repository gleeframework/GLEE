"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $13,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for my budget. Could we possibly do it for $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing your hesitation, and I want to be fair. However,  $7,500 is still quite a way off from what I had in mind.  Let's try $10,000 â€“ it's my final offer, and it reflects a significant discount on its actual worth.",10000.0,Alice,5,
