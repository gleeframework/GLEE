"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and uniqueness.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the unique qualities of this product, $15000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let me know if you're interested in negotiating further.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $15000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to sell it for $8000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12000 is still higher than what I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $9500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12000 is still a bit out of your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12000 and $9500. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10750. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value.",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your flexibility, $10750 is still more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm willing to go up to $10000, which is a significant increase from my last offer.  Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10000 is a significant compromise from your last offer, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value.",11000.0,Alice,7,
