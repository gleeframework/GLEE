Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, allowing for some room for negotiation while still ensuring I get more than my minimum value of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $150 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial offer of $200.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $175. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. I hope this will encourage him to accept and avoid further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer. Although it's only $10 more than my minimum, it's still a better deal than selling to John for $150. This minimizes the risk of further negotiation and potentially ending up with a lower price."
