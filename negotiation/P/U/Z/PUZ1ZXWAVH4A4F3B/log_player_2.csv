"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  However, $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $10,500 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,750.  This gives you a good deal, and allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750

Round 4

{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $10,750 is closer, it's still a bit above my budget.  Would you be willing to meet at $10,250? That would make it possible for me to close the deal."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you. Let's find a compromise.  $10,250 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $10,500? This would be a fair deal for both of us, and allow me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to a price that's a good deal for you ($10,500). It's unlikely you'll get her much lower, and further haggling risks her pulling back or you running out of rounds. This price saves you $1,500 compared to John's offer."
