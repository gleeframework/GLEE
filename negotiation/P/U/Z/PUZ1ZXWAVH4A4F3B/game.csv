"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  However, $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $10,500 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,750.  This gives you a good deal, and allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?",10750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $10,750 is closer, it's still a bit above my budget.  Would you be willing to meet at $10,250? That would make it possible for me to close the deal.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you. Let's find a compromise.  $10,250 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $10,500? This would be a fair deal for both of us, and allow me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
