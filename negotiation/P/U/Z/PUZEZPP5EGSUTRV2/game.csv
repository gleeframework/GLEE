"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in the product, $1,400,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000, which is still a good price for both of us. Let's see if we can work something out.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. I've tried to price this fairly, and while $1,300,000 is tempting, it's a significant gap from what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? It's a win-win, allowing me a fair return and you to acquire a valuable asset.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need a fair return, but $1,350,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably offer. I'm willing to go up to $1,325,000. It's a solid price for both of us, and gets us closer to a deal.  Let's try to find some common ground here.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  This product has a lot of potential, and I want to make sure I'm pricing it appropriately. Would you be willing to consider $1,335,000? It's a small compromise for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1335000.0,Alice,5,
