"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm very interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $11000 for it. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $13000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $13000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to offer $12500, which I believe is a fair price considering our mutual interest in this deal. Let's make this happen.",12500.0,Bob,4,
