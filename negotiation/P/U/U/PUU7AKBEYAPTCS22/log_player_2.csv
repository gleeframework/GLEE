"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this amazing product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

You should accept Alice's offer. While you could get the product for cheaper from John later, you'd still be paying more than you'd like. This offer allows you to buy the product for less than your maximum price and save money compared to buying from John."
