Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot more than that. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that's a good compromise - it's higher than my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation. The message is friendly and focuses on the value of the product.  Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price and I'd rather get $90 than risk further negotiation and potentially ending up with John's $80 offer."
