"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you might be interested. I'm willing to let it go for $130, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate your interest but $60 is too far below what I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to go down to $100. That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair price.  Let me know what you think.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts, but $75 is still quite a bit below what I need to get for this product. I'm willing to go down to $90.  This is a good compromise and a good price for both of us. If you're serious about buying it, let's work with this number. Otherwise, I'll have to move on. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Reason: Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $90.  It's better to secure the product from John at $80 and avoid potentially drawn-out negotiations where the final price might not be much better."
