"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your business. Considering its value and quality, I propose an initial price of $15,000. This includes a comprehensive package designed to meet your specific needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high. It's important to negotiate to get a better price. The goal is to save as much money as possible, and buying from John for $12,000 is always an option if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the comprehensive package you've put together. However, $15,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my needs and the product's value."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, and I'd like to accommodate you while still maintaining a reasonable profit margin for myself. Therefore, I am willing to consider your offer of $11,000. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $12,500 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to my budget, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I can still get the product for a lower price from John, so I'll continue negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $12,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is the maximum I can afford. This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
