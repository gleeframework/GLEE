"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $115. This is a good starting point because it's a bit higher than my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident Bob will be interested, as it's still less than the product is worth to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $110 is closer to my desired price, I think I can still push for a slightly higher price. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round, hoping to find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 112}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $112. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. Hopefully, this shows Bob I'm serious about selling to him but still want a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer again in the next round, aiming for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm counteroffering with $110. This is the middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's last offer.  It shows a willingness to meet halfway and hopefully secures a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. Bob's offers are getting too low for me, and I'm worried I won't be able to get a better price in the remaining rounds. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price of $100, which is better than the risk of getting a lower price from Bob."
