```

**Reasoning:**

We're down to the final round, and while Alice has come down in price, her final offer of $1,525,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,200,000.  It's not worth risking further negotiation, as there's a chance we won't be able to reach an agreement. 

Instead, it's better to secure the product from John for $1,200,000, ensuring I get the best possible price and avoid any further negotiation risks."
