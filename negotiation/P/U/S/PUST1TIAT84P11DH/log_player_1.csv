Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, but it's still a significant markup from my minimum value of $12,000.  I'm confident that I can at least get $12,000 from John if I need to."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $10,000. This is still above my minimum value, and it shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but it's also a significant price difference from Bob's offer.  I'm hoping that this will encourage Bob to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not satisfied. I'll reject his offer and continue to negotiate with the goal of getting closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm offering a price of $9,000. This is a compromise between my last offer and Bob's offer, and I'm hoping that it will be a fair price that we can both agree on.  I'm still willing to negotiate further if necessary, but I'm getting closer to my minimum value."
