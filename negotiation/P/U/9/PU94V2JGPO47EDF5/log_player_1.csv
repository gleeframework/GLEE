{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $120, which is halfway between my minimum value ($80) and Bob's perceived value ($150). This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a decent profit.
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer in a positive and persuasive way, emphasizing the value Bob will get from the product. This increases the chances of him accepting the offer. 

This initial offer is a strategic starting point. I'll be prepared to negotiate further if Bob rejects it, but my goal is to secure a price as close to $150 as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  How about $100? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my desired price.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to secure a price closer to my initial offer.  I believe I can convince him to pay closer to $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  It's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've reduced my price to $110, which is a compromise from my previous offer. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a good price.
* **Message:** I'm reiterating the product's value and suggesting a middle ground to encourage Bob to accept. I'm also highlighting the benefits of the deal for him."
