"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product!  I'm interested, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $7,500. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",7500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle at $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I think $7,200 is the lowest I can go. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",7200.0,Alice,5,
