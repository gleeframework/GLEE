"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love! I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

You can do better than $110. You're willing to pay up to $120, but it's worth trying to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, $110 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $95 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference and settle on $102.50? That feels fair to both of us, right? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $102.50 is within your budget and a good compromise.  You're saving money compared to buying from John, and it's a reasonable price for Alice."
