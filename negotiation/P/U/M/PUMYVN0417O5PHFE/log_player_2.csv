(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer is too high. I know I can get it for less, either from Alice through negotiation or from John for $100."

Round 2

{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70?"",

While Alice is coming down, $85 is still too high. I'll try to negotiate a bit more."

Round 4

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Alice seems firm on her price, and $82 is a reasonable deal. It's better than John's $100 offer."
