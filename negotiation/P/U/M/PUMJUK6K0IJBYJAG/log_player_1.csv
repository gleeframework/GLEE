Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Could you consider meeting me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $9,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and I want to see if I can get closer to that.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference again and go with $10,125? This feels like a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 10125}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,900, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?
