"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Could you consider meeting me halfway?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $10,500?  This price is still fair considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500. How about $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference again and go with $10,125? This feels like a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's close this deal!",10125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,900, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",9900.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm happy we're getting closer. I can go down to $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  It's time to close this deal. ",10000.0,Alice,7,
