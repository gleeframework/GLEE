Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a price of $110. This is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to maximize my profit, but I'm also aware that Bob might be willing to pay a bit more if he really wants the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I consider the product to be worth.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm lowering my price to $100. This is still a good profit for me and  hopefully, it will be a good deal for Bob. I'm hoping that by showing flexibility, I can get Bob to accept my offer and avoid selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low for my liking.  While I could continue negotiating, I don't want to risk him getting even lower with his next offer.  It's better to take the guaranteed $120 from John and end the negotiation."
