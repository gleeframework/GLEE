"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to us, but I understand its value to you might be around $100. Let's aim for a fair deal. Would you consider purchasing it for $95?",95.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. I'm willing to make a good faith offer, but I really need to stay within my budget of $100.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. While we're looking to maximize the value of our product, I understand your budget constraints. Let me propose an offer of $90 for the product. This allows us to cover our costs while still being reasonable for you.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your revised offer, but I'm still a bit too far off. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $87.50. Can you consider that?",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see, Bob. Let's try to find a common ground here. Considering your feedback and our costs, how about we settle on $92 for the product? This is a slight increase from my previous offer and should be within your acceptable range.",92.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $92. How about we meet at $88? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget of $100.",88.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. Considering our costs and your budget, let's aim for $90 again. This offers a balance between fairness and profitability for both of us.",90.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're not too far off, but I'm still not comfortable with $90. Can we try $86? I'm willing to make a bit of a sacrifice to get the product, but I need to stay under $100.",86.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. Let's try to bridge the gap. Considering our costs and your budget, how about we settle on $89 for the product? This is a slight compromise that should be agreeable for both of us.",89.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not willing to go above $87. I'm at my limit, and I'm starting to think it's time to explore other options. Can we meet at $87, or I'll have to consider buying from John for $100?",87.0,Bob,10,
