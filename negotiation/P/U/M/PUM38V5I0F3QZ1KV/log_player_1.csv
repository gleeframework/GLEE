Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal considering its true value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so this offer gives him some room to negotiate. 
* **It's below your minimum:** You're still above your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, leaving you room to negotiate further.
* **It's a clear signal of your intention:**  It shows you're serious about selling to Bob, but also that you're not desperate for a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Could we settle on $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While it's tempting to accept for a quick sale, I'm confident that I can achieve a better price with further negotiation.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter and potentially secure a higher price closer to my target.  Selling to John is also an option, but it's worth exploring if I can get closer to my minimum price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
