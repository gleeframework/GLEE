"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $700,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. I could consider coming down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as I already have a guaranteed buyer at that price.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing we might be approaching an impasse.  While I value your interest, the gap between your offer and my minimum price is quite large.  I'm willing to consider a final counteroffer of $950,000.  This takes into account some of the risk you mentioned, but still reflects the true value of the product. Let me know if this works for you, otherwise, I'll need to explore other options.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're right, we do seem to be narrowing in on a reasonable price. I'm willing to concede a bit further, but $825,000 is still too low for me to accept.  My final offer is $900,000.  This is the absolute lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a very fair deal for you considering the product's value. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has consistently resisted moving closer to Bob's price range. While she's come down in price, her final offer of $900,000 is still significantly higher than John's offer of $800,000.  It's unlikely Alice will go much lower, and continuing the negotiation carries the risk of her walking away altogether.  Buying from John secures the product at the desired price point, saving Bob $100,000."
