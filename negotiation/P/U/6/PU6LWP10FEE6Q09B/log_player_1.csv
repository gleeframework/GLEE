Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is more than fair.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Secure a Significant Gain:** Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, selling for $1,400,000 is a $400,000 profit, significantly more than John's offer.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice has no way of knowing Bob's exact willingness to pay beyond the $1,500,000 valuation."
