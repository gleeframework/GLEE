"Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than what Bob is willing to pay from John. It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible.  By offering $300,000, Bob is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This is a strong starting point for negotiation, pushing Alice to consider a lower price. It's also a reasonable amount given Bob's $1,000,000 maximum budget and the potential to get a better deal with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $400,000. This is still a significant savings compared to buying from John for $1,000,000.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will reject further counteroffers and Bob might be forced to buy from John at a much higher price. Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product for a good price."
