{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $130. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a starting point that balances my goal of maximizing profit with the need to find common ground with Bob.  It's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150), but still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm confident that with a good message and a fair starting price, I can reach a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the recommendation. However, I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, aiming for a price closer to $130."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Considering my budget constraints, could we aim for $105 instead?
