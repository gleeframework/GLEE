"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you the chance to acquire [product name] for a price that I believe is incredibly fair, considering its value to you. I'm sure you've already done your research and understand its worth. I'm confident you'll find this offer advantageous. Let's discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice wants to sell the product for as much profit as possible. Her starting price of $1,200,000 is significantly higher than her valuation of $800,000.
* **Your Leverage:** You know John will sell you the product for $1,500,000. This is your fallback option.
* **Negotiation Tactic:** By rejecting Alice's first offer, you signal that you're not willing to pay that much. It's highly likely she will come back with a lower price to avoid losing the sale entirely. 

**Next Steps:** Wait for Alice to potentially counter-offer with a lower price. You have room to negotiate down towards your $1,500,000 fallback."
