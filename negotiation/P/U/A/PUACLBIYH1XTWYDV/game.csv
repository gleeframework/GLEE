"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. How about we meet in the middle at $8,250? I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial deal.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise.  $8,250 is closer, but I'm still a bit stretched.  How about we settle at $8,000? That's my absolute limit, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,4,
