"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"While I appreciate the offer, $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects the value and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $750,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair price that I think reflects the product's value and our previous discussion.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice. While $825,000 is closer to my initial range, it's still a bit outside of what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering the value and our ongoing discussion. Let's try to close this deal and make it work for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
