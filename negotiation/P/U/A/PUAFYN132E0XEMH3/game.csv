"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $825,000. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $825,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a lower price point. Would you be open to considering $750,000? I believe that's a fair offer.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $750,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm offering the product to you for $800,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset.",800000.0,Alice,5,
