Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your product. However, I am only willing to pay $9500 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. I look forward to your response.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $9,500 is too low.  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,250.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's work together to finalize this!"", ""product_price"": 10250}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I'm still unable to meet at $10250. I would like to propose $10000 as the final price. I hope this helps us reach an agreement.

Bob is now offering my minimum price. It's not ideal, but I can't risk him walking away or waiting for another round of negotiation. I'll accept his offer and sell the product for $10,000."
