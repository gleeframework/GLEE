"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1200000. It's a fantastic opportunity, and I believe its value will only continue to rise. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum price point.  There's no immediate benefit to accepting.  By rejecting, you can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  If you can't get a better price from Alice, you can always fall back to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1000000 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. Let's split the difference. How about $1100000?  It's a fair price considering the product's value and potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price of $1,200,000 to $1,100,000.  This is a significant drop and a good compromise.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject your next counteroffer and you'll be stuck with John's higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer saves you $100,000 compared to John."
