"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $11,000.  What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $11,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $16,000 for this. Let's keep the conversation going.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? That's a significant jump from my initial offer and shows I'm serious about buying.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to drop my price to $15,500. That's a fair price for both of us, and it will allow us to close this deal. Let me know what you think.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I can see you're firm on your price, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  Would you consider $14,000? That's a strong offer, and it would allow us to wrap this up today.",14000.0,Bob,6,
