Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $130. This is a price that is significantly higher than what the product is worth to him, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  I believe this is a good starting point, as it allows for potential compromise and allows me to earn more than what I would get from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to find a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $120. This is a compromise from my previous offer, showing flexibility while still trying to get a good price for the product. I hope Bob will see this as a fair offer and agree to it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm selling the product to John. While Bob's offer of $110 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not enough to make it worthwhile for me to continue negotiating.  John's offer of $150 is a much better deal for me, as it meets my minimum requirement.  It's time to secure a guaranteed sale that meets my financial needs."
