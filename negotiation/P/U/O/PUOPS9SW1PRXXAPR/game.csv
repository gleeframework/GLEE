"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit lower than what I can accept at this time. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which still provides you with a substantial benefit. This represents a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's split the difference and settle on $1,212,500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. If you're not comfortable with this offer, I'm afraid I may have to move on to other potential buyers.",1212500.0,Alice,5,
