```

I'm starting with an offer of $14,000. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum price of $12,000, but leaves room for negotiation and still offers Bob a good deal since the product is worth $15,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's still more than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering $13,500. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his previous offer. I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial asking price, $13,000 is still a good deal for me. It's above my minimum and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
