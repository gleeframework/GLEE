Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm asking for $1,750,000.  Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 1750000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** I know Bob values the product at $1,500,000. This information is incredibly valuable.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,750,000 leaves space for potential negotiation. Bob might try to haggle the price down, and I can always come down a bit while still making a significant profit. 
* **Strong Alternative:** I have a guaranteed buyer (John) willing to pay $1,500,000. This gives me a strong position. I don't *need* to sell to Bob for less than that.

This strategy aims to balance maximizing profit with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
