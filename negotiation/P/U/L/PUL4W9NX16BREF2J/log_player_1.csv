Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (anything less and you're losing money)
* **Bob's Value:** $800,000
* **John's Guaranteed Purchase:** $1,000,000 (your safety net)

**Strategy**

You have a strong position because you have a guaranteed buyer. This allows you to push for a higher price from Bob.  The key is to find a price that's appealing to Bob but still profitable for you.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to other interested parties. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $950,000."",
""product_price"": 950000 
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity:** Highlighting that Bob has a limited-time offer creates a sense of urgency and potential loss if he declines.
* **Value Justification:** While you don't want to reveal John's offer, implying there's high demand and inherent value supports the price. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  Starting at $950,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob counters. You can always go down slightly, but you've set a strong anchor point.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might want to start even higher to give yourself more wiggle room.
* **Relationship:**  If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is important, you could consider a slightly lower price, but never below your minimum.

**Remember:** The worst Bob can do is say no, and you have John as a guaranteed buyer!"
