Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $95. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 95} 

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($100) makes sense. This strategy:

* **Maximizes potential profit:** If Bob accepts immediately, I get the best possible price.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  If Bob counters, there's space to negotiate down while still staying above my minimum price ($80).
* **Establishes a strong position:** It shows I value the product highly, potentially leading Bob to believe it's worth more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $85 is above my minimum, it's still significantly below Bob's stated value ($100) and my initial offer. Rejecting shows I'm firm on a higher price and encourages Bob to negotiate further. I'm willing to risk losing the deal to potentially get closer to $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm holding out for something closer to $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $87.50?"",
""product_price"": 87.50
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show flexibility:**  I'm coming down from my initial offer, demonstrating willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain a strong position:** The counter-offer is still significantly above Bob's offer, showing I'm not desperate to sell at any price.
* **Propose a compromise:**  Suggesting a middle ground ($87.50) encourages Bob to engage constructively and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit short on budget, Alice. I'm willing to pay $85, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can you meet me at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now offered $85 twice and stated he can't go higher.  This suggests his willingness to pay is likely capped at that amount. While I could push for more, there's a real risk of:

* **Stalemate:**  Bob might not budge, leading to a dead end.
* **Losing the deal:** He could walk away entirely, leaving me to sell to John for $80.

Accepting $85 secures a profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of a worse outcome."
