"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. However, I am looking to stay within a budget of $800000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate towards that price?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your interest, $800000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to negotiate further, and I believe we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $950000? This would still be a good deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit.  Let me know your thoughts.",950000.0,Alice,3,
