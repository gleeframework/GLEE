Alice's offer is far above your budget. It's best to try and negotiate with her before resorting to John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but $100 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $140? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:

$140 is still too high.  It's worth trying one more counteroffer before going to John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $140 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really serious about getting this product, but my absolute top price is $120.  If you're willing to meet me there, we have a deal. "", ""product_price"": 120}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go all the way down to $120, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $140 and $120, which is $130. This is my final offer for now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130.

Alice's offer of $130 is still above my budget.  While it's tempting to keep negotiating,  John's offer of $100 is the best deal for me. I'll go with John."
