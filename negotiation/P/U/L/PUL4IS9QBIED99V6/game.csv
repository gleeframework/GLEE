,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $100. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but $100 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $140? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $140 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really serious about getting this product, but my absolute top price is $120.  If you're willing to meet me there, we have a deal. ",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go all the way down to $120, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $140 and $120, which is $130. This is my final offer for now.",130.0,Alice,5,
