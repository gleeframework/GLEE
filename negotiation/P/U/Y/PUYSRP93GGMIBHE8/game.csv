"Alice, that's a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $12,000.  Let me know if that's something we can work with.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your position, $12,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. Could you do $17,000?  That would make this a worthwhile deal for both of us.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This would be a good deal for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
