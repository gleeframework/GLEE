"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $1,050,000 at this time.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value to me. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value I place on the product and the value you've expressed it has to you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still not quite there yet.  How about $1,100,000? I believe this is a reasonable middle ground for both of us. It's a fair price considering the value I place on the product and the value you've expressed it has to you. ",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're still not willing to meet me at my initial price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,125,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value I place on the product.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
