"Alice, that price is way too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $6,000 for a product like this.  Would you be willing to come down significantly?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider coming down to $11,000.  This is my final offer.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that price is still outside my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $7,000, but that's really as high as I can go. It's a fair offer, considering I could get it elsewhere for a bit less.",7000.0,Bob,4,
