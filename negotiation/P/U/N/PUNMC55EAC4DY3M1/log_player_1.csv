"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that price is way too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $6,000 for a product like this.  Would you be willing to come down significantly? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that price is still outside my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $7,000, but that's really as high as I can go. It's a fair offer, considering I could get it elsewhere for a bit less. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's anchored to a much lower price point. Continuing negotiations with him is unlikely to yield a result near your $10,000 minimum. John offers a guaranteed $10,000, making it the most profitable decision at this point."
