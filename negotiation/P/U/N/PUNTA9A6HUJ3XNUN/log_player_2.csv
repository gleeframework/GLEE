"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $90. I think you'll find it's a fantastic deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You're willing to pay up to $100 for the product.
* Alice's offer is $90, which is better than John's offer of $100.
* However, you want to save as much money as possible.
* You can likely negotiate a lower price with Alice since the product is worth less to her than the price she's offering."
