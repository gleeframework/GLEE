{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above my desired price point.  I'm aiming to save as much as possible, so rejecting the offer and starting a counteroffer negotiation is the best strategy for now."

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price slightly, but it's still above my target. I'm going to continue negotiating and see if I can push for a lower price. I'm not desperate to buy right now, so I'm not going to cave and accept an offer I'm not happy with."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're finding our discussions helpful, Bob. Considering your feedback, I'm now proposing a price of $8,800 for the product. This includes a slight discount from my previous offer, along with a complimentary consultation session to ensure you get the most out of the product. I hope this aligns better with your budget while still providing you with excellent value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly in price, and her offer is now only $300 above my target. I'm confident I could continue negotiating, but I'm also aware that I only have 5 rounds left.  It's possible she won't budge further, and I risk ending up paying $10,000 to John.  Accepting this offer is the most financially responsible choice at this stage."
