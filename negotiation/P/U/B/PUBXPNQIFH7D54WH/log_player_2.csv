"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have an amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $120. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good price, it's worth seeing if Alice is willing to go lower. I'm aiming to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $120 is a great starting point, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you be willing to go down to $100? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, Bob. I can see if I can meet you in the middle. How about $110? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit on this sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my counteroffer, and $110 is still a good price within my budget.  I'm happy to accept her offer to avoid further negotiation and secure the product."
