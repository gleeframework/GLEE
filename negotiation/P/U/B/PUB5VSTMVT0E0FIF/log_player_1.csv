Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:** This leaves room for negotiation and ensures you don't accidentally sell the product for less than your minimum.
* **It's lower than the product's worth to Bob:** This gives Bob an incentive to negotiate and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

I've chosen to send a message along with the price to start the negotiation on a friendly and open note."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to pay that price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is above my minimum of $800,000, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $900,000? This would still be a great deal for you, as the product is worth $1,000,000 to you."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $875,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $875,000 is still significantly better than selling to John for $800,000.  It's also likely that further negotiation would lead to a stalemate, and I don't want to risk losing this sale entirely.  I'll accept Bob's offer."
