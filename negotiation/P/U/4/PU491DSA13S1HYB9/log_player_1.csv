"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a high price of $1,200,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a profit.  I'm confident that Bob will counteroffer, allowing us to find a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't accept a price that's significantly below the product's value to me. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm countering with $1,050,000. This is still a good profit for me and closer to Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to compromise. I believe this price is reasonable and will incentivize Bob to close the deal."
