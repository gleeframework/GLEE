,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's find a middle ground here.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit, but $85 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we settle at $70?",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $70 is still not workable for me. Let's compromise at $80. This price allows me to make a reasonable profit, and it's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.",80.0,Alice,5,
