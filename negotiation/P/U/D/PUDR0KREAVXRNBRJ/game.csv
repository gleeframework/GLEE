"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this unique product with you. I believe it has tremendous value and potential. I'm willing to offer it to you for $600000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to me is at least $800000. What are your thoughts?",600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $600000 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to pay $550000 for it. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm not willing to go above $600000.",550000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $550000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $575000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to me is at least $800000. What do you think?",575000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the willingness to meet me halfway, but $575000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $525000 for the product. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",525000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $525000. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $560000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a good deal considering the product's value to me is at least $800000. What do you think?",560000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle, Alice. I'm willing to pay $535000 for the product, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",535000.0,Bob,6,
