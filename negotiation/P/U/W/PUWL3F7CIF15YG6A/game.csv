"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $7,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $7,250. Let me know if this is something you're comfortable with.",7250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price.  $7,250 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable with at the moment. How about we split the difference and I pay $7,125? This feels like a fair compromise to me. ",7125.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your perspective, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $7,300. I'm willing to make another concession, so I'm counteroffering at $7,275. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",7275.0,Alice,5,
