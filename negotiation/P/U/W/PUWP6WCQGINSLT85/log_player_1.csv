{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for more than your $8,000 floor price.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's a strong first offer:** It shows you're confident in the product's value and willing to negotiate.

Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response and your assessment of the situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to buy from you. However, I'm not quite ready to pay that much. How about $8,500? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

While $8,500 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than what you want.  It's important to show Bob you're willing to negotiate but also that you value your product.  You can likely get closer to your desired price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8,500 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  This price is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
