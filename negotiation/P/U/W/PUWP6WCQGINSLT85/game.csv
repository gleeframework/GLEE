"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to buy from you. However, I'm not quite ready to pay that much. How about $8,500? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8,500 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  This price is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price. Let's make this happen!",9000.0,Alice,3,
