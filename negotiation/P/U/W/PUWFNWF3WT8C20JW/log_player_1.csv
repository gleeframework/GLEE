Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $800,000 but leaves room for negotiation. Bob still has a potential profit of $300,000, making it a worthwhile offer for him. This approach balances the potential for maximizing your profit while considering the possibility of Bob rejecting the offer and you needing to accept John's lower offer."
