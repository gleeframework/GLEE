{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price.  $8,000 is a good starting point, but there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

I'm starting with a lower counteroffer of $7,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still within my budget. It shows Alice that I'm serious about getting a good deal, and hopefully, she'll be willing to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice has moved slightly from her previous offer, but it's still higher than my ideal price. I'll reject and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

I'm increasing my offer to $7,500. This is a compromise, showing Alice I'm willing to meet her halfway. Hopefully, she'll see this as a good deal for both of us and accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to my price, but $9,000 is still too high. I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can reach a compromise.  We're running out of rounds, so I need to be strategic."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

I'm increasing my offer to $8,000. This is my final attempt to get a deal with Alice. I'm only $1,000 away from her last offer, and it's the best deal I can afford. If she rejects this offer, I'll have to go with John and pay $10,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high. We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and I don't want to risk a last-minute counteroffer from Alice that could push the price even higher.  I've tried my best to negotiate, but John's offer provides a guaranteed price within my budget."
