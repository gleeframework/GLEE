"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $20,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $20,000 is far above my maximum budget of $8,000. It's definitely worth trying to negotiate a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially save a significant amount of money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, that's a very high price.  I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is way out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $20,000 is closer to the true value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $16,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $16,000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking to my maximum budget of $8,000 and will continue to negotiate.  Rejecting this offer allows me to make another counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $16,000 is still significantly higher than my budget. I'm confident that this product is valuable, but I'm simply not able to go above $8,000. If you're willing to meet me halfway at this price, I'm ready to buy it now."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see that you're serious about this product.  While $16,000 is fair, I'm willing to come down a bit further to $14,000.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is getting closer, but $14,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm going to continue negotiating and see if I can get her down to my desired price. There are still rounds left, and I'm hopeful we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $14,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm prepared to pay $10,000 for this product, which is a significant amount for me.  This is my final offer.  If we can agree on this, we can close the deal right now."", ""product_price"": 10000}
