Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$13,000:** This price is a good starting point because it's a compromise between your minimum value ($15,000) and Bob's perceived value ($10,000). 
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value Bob would get from the product.

This approach allows for potential negotiation, while also ensuring that you're starting with a price that is favorable to you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay up to $12,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is closer to your minimum value, it's still below your desired price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price.  There's a good chance that Bob might be willing to pay a little more than $12,000, especially if he values the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our negotiation, I can't go lower than $12,500.  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to meet my own needs. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$12,500:**  This price is a compromise between your last offer of $13,000 and Bob's counteroffer of $12,000.
* **Message:** The message is still friendly and encourages Bob to continue the negotiation. It also emphasizes the value he would get from the product while still protecting your interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'm willing to increase my offer to $12,200. This is my final offer before I consider purchasing the product from another seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,200 is still significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  At this point, you have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay your full asking price. It's more advantageous to sell to John and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
