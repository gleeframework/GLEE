"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is above Bob's maximum budget.  It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob knows he can get the product for $1,000,000 from John. It's a good starting point to offer Alice the same price and see if she's willing to accept it. This will establish a clear boundary and potentially encourage Alice to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's ideal price and what he can get from John. Bob should continue negotiating to try and reach a price closer to his maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to minimize his cost. He knows he can get the product from John for $1,000,000.  So, he's trying to get a price that is slightly higher than John's but lower than Alice's offer. This is a reasonable middle ground that might tempt Alice to accept, especially as she's already lowered her price once."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's ideal price and what he can get from John. Bob should continue negotiating to try and reach a price closer to his maximum budget.  While there are limited rounds left, he has some room to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1075000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, demonstrating his willingness to compromise.  He's still below Alice's current offer, and he's closer to his ideal price. This counteroffer shows that he's serious about buying but is still trying to get a good deal. The pressure is on Alice to accept, as there are only a few rounds left.  If she rejects, Bob might have to settle with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's ideal price and what he can get from John. Bob has limited rounds left, but he's still trying to get the best deal. Rejecting Alice's offer keeps the negotiations open and allows Bob to make one more counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer again, demonstrating his willingness to compromise. He's only $25,000 away from Alice's offer, showing a genuine effort to close the deal. This might be his final offer, as time is running out. If Alice rejects this, Bob will likely have to settle with John."
