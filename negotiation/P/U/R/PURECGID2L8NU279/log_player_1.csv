Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my value and the market conditions. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I'm confident I can secure a better price, and I have the option to sell to John for my minimum."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value and my opportunity cost. I believe this is a good compromise. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is the maximum I can offer. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the current market conditions. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing this deal by pushing for more.  It's time to close the deal."
