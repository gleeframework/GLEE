"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my value and the market conditions. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value and my opportunity cost. I believe this is a good compromise. Let's make this deal happen.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is the maximum I can offer. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the current market conditions. Let's finalize this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
