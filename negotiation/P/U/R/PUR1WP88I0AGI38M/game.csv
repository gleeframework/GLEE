"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I cannot accept your offer of $1200000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1600000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product is valuable, but I'm still not convinced that $1600000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1300000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get from the product.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle on this price. I'm willing to make one final offer of $1200000. If you're not willing to sell it to me for that price, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options, including buying it from John for $800000.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
