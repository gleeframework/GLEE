{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's value:** This gives me some negotiating room.
* **It's lower than my minimum:**  I'm still making a profit, and it leaves me some space to potentially accept a counteroffer if needed. 
* **It's clear and concise:**  I'm stating my price directly and inviting Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I was hoping to keep my budget around $80. Would you be able to meet me at that price point? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While I'd like to make a sale, accepting Bob's offer would mean I'm losing out on potential profit. I'm going to counter with a price that's closer to my minimum, but still gives Bob room to negotiate."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. I'll try to stay within my budget of $80. How about we aim for $85? I hope you can consider this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $85 is closer to my minimum, I'm still losing a significant amount of potential profit. I'll counter with a price that's closer to my minimum, giving Bob one last chance before I sell to John."
