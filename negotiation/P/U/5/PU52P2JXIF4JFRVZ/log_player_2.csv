"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. I'll try a counteroffer to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $90?"",
 ""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

This counter-offer aims to bring the price down significantly.  It's important to start with a lower offer while still leaving room for further negotiation if Alice rejects it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $110 might be a bit high, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can do $100 for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down on her price, which is a good sign. However, there's still potential for a better deal. I'll reject this offer and propose something slightly lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $95?"",
 ""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

This counter-offer suggests a price halfway between our previous offers.  It shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still willing to work with you! I can do $98 for the product. It's getting close to the minimum I'm willing to accept, but I'm willing to compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $98
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is signaling that this is close to her lowest price. While I could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are minimal at this point. Accepting the $98 offer seems like a reasonable compromise."
