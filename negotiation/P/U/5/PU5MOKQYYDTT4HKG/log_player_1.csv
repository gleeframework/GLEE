Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and represents a significant return on investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Knowing Bob values the product significantly higher than your minimum price gives you leverage. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  The $1,300,000 offer leaves space for Bob to negotiate down, potentially reaching a price that's still highly profitable for you (e.g., $1,200,000+). 
* **Justification:**  Highlighting the ""value and potential"" subtly reminds Bob of his own $1,500,000 valuation.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's negotiating style:** This strategy assumes Bob is open to negotiation. If he's known for being very direct, a slightly lower initial offer might be more effective.
* **Time sensitivity:** If you have a limited timeframe to sell the product, you might adjust your strategy and lower the price slightly to increase the chances of a quick deal."
