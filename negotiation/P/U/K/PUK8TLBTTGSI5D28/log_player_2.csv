{""product_price"": 1000000}

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a very low counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. I'm aiming for a price significantly lower than my maximum budget of $1,500,000, hoping to secure a good deal."

**Reasoning:**  Alice's new offer is still above my maximum budget.  I'll continue to negotiate by making another counteroffer in hopes of getting a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to negotiate. This is still significantly lower than Alice's latest offer, but closer to my maximum budget. I'm hoping Alice will see this as a reasonable compromise."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is now within my budget, and it's only $100,000 higher than what I could get from John.  While I'd prefer to pay less, the risk of continuing to negotiate might result in Alice rejecting my offers and pushing the price even higher. It's a good deal and I'm happy to accept it."
