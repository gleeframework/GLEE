"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 might be a stretch, but I'm still confident in the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
