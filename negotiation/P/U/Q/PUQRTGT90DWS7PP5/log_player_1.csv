Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a price of $750,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round, aiming to get closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be closer to my target price to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This represents a significant investment on your part, and I'm confident it will yield substantial returns. Let's see if we can bridge this gap and reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $825,000. This is my best offer, and I hope it meets somewhere in the middle for us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price, and we're already on round 4.  It's likely we won't be able to squeeze much more out of him, and I don't want to risk losing him completely."
