Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle.

You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob or secure the $800,000 from John if needed."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. While $750,000 is lower than my initial asking price, I understand your perspective. Let's find a middle ground.

I'm open to further discussion if you have other suggestions."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $775,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions. I'm open to further negotiation if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $775,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with selling below $800,000. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to see if we can find a compromise in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $775,000 is unfortunately still below my minimum threshold for this product. To demonstrate my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to drop my price to $825,000. This is a significant concession on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and potential. I'm open to a final counteroffer from you, but we need to close this deal soon to avoid going to John with my guaranteed offer."", ""product_price"": 825000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a final counteroffer of $795,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions. If this offer is not accepted, I will consider purchasing the product from John for $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $795,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  While I'd prefer to close the deal with Bob, it's not worth risking losing a guaranteed $800,000 from John.  I will sell the product to John."
