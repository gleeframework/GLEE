"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product that I believe will be a valuable asset to your business. My initial price is $900,000, reflecting the product's high quality and potential.

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. While $750,000 is lower than my initial asking price, I understand your perspective. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to reduce my price to $850,000, which reflects the product's value while leaving room for both of us to benefit from this deal. I'm open to further discussion if you have other suggestions.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $775,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions. I'm open to further negotiation if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $775,000 is unfortunately still below my minimum threshold for this product. To demonstrate my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to drop my price to $825,000. This is a significant concession on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and potential. I'm open to a final counteroffer from you, but we need to close this deal soon to avoid going to John with my guaranteed offer.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a final counteroffer of $795,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions. If this offer is not accepted, I will consider purchasing the product from John for $800,000.",795000.0,Bob,6,
