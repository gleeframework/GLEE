"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  Let's start with $1,250,000 and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product.  While I'm aiming for a higher price point, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000. This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and I believe it's a fair compromise."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,300,000? It's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob is now willing to pay $1,300,000, which is a reasonable profit above your minimum.  While you could push for more, there's a risk he'll lower his offer or walk away in future rounds. Accepting now secures a good deal."
