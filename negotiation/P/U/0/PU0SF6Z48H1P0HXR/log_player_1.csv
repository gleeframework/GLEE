Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think will be really valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is more than what Bob values the product at, but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message positive and friendly to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  I'm not starting at my absolute bottom line, leaving room to potentially negotiate down if needed.
* **Plan B:**  I have John as a backup, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! That's a bit too pricey for me right now. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $6,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 and even lower than what the product is worth to Bob.
* **Negotiation Opportunity:**  While I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer, I still see an opportunity to negotiate with him. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing I can sell to John for $12,000 gives me leverage in negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's find some common ground!"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's low offer but making a counteroffer to show I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still keeping it above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message positive to encourage further negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, reinforcing the good deal I'm offering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $7,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob has moved closer to my minimum, $7,250 is still below my acceptable price.
* **Potential to get more:**  I believe I can still get a better price with further negotiation. 
* **Safe to reject:**  With John as a buyer, I have the safety net of a higher price if I can't reach an agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7,250 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $7,750?  This is a fair price considering the product's value, and it allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 7750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but making a counteroffer to show I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Split the Difference:** I'm proposing a price that is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's last offer, showing I'm committed to finding a middle ground.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message positive and encouraging Bob to consider the compromise.
* **Value Justification:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to reinforce the fairness of my offer."
