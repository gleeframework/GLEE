Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before anyone else. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $19,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start negotiations with Bob at a higher price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering the product at $19,000 leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob. He might try to negotiate the price down, and you can then decide if you want to accept a lower offer or stick with selling to John.
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's value to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously. 
 
**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** Keep in mind that Bob only values the product at $10,000. Your offer is significantly higher than his perceived value.
* **Negotiation Skills:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer or even reject your initial offer. Your ability to negotiate effectively will influence the final outcome."
