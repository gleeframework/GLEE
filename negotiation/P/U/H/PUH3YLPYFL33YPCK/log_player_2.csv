Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to your price, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $92. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.

Alice is clearly trying to maximize her profit and is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $92 gets you the product at a price significantly lower than John's offer. Holding out for a slightly better deal might backfire."
