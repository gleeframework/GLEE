"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should try to get a better price by rejecting the initial offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,100,000. This product is valuable to me, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This reflects a significant discount from my original offer and is a fair price for both of us. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,200,000, which is still a good deal for Bob.  While Bob could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal to another buyer (John) is significant. At this price, Bob is saving $200,000 compared to John's offer, making it a wise decision to accept."
