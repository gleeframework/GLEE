,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something more in the range of $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be compensated fairly for this product's value.  How about $1,100,000?  That's a significant discount from my initial offer and still leaves you with a great deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I hope we can both agree on. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
