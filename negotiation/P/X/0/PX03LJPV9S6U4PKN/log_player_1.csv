Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's valuation but still leaves room for negotiation. It's also close to my minimum valuation, ensuring I make a profit. If Bob rejects, I can analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $140 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum valuation of $150, so accepting it would result in a loss. I will reject his offer and counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $130 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

This counteroffer is still slightly above Bob's valuation but closer to his offer. This keeps the negotiation moving while still protecting my profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $135 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $132?  It's a fair compromise, and we can both be happy with the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is still below my ideal price, it's close enough to my minimum valuation of $150 and  would allow me to avoid the risk of losing the deal and having to sell to John for the same price."
