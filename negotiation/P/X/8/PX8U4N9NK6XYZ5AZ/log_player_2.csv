"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Buying from Alice:**  You get the product for $110, saving $10 compared to buying from John.
* **Rejecting Alice's offer:** This means you'll buy from John for $120, which is less desirable.

Since your goal is to save money, accepting Alice's offer is the best choice."
