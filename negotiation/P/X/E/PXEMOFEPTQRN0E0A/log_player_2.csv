"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a valuable asset, and I believe it will be a great addition to your business.  My asking price is $1400000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and its potential benefits to you.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is within his budget, it's still above his ideal price. Rejecting the offer allows him to try and negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  While I appreciate your offer, $1200000 is significantly lower than my asking price.  However, I'm willing to compromise. I'm confident this product will generate substantial value for you, and I'm willing to come down to $1300000 to make this deal work.  Let's meet in the middle and make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $1,300,000 is closer to his ideal price, he's still willing to negotiate further. Rejecting the offer allows him to try and get a lower price from Alice before resorting to buying from John."

{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,300,000 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping to reach a deal at $1,250,000.

Let's finalize this deal and make it happen."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. $1250000 is still below my minimum target, but I'm willing to make one final concession.  Let's close this deal at $1350000. This is my last offer, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has been trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice, but it seems like they've reached a stalemate. Alice's final offer of $1,350,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price of $1,200,000. 

Since Bob is willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, it makes more sense for him to buy from John at that price rather than continuing to negotiate with Alice and potentially risk losing the product altogether."
