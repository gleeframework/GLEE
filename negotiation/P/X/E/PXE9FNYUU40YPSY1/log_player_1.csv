Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget I need to stick to. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're getting closer, but $1,050,000 is still less than our minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). We have room to negotiate further and try to get closer to our target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. To be candid, $1,200,000 is the lowest I can go while still making this worthwhile for me.  If you're firm on your budget, I understand, but this is my best offer."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  In this round, we've decided to be transparent with Bob about our absolute bottom line. This does a few things:

* **Shows seriousness:**  It signals that we're serious about making a deal but not willing to go below our limit.
* **Puts the ball in Bob's court:** It forces Bob to decide if he's willing to meet our minimum or risk losing the deal. 
* **Keeps John as a backup:**  We're still open to selling to John for our desired price if Bob rejects this final offer."
