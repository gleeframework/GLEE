Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. To be candid, $1,200,000 is the lowest I can go while still making this worthwhile for me.  If you're firm on your budget, I understand, but this is my best offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear that $1,200,000 is her absolute bottom line. This exceeds your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While you could continue negotiating, it's highly unlikely Alice will come down further, and you risk losing the opportunity to buy from John at your target price."
