"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  I'm proposing a price of $1,600,000. This still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go above $1,500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,550,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from the product and the price John is willing to sell it for.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
