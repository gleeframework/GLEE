Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth at least $12,000, and since you're interested, I'm willing to start the bidding at $14,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a High Anchor:** Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($14,000) sets a high anchor. While he knows it's worth $12,000 to him, this starting point may make him more amenable to a price slightly lower, but still above your minimum.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message implies there's room for negotiation (""willing to start the bidding""). This gives Bob a chance to counter-offer and feel like he's getting a better deal.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 with John. This allows you to be more assertive in your initial offer to Bob.

**Important:** It's crucial to gauge Bob's reaction and be prepared to negotiate. If he seems hesitant or completely put off by the initial price, be ready to adjust your approach and potentially lower the price slightly to secure the sale."
