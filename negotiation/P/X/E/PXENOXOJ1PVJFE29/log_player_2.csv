"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to start with an offer of $12000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to find a price that's closer to my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob, but I'm not quite willing to go as low as $10000. I can meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $11,500.** This is still a good deal for Bob compared to buying from John for $15,000. 
* **Bob's goal is to save money, but also acquire the product.**  Accepting this offer achieves both. 
* **While further negotiation could potentially result in a lower price, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price.** 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice to save money and secure the product."
