"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I still think this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",115.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting stuck in a loop here. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I think $110 is still a bit low. I'm willing to meet you at $112. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",112.0,Alice,5,
