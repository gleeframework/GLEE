"I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95? It's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $85?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $85 is simply too low for me.  Let's compromise one last time.  How about we settle at $90? This way, we both get a good deal.",90.0,Alice,5,
