Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth at least $8,000 to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. I believe I can negotiate a better price with him or, if necessary, sell the product to John for a much higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get closer to $11,000.  Let's split the difference and settle on $10,500.  This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth $8,000 to you."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Can we meet in the middle at $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not ready to sell. I'm going to counteroffer again, trying to push Bob a little closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,250. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit short on budget, and $10,250 is pushing it. I'd be willing to go up to $9,750, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm tempted to accept Bob's offer, it's still a bit too far from my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of him. If that fails, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,750 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers, and settle on $10,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can do.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go back to $10,000. I'm still at $9,750, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to explore other options 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached my limit with Bob.  He's clearly not willing to budge any further, and I'm running out of time.  It's better to sell to John for $15,000 than to risk getting nothing at all from Bob."
