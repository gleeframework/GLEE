"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm offering it to you at a price that's fair to both of us.  Let's discuss a price that works for both of us.  I'm confident we can find a win-win solution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly open to negotiation and emphasizing a ""win-win."" This suggests she might be willing to go lower. 
* While $13,000 is less than your $15,000 maximum, there's room to potentially save more by rejecting and seeing if Alice will counter with a better offer."
