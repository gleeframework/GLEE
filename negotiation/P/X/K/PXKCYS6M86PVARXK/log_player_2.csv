"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you might be interested in. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and what John offers. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $80 for it."",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it leaves you room to negotiate upwards while staying well below your $100 limit and John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! $80 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $120.  This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but $120 is still above your ideal price and what John offers. There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $100? That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

This counter-offer does a few things:

* **Compromise:** It shows Alice you're willing to negotiate by moving closer to her price.
* **Firmness:**  The ""final offer"" language signals you're unlikely to go higher.
* **Matches John:** It puts you at the same price as your alternative, putting a bit of pressure on Alice."
