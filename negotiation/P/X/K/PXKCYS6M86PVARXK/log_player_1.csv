{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you might be interested in. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than what I can get from John. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $80 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $80 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than what I can get from John.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! $80 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $120.  This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $100? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is exactly what the product is worth to him, and it's better than my minimum of $150. While I would prefer to get more, it's a good deal for me and I can move on to other opportunities."
