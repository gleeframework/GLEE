# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:

I'm willing to meet you halfway at $750,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $750,000 is still significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  He's also indicated it's his final offer.  Continuing negotiations is unlikely to result in a price you find acceptable. 

You have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000, which meets your minimum. It's the best decision for you to maximize your profit and avoid further negotiation."
