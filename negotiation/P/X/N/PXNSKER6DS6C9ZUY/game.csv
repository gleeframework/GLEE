"Hello Alice, thank you for offering this product. While I agree it's valuable, the price point of $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm prepared to offer $500,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product significantly exceeds your proposed amount.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. I believe this reflects its true worth while acknowledging your initial offer.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product holds value for you, but $1,750,000 is still far beyond my budget.  I can offer $600,000, reflecting my serious interest while acknowledging the gap between our valuations.",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious, but we're still quite far apart. I'm willing to consider a significantly lower price, but $600,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product.  My final offer is $1,200,000. This is a substantial compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair offer.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,200,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant investment for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $750,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",750000.0,Bob,6,
