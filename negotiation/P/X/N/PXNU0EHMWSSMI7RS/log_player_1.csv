"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This gives me a good starting point and allows for room to negotiate downwards. Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, it's best to start high and see how he reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to see if I can push him closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm counter-offering at $9,500. This shows Bob I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still trying to get as close to my desired price as possible.  This hopefully will make him see the value in reaching a deal quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's getting closer, I think there's still room for improvement. I'm going to keep trying to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9400}
```

I'm counter-offering at $9,400. I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds. I'm going to see if I can get Bob to meet me halfway with this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. Although it's not my ideal price, it's getting close to my minimum and I'm running out of rounds.  There's a risk that he might reject my next offer or I might have to sell to John for a much lower price. Accepting this offer is the most practical choice at this point."
