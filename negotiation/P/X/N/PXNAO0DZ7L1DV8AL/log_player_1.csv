Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Fairness:**  I'm framing the offer as fair, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  I'm not setting a hardline price, allowing Bob to make a counteroffer without feeling pressured. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay my minimum price provides me with leverage throughout the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I am proposing to purchase the product for $1,050,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum than his initial assessment, it's still below the $1,200,000 I need to make this worthwhile.
* **Leverage with John:** I have a guaranteed sale to John at my desired price, giving me leverage to push Bob further. 
* **Counteroffer Potential:** I can likely get closer to my target by making a counteroffer.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain control of the negotiation and have the opportunity to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, I need to stay closer to my original asking price to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This is a significant compromise, but it's the best I can offer at this time. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm aiming for a compromise that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while still protecting my interests.
* **Highlighting Compromise:** I emphasize that this is a compromise, making it more likely Bob will see it as a reasonable offer.
* **Leaving Room for Finality:** By saying this is ""the best I can offer,"" I'm suggesting a final offer, potentially encouraging Bob to accept. 

My goal is to get as close to my minimum price as possible while still leaving room for negotiation in case Bob is unwilling to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I've reviewed my budget once again and I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I propose purchasing the product for $1,060,000. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is only $40,000 away from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:** Continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better price, and could risk losing Bob entirely.
* **Time and effort:**  Continuing negotiations would require additional time and effort, which could be better spent on other ventures.

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting Bob's offer is the most pragmatic decision at this point. It minimizes the risk of losing a potential sale and allows me to move on to other opportunities."
