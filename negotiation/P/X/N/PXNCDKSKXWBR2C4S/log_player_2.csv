# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,400,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair offer.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go down to $1,300,000. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,320,000. This is my best price, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob has reached a point where the price is getting closer to his budget, but he still needs to save some money. He knows he can buy the product from John for $1,200,000. It's in Bob's best interest to accept John's offer and avoid further negotiation. He's not guaranteed to get a better price with Alice, and the risk of losing a better deal with John is too high."
