"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair offer.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go down to $1,300,000. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,320,000. This is my best price, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point.",1320000.0,Alice,5,
