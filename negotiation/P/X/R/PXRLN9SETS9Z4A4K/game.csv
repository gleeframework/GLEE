"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm offering it to you for $12,000, which is a great price considering its value. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your time, Alice, and I'm really interested in the product. However, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? I'm confident you'll find this product to be worth every penny.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $10,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,200, but that's as high as I can go.",9200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit, but $9,200 is still a long way from what this product is actually worth.  Let's split the difference and I'll take $10,000. This is my final offer before I consider other options.",10000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a limit, but I can't go any lower than $9,800. This is a fair compromise considering the value of this product.  If you're truly serious about buying it, I'm willing to take this final offer. Otherwise, I'll be moving on to other options.",9800.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,800 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but that's as high as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options.",9500.0,Bob,8,
