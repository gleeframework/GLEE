"Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate the value you see in it, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a price of $1200000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1200000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $1350000?  This would allow me to still make a reasonable profit, while giving you a significant discount from my original offer.  Let's work together to make this happen.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
