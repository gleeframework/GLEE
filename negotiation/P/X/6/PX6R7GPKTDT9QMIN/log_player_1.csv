Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob while ensuring he doesn't reject the offer.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $100.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  We have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John if Bob refuses.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $140 creates a win-win situation. Bob gets a $40 discount from his perceived value, and you make a $40 profit compared to selling to John.

This approach aims for a quick and profitable sale while leaving Bob feeling like he got a good deal."
