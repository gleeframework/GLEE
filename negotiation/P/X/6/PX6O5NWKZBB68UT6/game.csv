"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is my final offer in this range, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,100,000 is still a bit too steep for me. How about we settle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but $950,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000, which is closer to my minimum price. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
