Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is my final offer in this range, so I hope we can come to an agreement.

Alice seems stuck on the higher price point and is not budging significantly. It's unlikely further negotiation will get her below John's offer of $1,000,000.  It's time to cut my losses and buy from John."
