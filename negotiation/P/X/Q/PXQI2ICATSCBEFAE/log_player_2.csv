"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 87}
```

**Explanation:**

Since Alice is willing to go down to $90, we're now in a closer range. This counteroffer of $87 shows you're serious about buying the product but also willing to compromise. This is a small enough increase from your previous offer that it might persuade Alice to accept, but still gets you closer to your goal of $80."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $92 is better than Alice's first offer, it's still higher than your target price of $80, and you're starting to get the impression that Alice is not willing to budge much further. At this point, it's more beneficial to go with the guaranteed price of $80 from John, as it saves you time and ensures you get the product within your budget."
