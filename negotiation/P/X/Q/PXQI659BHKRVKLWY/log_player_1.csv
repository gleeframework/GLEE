Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $19,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you should aim higher with Bob.
* **High Starting Point:**  $19,000 creates a strong anchor point and leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Sense of Urgency and Value:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" encourages Bob to act quickly and perceive higher value.

**Important:**  While you have a safety net with John, overpricing the product significantly might make Bob lose interest completely. This offer balances ambition with a degree of realism."
