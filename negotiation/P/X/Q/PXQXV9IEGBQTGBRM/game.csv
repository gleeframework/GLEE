"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you've highlighted, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given my budget and the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $8,500. This reflects a significant saving for you and still allows me to acquire the product.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. After careful consideration, I am pleased to counter your offer with a price of $9,000 for the product. This price reflects a compromise between our initial positions and still offers a good value for both parties involved. I hope this revised proposal aligns more closely with your budget while maintaining a fair valuation for our product. Let me know if you would like to discuss further details or consider this counteroffer.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $8,500.  This represents a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good deal considering the value we've both discussed.  I hope we can reach an agreement at this price.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I respect your position and understand the value you place on the product. After reviewing our conversation, I am willing to reconsider our previous offers and propose a final price of $8,750 for the product. This price aims to provide a reasonable compromise between our initial proposals, allowing you to benefit from a good deal while still ensuring a fair valuation for our product.

"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground, but $8,750 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  Considering John is willing to sell the product to me for $8,000, I can't justify going any higher.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $8,500.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I hope you'll reconsider.",8500.0,Bob,6,
