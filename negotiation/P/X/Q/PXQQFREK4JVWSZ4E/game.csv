"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to do $105? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy it today.",105.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $110? It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth it.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $110 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $107. Let's split the difference and make this deal happen.",107.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $107 is still a bit too low for me.  How about $112? It's a fair price that's closer to my value for the product. Let's try to make this deal happen.",112.0,Alice,5,
