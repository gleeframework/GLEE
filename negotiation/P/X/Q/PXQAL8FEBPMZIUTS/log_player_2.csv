**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $950,000 is still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000 and her own valuation of $800,000. 
* By rejecting her offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price or proceed with your alternative option of buying from John for $1,000,000. While buying from John doesn't save you money, it prevents you from overpaying significantly."
