Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's an offer that aims to maximize your profit while considering Bob's valuation:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product which I believe holds significant value for you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $1,200,000.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. It's unlikely he'll reject outright since it's still below his perceived value.
* **Maximizing Profit:** This price point aims to secure the highest possible profit while keeping the offer attractive to Bob. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might want to start slightly higher (but still below $1,500,000).
* **Market Conditions:**  If similar products are selling for even higher prices, you might adjust your offer upward.

This offer balances your interests with Bob's, increasing the likelihood of a successful sale at a price that benefits you greatly."
