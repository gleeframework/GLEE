"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high, at $20,000. This is a strong opening offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. I believe it's important to start high and see if Bob is willing to meet my expectations.  If he rejects, we'll see how his counteroffer compares and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $12,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000. While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to sell for such a low price. I'll counter with a higher offer in the next round, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $17,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing flexibility, but still above my minimum value. I hope this price is appealing enough for Bob to consider, while also securing a decent profit for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $14,000 is closer to my minimum value, I still believe I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round, hoping to find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $15,500. This price is still above my minimum value of $15,000, but I'm now getting closer to what Bob seems willing to pay. I believe this offer is a good compromise that could lead to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $15,000. We've reached a point where Bob's counteroffers are consistently below my minimum value. I don't want to risk going further and ending up with a lower price, especially with John offering a guaranteed $15,000. This ensures I meet my minimum profit goal and closes the deal efficiently."
