"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1400000. I believe it's a fair price given the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can try to get a lower price by making a counteroffer. The goal is to save as much money as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $1,250,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you a good profit and me a significant savings."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1250000 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1325000? This would allow us both to make a reasonable deal.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, and $1,325,000 is a good compromise. Buying from Alice at this price saves Bob $175,000 compared to buying from John.  While further negotiation might be possible, the risk of Alice walking away or Bob losing out on a good deal outweighs the potential for further savings."
