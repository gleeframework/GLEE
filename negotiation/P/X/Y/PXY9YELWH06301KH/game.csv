"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value you've placed on it. I hope you'll consider this offer.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a significant discount from the original price, but I believe it's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,000,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product. I hope we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I can see you're serious about getting this product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $950,000, which is as low as I'm willing to go. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point.",950000.0,Alice,5,
