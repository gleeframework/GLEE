"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to you:** The product is worth $150 to you.
* **Alice's offer:** Alice is offering the product for $140.
* **John's offer:** John is offering the product for $150.

Since Alice's offer is lower than your maximum value and lower than John's offer, it's the best deal available.  Accepting Alice's offer allows you to save $10 compared to buying from John."
