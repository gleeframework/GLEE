"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm hoping we can find a price closer to my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Bob,2,

This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it also allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know your thoughts.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,625,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,640,000 as a final compromise.  This price reflects the value of the product to you while ensuring I can still make a decent profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement this time.",1640000.0,Alice,5,
