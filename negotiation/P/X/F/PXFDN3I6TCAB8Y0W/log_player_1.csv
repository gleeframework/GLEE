Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $950,000. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $850,000 is a good offer, I'm still aiming to get closer to my ideal price. I will counter with a slightly lower price than my original offer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000. This is a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. I hope this will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, while still getting me a good price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $875,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident that I can't get much higher with further negotiations. It's better to accept this offer and secure the sale, rather than risk another rejection from Bob or losing time trying to push for a higher price."
