"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not sure I can meet you at $120. I'm willing to consider $160, which is a fair price for the value it brings. Let me know if that works for you.",160.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $140 and $160, so I'm offering it to you for $150. That's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value it brings.",150.0,Alice,5,
