"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique qualities and potential for your business, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the market value, however, the value of this product to me is quite significant and $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,250,000? This would be a fair compromise, don't you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with $1,250,000. I'd be willing to meet you at $1,150,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $1,200,000.  Would you consider $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget at $1,225,000. I'd be willing to consider $1,175,000, which is the lowest I can go.",1175000.0,Bob,6,
