"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $18,000 for it, but I'm open to discussing the price further. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $18,000 is higher than Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.  Therefore, rejecting the offer and counter-offering is the best strategy at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I appreciate your offer, $15,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit though. How about $16,500? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $16,500 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.  While it's closer to his desired price, rejecting the offer and counter-offering again is the better strategy to try to get a lower price.  There are still several rounds left, so Bob has time to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $16,500 is closer, but still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $16,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 16000}
