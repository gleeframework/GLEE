"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you would really love. It's worth a lot to you, so I'm offering it to you at a special price. What do you say to [product price]? Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

While $120 is lower than your maximum budget, you can likely get a better price. Alice is clearly motivated to sell, and there's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you might be able to get Alice to come down to a price closer to her $80 value."
