"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to make a counteroffer. While $13000 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $14000? This would still be a good deal for you, and it's a price I can feel comfortable with. Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,3,
