Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 because you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, meaning he has a potential profit of $200,000 if he buys from you.
* **Your Goal:** Maximize your profit. Ideally, you want to capture as much of Bob's potential profit as possible.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is a fair reflection of its value.  This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:**  $1,150,000 is a strong starting point. It leaves Bob with a $50,000 potential profit, which is still a significant incentive.
* **Exclusivity and Urgency:** By framing it as an ""exclusive opportunity"" and mentioning ""other interested parties,"" you create a sense of urgency and scarcity, encouraging Bob to act quickly.
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating why the price is justified, using phrases like ""fair reflection of its value"" subtly implies you've considered its worth carefully.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate. Bob might counter-offer, and you'll need to decide how much you're willing to concede to close the deal."
