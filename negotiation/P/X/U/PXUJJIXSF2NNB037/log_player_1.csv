Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. How about $1,225,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000

At this point, Bob's offer of $1,225,000 is a reasonable compromise. It's significantly more than John's offer, and continuing negotiations might not yield a much better outcome.  It's always possible Bob could walk, so accepting now secures a strong profit."
