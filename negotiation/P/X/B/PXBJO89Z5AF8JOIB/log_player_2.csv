You have three options:

You should reject Alice's offer.  You can get a better deal by counteroffering.  You have room to negotiate since you are willing to pay up to $150 and Alice is willing to sell for as low as $80."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:

``` 
At this point, it's best to accept Alice's offer of $130.  You're still saving $20 compared to buying from John, and it's likely that further negotiation will only lead to more back and forth without a significant price drop."
