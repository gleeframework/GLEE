Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $16,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price.  I can still sell to John for $15,000 if I don't get a better offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. Would you be willing to consider $17,000? That's a fair compromise, and I think it's still a good deal for you."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $16,500? I think that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer more,  $16,500 is closer to my asking price and a better deal than selling to John. I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
