Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This is a high offer, but it gives you a chance to maximize your profit. If Bob accepts, you make a good profit. If he rejects, you can still sell it to John for your minimum acceptable price. 

It's important to note that there's no guarantee Bob will accept, even at this high price. The key here is to balance your desire for a higher profit with the risk of losing the deal entirely."
