"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on a high-quality item. As we discuss the price, I'd like to start with an offer of $9,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

You can save money by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer.  $9,000 is still more than the product is worth to you."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be happy to offer you $7,500. This is a fair price considering your value of $8,000, and it gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 7500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $8,200, which is still a good deal for both of us. It's closer to my original price, but I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your desired price, you can still save more by rejecting and making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $8,200 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we settle on $7,800? This is a fair price that is closer to my initial offer, and still leaves room for both of us to make a profit."", ""product_price"": 7800}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $7,800 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to consider a price of $8,100, which is still a good compromise considering the value of the product. I think this is a fair price that takes into account both our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, it's best to accept Alice's offer.  You're getting the product for $8,100, which is a significant saving compared to John's $12,000 price. While you could continue negotiating, there's a good chance you won't get a better deal, and you risk Alice walking away from the deal altogether."
