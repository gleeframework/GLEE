Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can do $130, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great product, and I think it's worth every penny!

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $125, but that's as close as I can get to $120. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go any lower. Accepting the $125 offer secures a reasonable deal and avoids the risk of losing the product entirely."
