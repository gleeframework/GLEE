"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price point, so please let me know your thoughts.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $20,000 is significantly higher than what I'm looking to spend. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $20,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $17,000.  I believe this price reflects a fair compromise.  What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While I see the value in the product, $17,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your continued interest. I understand your budget constraints, and I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.  How about we settle at $14,500? This feels like a fair compromise.",14500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for sticking with this.  I'm willing to move a little higher, how about $13,000? That's about as high as I can go.",13000.0,Bob,6,
