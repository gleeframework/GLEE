"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is my best offer, considering my budget and the value I see in the product.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget, and I'm glad you see the value in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is my final offer, but I'm willing to negotiate further if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
