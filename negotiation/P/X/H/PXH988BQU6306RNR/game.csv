"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit outside my budget.  Would you be willing to do $80?  I'm really keen on this product, but that's the highest I can go.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $80. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $100. That's the lowest I can go. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,3,
