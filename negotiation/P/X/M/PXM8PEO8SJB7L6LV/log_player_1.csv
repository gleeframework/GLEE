Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer but that price is a little high for me. I'm willing to pay $650,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $650,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about we try $725,000? I think that's a fair offer considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offers, indicating a willingness to negotiate. We are still significantly above John's offer, so it's worth continuing the negotiation to try and get closer to our desired price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, you're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $825,000? I think that's a very competitive price considering its potential for you."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a fair deal for both of us. I'm willing to meet you at $775,000. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob's offer is now very close to our fallback option of selling to John.  While we could try to push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk that Bob will walk away. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk getting stuck with a lower offer later."
