"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will reject it. This sets the stage for negotiation and gives me room to come down in subsequent rounds.  The price is higher than my minimum value, allowing me to potentially make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000. I want to see if I can get closer to my goal by continuing negotiations. Selling to John for $15,000 is a safe option, but I'm hoping to maximize my profit through negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price from $18,000 to $16,000, which is still above my minimum value of $15,000 and potentially a reasonable price for Bob considering he's already offered $12,000. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a favorable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $13,000 is closer to my minimum value, I still believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate. I'm not yet in a position where selling to John for $15,000 is the most appealing option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm further lowering my price to $14,500. This is still above my minimum value of $15,000 and shows a willingness to compromise.  At this point, I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob that allows both of us to be satisfied with the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and Bob's offer of $13,500 is still below my minimum value of $15,000. While continuing to negotiate might yield a better price, the risk of getting stuck with a lower offer is increasing.  

At this point, selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me a profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation.  It's a safe and reliable decision."
