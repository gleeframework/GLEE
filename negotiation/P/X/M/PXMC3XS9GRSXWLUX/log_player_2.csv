Alice's offer:

**Reasoning:** Alice is unlikely to go much lower than her current offer of $92.50.  At this point, it's more beneficial to cut your losses and buy from John for $100.  While you could try to haggle with Alice further, you risk her increasing the price or the negotiation dragging on."
