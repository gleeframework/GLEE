"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's initial offer is too high. It's above your maximum budget of $8,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in this product but my budget is capped at $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is still just a little too low.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still above my comfort zone.  I've been negotiating for a while and I don't want to risk going over my limit.  Buying from John at $8,000 guarantees I get the product within my budget."
