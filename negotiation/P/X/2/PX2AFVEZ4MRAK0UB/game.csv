"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in this product but my budget is capped at $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000? This would be a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is still just a little too low.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's close this deal.",9250.0,Alice,5,
