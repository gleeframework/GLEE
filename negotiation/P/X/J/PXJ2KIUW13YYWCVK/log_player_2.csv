"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm confident it will significantly benefit your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a key asset at a fair price.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

* **Your value:** $1,000,000
* **John's offer:** $1,000,000
