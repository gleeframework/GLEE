Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your final offer. I appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $910,000 is very close to my target price of $900,000.  While I could try to negotiate further, there is a risk that she will reject my counteroffer and I may have to purchase from John at a higher price.  Given that I only have 3 rounds left, accepting this offer is the most sensible option."
