"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,000,000. It's a steal for something worth far more.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Initial Offer:**  I'm starting high to establish a strong negotiating position.  
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the product's worth to encourage Bob to see the potential.
* **Open-Ended Question:**  I'm prompting Bob to respond, giving him a chance to engage. 

This strategy aims to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get him to counteroffer, giving me more information to work with in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1000000 is significantly outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $700000 at this time. Let me know if this is a starting point we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $700,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. Accepting would result in a loss.
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is low, his message indicates he's interested in the product. This gives me an opportunity to negotiate further. 
* **John is a Safe Option:** Selling to John guarantees $800,000, but I'm still hopeful I can get a better price from Bob.  

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range, aiming to find a middle ground that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $700,000 isn't feasible for me, I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This recognizes your budget while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit. Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I've lowered my price from $1 million to $850,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. This represents a compromise that might be more appealing to Bob.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I've reframed the offer as a way to achieve a win-win scenario, emphasizing that it allows both of us to benefit.
* **Maintaining Firmness:**  My counteroffer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, ensuring I don't undervalue the product. 

This strategy aims to keep the negotiation moving forward while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $800000? This would allow me to make the purchase and would still provide you with a reasonable profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  Accepting this offer allows me to achieve my goal of selling the product for at least $800,000.
* **Time is a Factor:**  We're already in round 4.  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing time and potentially losing the deal altogether.
* **Equal Value Exchange:** While I could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee I'll get a higher price.  This offer represents a fair exchange of value.

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale."
