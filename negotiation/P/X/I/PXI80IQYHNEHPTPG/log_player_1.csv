Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (You'll sell to John at this price)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000 
* **Potential Profit for Bob:** $200,000 (if he buys at your minimum)

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, but offering a price too close to $1,200,000 increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer.  A good strategy is to aim for a price that gives Bob a significant portion of the potential profit while still securing a substantial gain for yourself.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's something that could be incredibly valuable to you. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its potential worth."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Price:**  $1,100,000 leaves Bob with a $100,000 potential profit, a strong incentive to buy.
* **Message:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value to Bob and presenting the price as fair rather than a hard bargain. 

**Important Considerations**

* This is just one possible offer. You could experiment with slightly higher prices, but moving too close to $1,200,000 significantly increases the risk of losing Bob as a buyer.
* Bob's actual willingness to pay is unknown. There's always a chance he might be willing to pay even more than $1,100,000, but this offer balances risk and potential reward."
