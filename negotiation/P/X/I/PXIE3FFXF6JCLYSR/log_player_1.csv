"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its immense potential and value, I'm offering it at $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the substantial return on investment you'll experience."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with the highest possible price ($1,000,000) makes sense as an initial strategy. Here's why:

* **Anchoring:** This establishes a high anchor point in Bob's mind. Even if he doesn't accept this price, it sets the stage for further negotiation.
* **Information Gathering:** Bob's reaction to this initial offer will give me valuable insight into his perception of the product's worth and his willingness to pay.
* **Alternative Option:** I always have the security of selling to John for my minimum acceptable price. 

It's important to note that this is a strong opening move, and I'm prepared to negotiate down if needed. However, starting high allows me to maximize my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get out of it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a significant sum, I'm not willing to accept a $100,000 loss when I have another buyer ready at $1,000,000.  Bob's offer indicates he's serious and sees value in the product, but I need to push for a better price. Rejecting his offer opens the door for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price. I'm willing to negotiate, but $900,000 is below my minimum. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This reflects the product's true value while recognizing your interest."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant concession of $50,000 to show Bob I'm willing to negotiate and find common ground.
* **Maintaining Value:**  By proposing $950,000, I'm still aiming for a price significantly higher than his initial offer and closer to my desired outcome.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By emphasizing ""meeting in the middle,"" I'm subtly suggesting a sense of urgency to encourage a quicker deal.

My goal is to create an offer enticing enough to avoid losing Bob entirely while still leaving room for potential further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $920,000, but I think that's the maximum I can stretch. Can you consider meeting me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my acceptable range, but I'm still leaving $80,000 on the table compared to John's offer.  At this stage, the risk of losing Bob to continued negotiation is relatively low. He's clearly interested and willing to move on price. I'll push a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and understand you're trying to find a comfortable price point.  Let's bridge the gap â€“ how about $935,000?  It's a strong show of my willingness to close this deal and reflects the value you're gaining."",
""product_price"": 935000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This offer splits the difference between our last positions ($920,000 and $950,000), a common negotiation tactic that can signal fairness and encourage acceptance. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to keep Bob focused on the long-term benefits and justify the price.
* **Time Pressure:**  While I'm not explicitly mentioning the limited rounds, moving closer to the middle ground subtly creates a sense that we need to reach an agreement soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad you're willing to meet me halfway. However, $935,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $915,000, but that's the absolute maximum I can stretch. Can you consider meeting me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $915,000 is still a significant $85,000 less than what John is offering.  While there's a chance I could negotiate Bob up slightly, the incremental gain is unlikely to be worth the risk of losing John's guaranteed offer.  

At this point, the potential upside of continuing with Bob is outweighed by the certainty of a $1,000,000 sale to John.  It's time to move on and secure the guaranteed profit."
