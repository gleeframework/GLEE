Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $2,300,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've stated. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest. While I appreciate your offer, the $1,200,000 price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about we consider $1,750,000?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,750,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've stated, and it's the highest I can go. If this doesn't work, I'll have to look elsewhere.

Bob is unwilling to budge from his $1,200,000 offer. While further negotiation might be possible, it's unlikely to yield a result significantly better than John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000.  It makes more financial sense to accept the guaranteed sale at this point."
