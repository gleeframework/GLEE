I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters, and hopefully, he'll see the value of the product and be willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my counteroffer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's a good amount, it's still below my desired price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

I'm coming down to $1,300,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but still leaves some margin for profit.  Hopefully, Bob will see that this is a fair price and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough call, but I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still significantly more than what I would get from John.  The risk of continuing negotiations is that I might end up getting a lower price or having to sell to John for $1,000,000.  I think $1,250,000 is a good compromise and a reasonable outcome."
