"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth more than your assessment. My initial offer is $15,000. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to counter. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $15,000 is way over his budget, and he can likely get a better price by negotiating."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay $10,000.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your interest in our product. I would like to make a counteroffer at $12,500. This price reflects the value I place on the product and aims to bridge the gap between our previous offers. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, it's still higher than his ideal price. He can try to negotiate further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, but that's my absolute top offer. Let me know if you're able to accept that."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your effort to reach an agreement, Bob. Considering the value of the product and our previous discussions, I am willing to consider $11,500 as a final offer. This price reflects a compromise while still ensuring a reasonable profit for us. I hope this proposal is within your acceptable range. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than his maximum budget.  Since John is willing to sell the product for $10,000, which is within Bob's budget, it makes sense to buy from John and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
