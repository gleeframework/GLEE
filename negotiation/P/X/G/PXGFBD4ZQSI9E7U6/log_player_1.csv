"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above my minimum value of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm curious to see how Bob reacts to this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm going to reject it and see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. There are still 8 rounds left, so I have some room to maneuver."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $95. This is a compromise, halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I still believe the product is worth more than $85."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is getting closer to my desired price.  While I'd prefer a little more, it's within a reasonable range, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether by continuing to counter-offer.  It's better to accept and secure a good price rather than push for a higher one and potentially end up with nothing."
