"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $75? ",75.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go down to $75 just yet. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $82.50. It's a great compromise that still benefits both of us.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the compromise. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit over budget at $82.50. How about we meet in the middle at $80?  That would be a fair deal for both of us.",80.0,Bob,4,
