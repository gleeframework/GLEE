Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000,  it's worth trying to get a higher price from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $14,000 leaves room for potential negotiation while still being a significant amount above Bob's perceived value. 
* **Time Value:** Selling to Bob quickly might be preferable even if it means a slightly lower profit than waiting for John. 

This offer aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and increasing the likelihood of a successful sale to Bob."
