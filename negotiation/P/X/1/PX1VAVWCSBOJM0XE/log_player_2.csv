"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  You can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer.  The goal is to save as much money as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to spend closer to $1,000,000, but I'm still a bit far from that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great compromise, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is still a good deal for Bob. It's below his maximum budget of $1,500,000 and closer to his desired price of $1,000,000. While further negotiation is possible, it's likely that Alice won't go lower, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price without risking losing it to John."
