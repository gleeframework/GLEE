Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.

We're still getting a better deal than John's price. Let's see if we can negotiate further."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $10,200. This is as low as I can go without losing money on the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate down from her initial offer, but we're getting close to John's price. We need to signal that we're serious about getting a significant discount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,200 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,200, but that's my final offer. If you can't agree to that, I'll have to consider John's offer."",
""product_price"": 9200
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Firmness:**  By saying ""final offer"" and mentioning John's offer, we signal that we're serious about the price and might walk away.
* **Significant Discount:** We're aiming for a $800 discount from John's price, which is a reasonable goal.
* **Compromise:** We're still showing a willingness to compromise by moving up from our previous offer.

This strategy aims to balance firmness with flexibility, increasing our chances of securing a good deal without losing out to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I respect that. However, I'm not willing to go below $10,000. That's my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,200 and $10,000. I can offer it to you for $9,600. This is my final counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to our target:** Alice has come down to $9,600, which is a $400 saving compared to John's offer. 
* **""Final Counteroffer"":**  Alice has indicated this is her best price. Continuing negotiations likely won't result in a significantly better deal.
* **Time Constraint:** We're getting closer to the 10-round limit, and risking a better deal with Alice isn't worth the potential loss of buying from John at $10,000. 

Accepting this offer secures a good price and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
