"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product.  I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm asking for $14,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $11,000.  Let's see if we can make a deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I see you're serious about this product. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is a good deal:**  $12,500 is significantly lower than John's offer of $15,000, and still allows Bob to save some money.
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:** While Bob could try to counter-offer again, it's likely Alice won't go much lower. The risk of losing the deal entirely by pushing too hard isn't worth the potential small savings. 

By accepting, Bob secures a good price and avoids the risk of losing out on the product altogether."
