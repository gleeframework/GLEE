"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a good profit while leaving room for negotiation.  I'm confident Bob will be interested, given the product's value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get a higher price. I'll counteroffer and see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly to $9,500. This is still a good profit for me, and I'm hoping Bob will see it as a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's latest offer is the same as what John is willing to pay.  Given that we're already at round 4 and there's a risk of further negotiation rounds with Bob potentially ending in a lower price, I'll choose to sell to John now and secure a guaranteed $8,000."
