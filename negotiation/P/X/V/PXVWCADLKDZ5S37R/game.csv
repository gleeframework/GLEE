"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $15,000.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $8,500 at this time.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $8,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $13,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we split the difference at $10,500? This is a fair compromise for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,500 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $12,000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,5,
