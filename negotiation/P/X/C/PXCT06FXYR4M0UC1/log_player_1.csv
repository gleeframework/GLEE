Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth a lot to me, but I believe it would be a valuable asset for your business as well. I'm offering it to you for $1,700,000. This is a significant discount from what I would get elsewhere.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $1,700,000 is a price that is higher than Bob's valuation but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. This creates room for negotiation and potential for a win-win scenario. 
* **Message:** The message focuses on the product's value for Bob's business while highlighting the discount compared to other potential buyers. This creates urgency and encourages Bob to consider the offer seriously.

**Why this strategy?**

* **Maximize profit:**  $1,700,000 is still a substantial profit for me while still being potentially appealing to Bob.
* **Negotiation leverage:**  By having a backup buyer (John), I have the leverage to push for a higher price than Bob's initial valuation.
* **Win-win potential:**  Bob might be willing to pay a bit more than his initial valuation for a product that is valuable to his business."
