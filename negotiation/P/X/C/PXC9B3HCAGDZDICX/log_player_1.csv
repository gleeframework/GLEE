Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I think you might be interested in. I'm asking $10,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Starting at $10,000 gives me room to negotiate and still potentially make more than my minimum of $8,000. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Being open to negotiation demonstrates flexibility and encourages Bob to counteroffer, giving us a chance to find a mutually acceptable price.
* **John as Safety Net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $8,000 provides a strong fallback position. If the negotiation with Bob doesn't yield a satisfactory price, I can always move on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $8,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price.  
* **No room for profit:**  There's no potential to earn more with further negotiation.
* **Time is valuable:**  Continuing to negotiate risks losing time and potentially missing out on other buyers or opportunities.

Selling to John immediately guarantees my minimum desired profit and avoids any further uncertainty."
