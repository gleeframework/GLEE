"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  I'm happy to start the negotiations at $1,600,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of what's being offered.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $1,600,000 is far too high for me. While I'm interested in the product, I can't go above $800,000.  Let's start there and see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down some. However, $1,400,000 is still too high.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  That's a significant increase from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I'm motivated to make a deal. To show you my commitment, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is my final offer.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still out of my price range. I'm ready to close the deal at $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and it's the highest I can go. Let me know if you're interested.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
