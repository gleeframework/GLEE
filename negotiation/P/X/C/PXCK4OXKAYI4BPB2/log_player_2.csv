"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  I'm happy to start the negotiations at $1,600,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,600,000 is way above his budget, and he has other options.  It's best to see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $1,600,000 is far too high for me. While I'm interested in the product, I can't go above $800,000.  Let's start there and see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,400,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $1,400,000 is still above his budget and he's already stated his maximum.  He should counter again, hopefully getting closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down some. However, $1,400,000 is still too high.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  That's a significant increase from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I'm motivated to make a deal. To show you my commitment, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a lower price than before, it's still above his budget. He has a guaranteed option with John at $800,000, and there's still some room for negotiation with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still out of my price range. I'm ready to close the deal at $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and it's the highest I can go. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
