``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum of $8,000, leaving room for potential negotiation.  It also leaves room for Bob to make a counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $8500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to close the deal and avoid further negotiation, I'm still hoping to get a better price closer to my initial offer of $9,500.  I think I can likely convince Bob to come up a bit in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? That would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $8750? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd like to get closer to my initial goal of $9,500, Bob's offer of $8,750 is still a good deal for me. It's above my minimum of $8,000 and closer to my target price than John's offer.  I'd rather close the deal and secure a decent profit than risk further negotiation and potentially ending up with a lower price or having to sell to John."
