Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm hoping to get closer to my ideal price, but I'm also open to negotiation if Bob's interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer of $90 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $80, and it is more than what I would get selling to John.  It's better to accept Bob's offer and make a profit."
