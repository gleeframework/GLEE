Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7500 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8250? That's a fair price considering the value of this product.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I think I've negotiated as much as I can with Alice. Since the price she's offering is now $8,000, which is the same price that John is offering, I think it's a good idea to stop negotiating with Alice and buy the product from John. I can save $200 by doing so.
