{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $9,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's valuation but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to get as close to my desired price as possible, but I also want to be flexible enough to secure a sale if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's far below my minimum price. I believe I can get closer to my goal by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,500 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,250? That's a fair price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $7875? That's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to keep negotiating and see if I can get him to budge further."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $7875 is still below my minimum.  To show I'm serious about making this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $8,000. That's a fair price, and I believe it's a win for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
