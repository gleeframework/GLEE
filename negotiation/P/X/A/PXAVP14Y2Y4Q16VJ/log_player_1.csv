Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $130. I believe it's a fair price considering its value."", 
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price slightly higher than what you're willing to accept. This leaves room for negotiation and might lead to a higher profit.
* **Not Too High:**  While starting high, it's important to be reasonable. Asking for something like $145 might make Bob walk away immediately. $130 allows room for negotiation while still being significantly above my minimum.
* **Justification:** By briefly mentioning ""fair price"" and ""value,"" I'm hinting at the product's worth without revealing my own minimum. 

This initial offer aims to find a balance between maximizing profit and keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a decent offer, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob's message suggests he's interested, and his counteroffer isn't drastically lower than my initial ask.  I'll try to meet him halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you countering, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $125? It's a great price for this product."", 
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  This is a common negotiation tactic that can be perceived as fair by both parties. 
* **Final Offer (Implied):**  By phrasing it as ""meeting in the middle,"" I'm subtly indicating that this might be my final offer before considering John's $100 backup.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm briefly mentioning ""great price"" again, subtly reinforcing the product's value in Bob's mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $122? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $122
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might irritate Bob or make him question the product's value. The potential gain from further negotiation ($3) is minimal compared to the risk of losing the sale entirely.
* **Reasonable Profit:**  $122 is still a $22 profit, which is a good deal considering my minimum acceptable price is $100. 
* **Time Value:**  Reaching a deal now avoids potentially lengthy negotiations and allows me to move on."
