# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is tailored to meet your specific needs and valued at $10,000. Given its high quality and the benefits it provides, I believe this is an excellent opportunity for you to enhance your operations or personal endeavors. Considering its worth and the value it brings, I am offering it to you at the same price of $10,000. Please let me know if you have any questions or need further information to make a decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Since Alice is offering the product at $10,000, which is the maximum you're willing to pay, there's no benefit to buying from her. You can get the product from John for the same price."
