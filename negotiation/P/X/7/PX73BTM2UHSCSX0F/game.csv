"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking to pay a bit less. Would you be willing to consider $13,000 for the product?  I'm confident this price is fair for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, but I'm not quite comfortable with the price of $13,000. Considering the value the product holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $13,750. This is the best I can do, but I'm confident it's still a fair price for both of us.",13750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $13,750 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm offering $13,500 for the product. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the deal.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not quite comfortable with the price of $13,500. Considering the value I place on the product, I'm willing to meet you at $14,000, but I'm not going any higher. This is my final offer, and I'm eager to hear your response.",14000.0,Alice,5,
