Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I believe would be a great asset to you. I'm asking for $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000 is a good starting point.** It's a fair price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price.
* **The message is friendly and positive.** This helps build rapport and makes Bob more likely to consider the offer.
* **I'm leaving the door open for negotiation.** By asking what Bob thinks, I invite him to counteroffer and keep the negotiation moving.

**Remember:** My goal is to maximize my profit, but I also need to be mindful of the risk of losing the sale entirely. If Bob rejects my offer, I can always move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I need to hold out for a better offer or move on to John. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counteroffer and potentially get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This product is really top-notch, and I believe it's worth the investment.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is closer to Bob's value:**  I'm bridging the gap by coming down to $11,000, showing flexibility while still staying above my minimum. 
* **Positive and encouraging message:**  I'm reinforcing the value of the product and keeping the conversation amicable.
* **Open to further negotiation:**  By asking ""What do you say?"", I invite Bob to counter again if he's not quite there yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product is top-notch, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $10,000. Can you meet me halfway and offer it to me for $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **$10,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.**  While it's getting closer, I'm not willing to settle for such a significant loss. 
* **I'm confident in my product's value.**  I know that John is willing to pay $15,000, so I can afford to be patient and hold out for a better offer from Bob. 
* **Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open.**  By continuing to negotiate, I might be able to get closer to my desired price or, at the very least, gain more information about Bob's willingness to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,500 is closer, but it's still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,250?  I'm really confident this product will exceed your expectations."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is a compromise:** I'm proposing $11,250, which is exactly halfway between my previous offer of $11,000 and Bob's offer of $10,500. This shows a willingness to meet him halfway.
* **Reinforce product value:** I'm reminding Bob about the product's quality and value, trying to motivate him to see the worth in the slightly higher price.
* **Maintain positive tone:** I'm keeping the conversation positive and friendly to maintain a good rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable going above $10,000. I'm willing to meet you at $10,750, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is now close to my desired price, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  At this point, I've already negotiated with Bob for a while, and it's clear that he's not willing to pay a price that reflects the product's true value to me.

Given that I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price, it makes more sense to sell to John and avoid further negotiation with Bob. This ensures I get my desired price and avoids the risk of a prolonged negotiation that might ultimately fail."
