,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This product is really top-notch, and I believe it's worth the investment.  What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product is top-notch, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $10,000. Can you meet me halfway and offer it to me for $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,500 is closer, but it's still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,250?  I'm really confident this product will exceed your expectations.",11250.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable going above $10,000. I'm willing to meet you at $10,750, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this offer?",10750.0,Bob,6,
