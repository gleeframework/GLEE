"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $180. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit out of my price range. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping to get.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a higher price, Alice. How about $115? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 115
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You drive a hard bargain, Bob!  How about we split the difference again and call it $127.50?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $127.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $127.50. It's better to save the money and buy from John for $120."
