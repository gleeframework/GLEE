Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  $11,500 is above your minimum of $10,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  By not offering the full $12,000 value to Bob, you leave room for a counter-offer and potentially reaching a price closer to your desired outcome.
* **It's a strong starting point:**  $11,500 is a significant price, showing you are serious about a good deal.

Remember, the key is to be flexible and willing to negotiate.  If Bob rejects your offer, you can then adjust your price based on his counter-offer and your willingness to deal with him versus selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's only $500 more than selling to John. By rejecting, we can try to secure a higher price through further negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? I'm confident you'll find the value of this product well worth it."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground here. How about $10,750? I believe that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,750 is only $250 less than our last counteroffer of $11,000. It's worth accepting this offer as we're getting closer to our desired price and it's significantly more than selling to John."
