"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you're interested in. I'm offering it to you for $17,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you."", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still below my minimum. 
* **Message:** I'm trying to build a rapport and frame the offer as a good deal. 
* **Strategy:** I want to see if Bob is willing to pay more than his perceived value, and this price allows for room for negotiation.

**Important Note:** This is just a starting point. I'll adapt my strategy based on Bob's response and keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $12,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum, and even lower than his perceived value.  
* **Strategy:** While I could accept his offer and get some money, it's not worth the loss. I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum by counter-offering and negotiating.  
* **John's Offer:** I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe I can potentially get a better deal from Bob.

**Next Round:**  I will counter-offer with a price closer to my minimum, but still leaving room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but it's significantly lower than what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $15,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 15000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm now offering my absolute minimum. This shows Bob I'm serious about selling, but also that I'm not willing to go lower.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging his counteroffer but emphasizing my minimum. I'm also trying to keep the negotiation open and positive, focusing on finding a compromise.
* **Strategy:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to carefully consider whether to accept John's offer or continue negotiating.  However, I'm hoping that Bob will recognize the value of the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position. I would like to counter with an offer of $14,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob's offer is close to my minimum, and given the limited rounds, it's a good opportunity to close the deal.
* **Strategy:**  While I could potentially get closer to my minimum,  I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. 
* **John's Offer:**  While John's offer is higher, I'm prioritizing closing the deal and getting a quick return on the product.

**Decision:** Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale, and I'm happy with the outcome, considering the limited rounds and the potential for further negotiation delays."
