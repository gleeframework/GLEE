Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but I'm still not willing to accept $710,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer a price of $725,000 again.

This is a tough one! Alice is clearly holding firm, and while we could try to push further, there's a real risk she walks away.  Getting it for $725,000 is a decent savings compared to John's $1,500,000 price.  It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing it entirely."
