"Alice, $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save even more. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to save even more. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,3,
