"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is your maximum budget, there's no reason to accept the first offer.  Rejecting allows you to potentially get a better deal. You have no information about Alice's bottom line, and there's always a chance she's willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significant counteroffer (20% below Alice's initial price)  shows that you are serious about negotiation and  are willing to walk away. This will also give you a better understanding of Alice's willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but it's still above your ideal range.  There's still room for further negotiation, and rejecting allows you to continue exploring if a lower price is possible.  There's no reason to accept an offer above your preferred price, especially when you have a fallback option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while staying within my budget.  The goal is to meet Alice halfway, prompting her to consider lowering her price further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has finally matched my counteroffer.  While I'd prefer to pay less, accepting this offer secures the product within my budget and saves me $1500 compared to buying from John.  There's a risk of further negotiation, but with only 5 rounds remaining, the potential savings are not worth the risk of losing the deal."
