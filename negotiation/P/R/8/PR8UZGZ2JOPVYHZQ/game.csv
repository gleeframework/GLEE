"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit higher than I was hoping to spend.  How about $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss $10,500? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this product.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm getting closer to a budget I'm comfortable with.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $9,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to think about the value this product will bring to your business. How about we meet at $10,200? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",10200.0,Alice,5,
