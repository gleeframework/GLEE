"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value you've placed on it, and it allows us both to walk away with a successful deal.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be compensated fairly for the value of this product. How about $1,250,000?  This price is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
