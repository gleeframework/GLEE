"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you.  Let's discuss this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be compensated fairly for the value of this product. How about $1,250,000?  This price is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than your desired price point, but it's getting closer.  Since you have the option to purchase from John for $1,200,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting this offer allows you to try to push for a lower price."
