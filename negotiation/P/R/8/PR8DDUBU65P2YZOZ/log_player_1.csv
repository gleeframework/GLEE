Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,900,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I know Bob values the product at $1,500,000 and I have a guaranteed buyer at that price, I want to start high to maximize my potential profit.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The offer of $1,900,000 allows room for Bob to negotiate down, while still potentially securing a price significantly higher than my minimum. 
* **Confident and positive language:**  The message is framed positively to emphasize the product's value and encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously. 
 
**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer.  Depending on Bob's response and negotiation tactics, I may be willing to adjust the price to secure the deal, knowing I have a fallback option with John."
