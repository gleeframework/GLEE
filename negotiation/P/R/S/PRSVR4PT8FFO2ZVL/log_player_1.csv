"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering Bob the product for $95. This is a good starting point as it's more than my minimum price of $80 but still leaves some room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $85 is better than selling to John, I think I can still get a slightly higher price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to counter with $90.  This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer. I think this is a fair price that might be acceptable to Bob, but still leaves me some room for profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, $87 is a good deal and it's better than selling to John for $80.  It's also likely that Bob won't offer any more, and I don't want to risk losing the deal."
