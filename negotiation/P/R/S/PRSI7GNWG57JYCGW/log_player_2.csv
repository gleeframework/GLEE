**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my target.  I'm confident we can negotiate further and hopefully reach a price closer to $1,000,000. There are still 8 rounds left, so there's time to continue negotiating."

**Reasoning:**

While $1,080,000 is a significant improvement from Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than my desired target of $1,000,000.  I'm confident that with continued negotiations, we can reach a price closer to my budget.  We have 5 rounds remaining, which gives us ample opportunity to find a mutually agreeable price."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as high as $1025000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm still getting a fair price for the product. I'm offering you a counteroffer of $1060000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a price closer to $1,000,000, we're nearing the end of the negotiation.  Accepting Alice's offer at $1,060,000 is a good compromise.  It's a significant savings compared to John's price of $1,500,000 and it leaves room for potential future negotiation if the product proves to be even more valuable than anticipated."
