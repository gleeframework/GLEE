"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $130 is my final offer.  It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  Let's close this deal.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $130 is still more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $115?  I'm serious about buying this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $115 is still a bit too low. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell it to you for $125.  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal.  What do you say?",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not comfortable paying $125.  How about we meet in the middle at $120?  That's my final offer.  If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to look elsewhere.",120.0,Bob,6,
