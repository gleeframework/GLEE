Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My minimum acceptable price:** I know the product is worth at least $12,000 to me, so I won't go lower than that.
* **Potential for a higher price:**  I'm aiming for a higher price, but I don't know Bob's valuation. Offering $15,000 gives me a good chance of getting a better price than my minimum while still being potentially attractive to Bob.
* **John as a safety net:**  I have a guaranteed buyer in John, so I can afford to take some risk with Bob. 

By offering $15,000, I maximize my potential earnings while still having a backup option if Bob rejects."
