"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider selling it for $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

This strategy is to start with a low offer, significantly below my $80 limit and far below Alice's asking price.  This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows me to secure a much lower price. Even if Alice rejects it, it gives me a sense of her bargaining range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price, $105 is still significantly higher than my budget and John's offer. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand we're looking for a price that works for both of us, Alice.  How about $75? That's a fair jump from my last offer and puts us closer to a deal."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic increase:** I've significantly increased my offer from $60 to $75, showing Alice I'm willing to negotiate and move towards a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Below budget, above midpoint:** This offer is still below my $80 maximum but sits above the midpoint between my initial low offer and her counteroffer. This aims to strike a balance between getting a good deal and keeping the negotiation moving. 
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer will help me gauge Alice's flexibility. If she accepts or counters with a price closer to $75, there's room for a successful negotiation. However, if she remains firm on a price above my budget, I can always opt for John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $75 is closer, it's still a bit low for me. How about $95? This brings the price closer to my initial offer while still giving you a discount. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above budget:** While Alice continues to decrease her price, $95 is still above your $80 maximum budget. 
* **Negotiating room:** Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and you haven't yet reached your limit. There's still potential to bargain for a price closer to your target.
* **John's offer as leverage:** You always have John's offer of $80 as a fallback. This gives you some leverage in knowing you don't have to settle for a price you're not comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm trying to stay within a tight budget, and $95 is a bit of a stretch for me. Would you be willing to do it for $80? That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and firm:** I'm being clear about my budget limitations and stating my final offer directly. This conveys that I'm serious and have reached my limit.
* **Meeting my maximum:** Offering $80 meets my maximum budget and matches John's offer. This ensures I get the best possible price, regardless of whether Alice accepts or not.
* **Leaving the decision to Alice:**  The ball is now in Alice's court. She can either accept the offer, counter with a price closer to $80, or I can gracefully walk away and buy from John."
