"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider selling it for $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $105?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand we're looking for a price that works for both of us, Alice.  How about $75? That's a fair jump from my last offer and puts us closer to a deal.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $75 is closer, it's still a bit low for me. How about $95? This brings the price closer to my initial offer while still giving you a discount.",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm trying to stay within a tight budget, and $95 is a bit of a stretch for me. Would you be willing to do it for $80? That's my final offer.",80.0,Bob,6,
