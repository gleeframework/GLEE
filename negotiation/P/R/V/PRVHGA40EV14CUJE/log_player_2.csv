"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good deal, it's not the best possible price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $12,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** Bob starts by offering $12,500. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial price of $14,000, but it's still above Alice's minimum desired price of $12,000. 
* **Message:** Bob expresses appreciation for Alice's offer while also stating his intention to negotiate a lower price. He frames the counteroffer as a ""fair price"" for both parties, making it more palatable to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12500 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13250.  This is a great deal for both of us, and it leaves room for both of us to be happy with the outcome.  Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Counteroffer:** Alice has come down to $13,250. This is still a good deal for Bob, as it's below his maximum budget of $15,000. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While there's always a chance for further negotiation, accepting this offer gives Bob a good price and avoids the risk of Alice further increasing her price or Bob running out of rounds. 
* **Avoiding John:** Accepting this offer also avoids Bob having to buy from John at the higher price of $15,000."
