"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's lower than Bob's maximum value of $15,000, giving him room to negotiate, but it's also significantly higher than your minimum value of $12,000, ensuring you profit.  We'll see how Bob responds and adjust our strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $12500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close to your minimum, but there's still room to negotiate and get a better price.  Rejecting his offer allows us to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,500 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,250.  This is a great deal for both of us, and it leaves room for both of us to be happy with the outcome.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 13250}
