Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable.  I've researched your needs and believe this is a perfect fit. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This offer reflects the value I place on a mutually beneficial deal.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob is willing to pay $1,500,000, so aiming close to that figure maximizes potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $1,400,000 leaves space for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Highlight Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, reinforcing his motivation to buy.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,200,000 provides a strong fallback position. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while having a guaranteed sale option with John if needed."
