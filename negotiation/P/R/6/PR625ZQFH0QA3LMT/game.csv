"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product, but  $1,500,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm happy to offer $1,100,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer and your interest in the product.  I understand your perspective on the price. While $1,500,000 represents its full value, I'm willing to meet you closer to your number to make this work. How about we settle on $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget, but I'm getting closer to what I can do.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,275,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
