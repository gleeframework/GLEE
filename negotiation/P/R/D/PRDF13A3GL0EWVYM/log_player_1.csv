"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  This price is a good starting point, but I'm prepared to negotiate. If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. I'll also keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option."
