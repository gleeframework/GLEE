"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $850,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering your asking price and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. However, $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product and allows us to reach an agreement. Let's close this deal.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While $825,000 is closer, it's still a bit out of my range. I'm prepared to offer $800,000 for the product, which is my absolute maximum.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's finalize this.",800000.0,Bob,4,
