"Alice, $900,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. It's a fair price, and I'm sure we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a middle ground here.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $825,000? I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also staying within my budget. Let's close this deal.",825000.0,Bob,4,
