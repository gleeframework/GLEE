"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at this point. We know we can get the product for $100 from John.  Rejecting the offer allows us to potentially get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**  We're starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a good discount.  $75 is a good starting point to test Alice's willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down from $100 to $85, which is a good discount.  At this point, it's worth accepting her offer, as we're saving $15 compared to buying from John.  There's always a risk of getting a better price later, but the potential gain is not significant enough to risk losing the deal entirely."
