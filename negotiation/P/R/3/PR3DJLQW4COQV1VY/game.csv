"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $150 is a bit too high for me. How about $105?  That's still a great price for you, and a good deal for me.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob! I can see that $105 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $137.50?",137.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $137.50 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm happy to go to $115.  This is a good price for both of us, and lets us make a deal.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to go to $115. How about we try $130? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Alice,5,
