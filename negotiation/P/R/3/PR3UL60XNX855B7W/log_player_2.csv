The product is worth $100 to Alice, and she is offering it for $110. This is already above my maximum budget. It's better to reject this offer and try to negotiate."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget. Although I'm close to a deal, it's not worth risking going further and potentially ending up with no deal at all.  I'll go with the guaranteed option and buy from John for $80."
