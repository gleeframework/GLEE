Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Negotiating Room:** Offering a price of $1,400,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" encourages Bob to act quickly and not risk losing the deal. 
* **Alternative Option:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,200,000 provides a safety net. This offer ensures Alice makes a substantial profit regardless of Bob's decision."
