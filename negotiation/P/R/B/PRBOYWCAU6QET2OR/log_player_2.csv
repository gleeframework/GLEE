# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is a better deal for Bob than buying from John for $1,000,000.  Even though Bob values the product at $1,000,000, saving $100,000 is a good outcome."
