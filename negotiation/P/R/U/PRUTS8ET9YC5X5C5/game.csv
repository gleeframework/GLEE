"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  That's still a great price for the value you'll get from the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but $10,750 is still too low for me. Let's try $10,900. It's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal. What do you say?",10900.0,Alice,5,
