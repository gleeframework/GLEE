"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to $800,000 to make this work.  Let's meet in the middle at $775,000. It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you say?",775000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable going above $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be closer to $762,500. That's the highest I can go. Can you consider that?",762500.0,Bob,4,
