Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

This is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a price higher than my minimum but not too high to scare Bob off.  I'll adjust based on his response and the value I perceive in continuing the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum, but I'm not satisfied with it. I'd like to see if I can get closer to my initial price before accepting.  I'll try a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to try a counteroffer that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this is attractive enough for him, but still leaves room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is only $500 less than my initial offer. I'm willing to accept that price, as it's still significantly better than selling to John for $12,000. It's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing out on this deal."
