"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However,  $1,800,000 is significantly below what I have in mind for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $2,050,000?",2050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I still think $2,050,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,900,000 for the product. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I also need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
