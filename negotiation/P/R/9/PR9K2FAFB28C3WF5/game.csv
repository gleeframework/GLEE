"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase.",130.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it!  However, $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be willing to come down to $125?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, $125 is still a bit lower than my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $135. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the product at this price.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you being willing to compromise, Alice. How about we split the difference and settle on $130? That would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident I'd be happy with the product.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $135. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $132. It's a small increase from your proposal, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",132.0,Alice,5,
