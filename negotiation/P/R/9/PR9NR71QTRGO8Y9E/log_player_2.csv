"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way above your budget.  You should reject and counter with a much lower offer, closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me at around $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:** Starting with a low offer ($8,000) leaves you room to negotiate up while still staying well below your $12,000 maximum. 
* **Gauging Flexibility:** This aggressive counter helps you understand how flexible Alice might be. If she's willing to come down significantly, it might be worth continuing the negotiation.
* **Alternative Option:**  Remember, you always have John's offer of $12,000 as a backup plan."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **At Budget:** Alice's offer of $12,000 matches your maximum budget. 
* **No Guarantee of Better:** There's no guarantee you can get a better price from Alice, even with more rounds of negotiation. 
* **John's Price:** John is also offering the product for $12,000, so there's no advantage to switching to him.

Take the win and accept the offer!"
