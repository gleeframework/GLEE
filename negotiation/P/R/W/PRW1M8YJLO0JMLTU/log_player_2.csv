"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,500 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows Bob to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  This would still give you a good profit and is closer to my budget."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  $13,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This still leaves some profit for me, and I'm hopeful it works for you. Let me know your thoughts.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $13,500, which is within Bob's budget and a better price than John's offer. Accepting the offer saves Bob $1,000 compared to John.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting and needing to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential for a small savings."
