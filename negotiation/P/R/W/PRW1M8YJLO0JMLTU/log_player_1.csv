Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  This would still give you a good profit and is closer to my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
