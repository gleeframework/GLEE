"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $150 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value ($120) to give myself room to negotiate.
* **Friendly tone:**  I'm using a friendly tone to build rapport and make Bob feel comfortable negotiating. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm letting Bob know that I'm open to hearing his thoughts and potentially adjusting the price.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while also giving Bob a chance to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable value, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Accepting immediately might leave money on the table. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $135? Let's try to make this work. "", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm counter-offering at $135, which is halfway between my initial asking price and Bob's offer.
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing a clear reason for my counter-offer, emphasizing fairness and compromise.
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone to keep the negotiation moving forward. 

By making a counter-offer and justifying it with a compromise, I'm aiming to find a price that both of us can agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Can we try $125? I'm willing to meet you halfway from the original offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Closing the deal:** Bob's offer of $125 is only $5 less than my initial asking price and is significantly higher than the price I could get from John. 
* **Minimizing risk:**  While I could continue to negotiate, there's a risk of losing Bob altogether and being left with John's offer of $120.  
* **Time factor:** With only 6 rounds remaining, it's becoming crucial to secure a deal.

Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get a good price for the product and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
