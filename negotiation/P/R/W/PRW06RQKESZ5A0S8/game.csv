"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm eager to find a deal that works for both of us, $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider at this time.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? I believe this reflects the true value of the product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your concerns, but I still think $1,050,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. How about we meet at $950,000? I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my means.",950000.0,Bob,4,
