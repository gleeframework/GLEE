"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the potential sale of this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you seem less desperate to sell quickly. 
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This initial high offer allows you to gauge Bob's level of interest and flexibility.  His response will give you valuable information about his willingness to pay.
* **Alternative Option:** Remember, you have John as a backup offer at $1,500,000. This knowledge gives you leverage and confidence in your negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. This product holds value, but not quite at that level. How about we bring it down to $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000).  While you want to earn as much as possible, accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss.  It's time to counter and see if you can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a proposal. However, your offer is significantly below the product's true value. To be fair, I can come down to $1,750,000."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Demonstrate Flexibility:**  By lowering your price, you show Bob you're willing to negotiate.
* **Strategic Counter:** You're making a significant move downward from your initial offer, but you are still well above both Bob's offer and your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Maintaining Value:** The message emphasizes the product's inherent value, justifying the higher price point.  

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while aiming for a price closer to your desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but we need to find a middle ground. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, he's still significantly below your minimum ($1,500,000). Accepting now would mean a loss of $400,000 compared to selling to John. You have room to negotiate further, so it's worth continuing the discussion and seeing if you can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to consider $1,600,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to close this deal."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** By coming down to $1,600,000, you're signaling a willingness to compromise while still staying above your absolute minimum. 
* **Emphasizing Compromise:** The message frames this counteroffer as a significant step taken by you, encouraging Bob to reciprocate with a more substantial counter.
* **Time Constraint:** As the rounds progress, it's a good strategy to increase the pressure slightly.  Mentioning your desire to close the deal can subtly nudge Bob to be more decisive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. To show I'm serious, I'll raise my offer to $1,250,000. This is a fair offer considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer is now at $1,250,000, which is better but still $250,000 less than your guaranteed sale with John. 
* **Leaving Money on the Table:** Accepting this offer would mean a significant loss compared to what you could earn from John. 
* **Negotiating Position:** You've established a pattern of reasonable counter-offers. Bob is clearly interested and has been steadily increasing his bids. You have a good chance of negotiating a better price in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you recognizing the value of this product and for continuing to negotiate. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  How about we settle at $1,450,000? This price reflects the true worth of what's being offered and allows us to close this deal today."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer is a carefully calculated move. It's a significant step towards Bob's latest offer, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate, but it keeps you well above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Sense of Urgency:** The message subtly introduces a sense of urgency by suggesting closing the deal ""today.""  This can encourage Bob to act decisively.
* **Firm but Fair:** The language maintains a firm stance on the product's value while expressing a genuine desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 

This offer aims to strike a balance between maximizing your profit and increasing the likelihood of closing the deal with Bob before he walks away or before you run out of rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  However, $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. How about $1,350,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acceptable Profit:** While not your ideal price, $1,350,000 is still a significant profit above your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Momentum:** Bob is clearly engaged and has made a substantial jump in his offer. Accepting now capitalizes on this positive momentum and avoids the risk of him lowering his offer or stalling the negotiations further. 
* **Time Factor:**  You're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds. Accepting now secures a very good deal rather than risking the uncertainty of the last few rounds.  

While you could potentially squeeze out a bit more, accepting this offer represents a smart balance of profit, risk mitigation, and efficient deal-making."
