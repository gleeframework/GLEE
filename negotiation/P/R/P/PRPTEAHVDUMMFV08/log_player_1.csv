{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $175.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value, hoping to get a good deal while still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $175 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm not willing to sell for less than $150. I'll counter his offer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $145? I think that's fair considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 145}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $145 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $130 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum value of $150.  While I'm open to negotiation, it's not worth risking further rounds to see if we can get to a better price.  John is offering my minimum, so I'll go ahead and sell to him."
