"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $1,500,000. It's a significant opportunity with great potential. Let's discuss this further."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

This offer starts high, knowing that I can always go lower.  It's a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play the negotiation game.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to pique his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product. However, I believe we can come to an agreement closer to my budget. I am willing to offer $1400000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I believe there's room for a higher price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000? This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering a counteroffer that's slightly higher than Bob's, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but also holding firm on the value I see in the product. This middle ground approach is a good strategy to encourage further negotiations without alienating Bob."
