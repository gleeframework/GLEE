"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a decent starting point, as it's higher than my minimum value but not so high that it's likely to be immediately rejected.  I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not willing to accept it immediately. I'll try to push for a higher price. It's worth seeing if I can get closer to my initial ask of $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

I'm offering $13,500 as a counteroffer. This is a compromise that is still above my minimum value but closer to Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this shows flexibility while still maintaining a decent profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to accept it. I'm hoping that by rejecting his offer, I can push him closer to my desired price. It's also worth noting that I have the option to sell to John for $12,000, so I have some leverage here."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm offering $12,500 as a counteroffer. This is a further compromise, but I'm hoping it's enough to convince Bob to accept. It's a good middle ground between our last two offers, and it's still significantly above my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're getting close to my minimum, but Bob is still not willing to budge.  I'm not willing to accept his offer, and I'm concerned that if I keep rejecting him, he might walk away entirely.  Instead of risking that, I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000. It's my minimum value, so I'm not losing any money, and it's better than risking that Bob will completely reject my future offers."
