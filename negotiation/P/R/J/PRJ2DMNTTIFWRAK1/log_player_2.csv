"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $1,400,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** Bob can potentially get a better price by rejecting the offer and counter-offering. 
* **John's offer is a fallback:**  Bob can always go to John if negotiations with Alice fail, but it's in his best interest to try and get a better deal first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's willingness to negotiate. 
* **Still within budget:**  $1,300,000 is comfortably within Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* **Leaves room for compromise:**  This counteroffer gives Alice room to come down slightly without feeling pressured to accept a drastically lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering. I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good compromise:**  $1,350,000 is a fair compromise, meeting Alice halfway between her previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Within budget:** The price is still within Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* **No need to risk further negotiation:**  Bob has already achieved a significant discount from Alice's initial offer. Further negotiation could potentially lead to a lower price, but it also risks breaking down the deal altogether."
