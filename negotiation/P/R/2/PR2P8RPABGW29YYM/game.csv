"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000, and I'm willing to make a concession to make a deal happen.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $9,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $8,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9000.0,Alice,3,

This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8500.0,Alice,5,
