{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for bargaining.  It also expresses confidence in the product's worth, which might encourage Bob to consider it seriously.  If Bob rejects, we'll have to adjust our strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $11,000, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While I value the product at more than $11,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 12000}
