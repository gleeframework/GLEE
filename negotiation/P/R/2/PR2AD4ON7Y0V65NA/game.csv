"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value this product holds, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,300,000 is still a little out of my range. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,275,000? This would allow me to move forward with the purchase while still giving you a healthy profit.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
