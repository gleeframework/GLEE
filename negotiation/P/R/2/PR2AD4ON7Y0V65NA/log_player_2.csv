# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present you with our premium product, which we believe would greatly benefit your business. Given its value to you, we are offering it at a special introductory price of $1,350,000. We are confident this price reflects the significant benefits and returns the product can provide for you. Looking forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. It is also likely that Alice is willing to go lower than $1,350,000 since the product is worth $1,200,000 to her.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value of the product to you, I propose a price of $1,300,000. This is a more reasonable midpoint between our previous offers, aiming to ensure both parties are satisfied with the transaction. I look forward to your consideration.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your budget, but it's getting closer. It's worth continuing to negotiate and try to get a lower price. You can still potentially get a better deal by making a counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,300,000 is still a little out of my range. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,275,000?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. In light of our ongoing discussion, I am pleased to offer the product at a price of $1,290,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,290,000 is within your budget and is a good compromise. It's only slightly higher than your last counteroffer and you're likely to get a better price than John's $1,500,000 offer.  Accepting this offer saves you $210,000 compared to buying from John."
