"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget.  It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  You have 10 rounds, so there's time to see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that's 20% lower than Alice's initial price.  This is a bold move, but I'm hoping it will make Alice realize that she needs to be more flexible to reach a deal.  It also leaves room for negotiation in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my maximum budget. I have several rounds left, and I want to see if I can push her lower. I'm also aware that I have the option of buying from John, so I'm not desperate to accept a price I'm uncomfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to make a counteroffer at my maximum budget. This is a risky move, but I believe it's my best chance to close the deal with Alice.  If she rejects, I can always buy from John for the same price."
