Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob sees value in the product and is willing to pay close to this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is my minimum value. While I could accept and sell to him, I'd prefer to see if I can get closer to my initial price. I'll reject his offer and try to counter with something closer to $200."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm counteroffering with $175. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows flexibility while still aiming for a higher price than Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Bob's offer of $160 is closer to my initial price and significantly higher than John's offer. I'll accept his offer and sell the product to Bob."
