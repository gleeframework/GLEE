I'm offering Alice $9,000 for the product. This is a significant discount from her initial offer and is still within my budget.  I hope she will be willing to negotiate."

I'm offering Alice $9,500 for the product. This is a compromise between her offer and my previous counteroffer.  Hopefully, we can find a middle ground."

Alice is not budging on her price. While $10,800 is still within my budget, I'd rather not risk further negotiation and lose more time. Buying from John for $10,000 is the best option to secure the product at a good price."
