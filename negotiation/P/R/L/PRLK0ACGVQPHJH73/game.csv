"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $60 is quite low for me. Could you meet me somewhere in the middle, say around $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $140 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about $75? That's a pretty big jump from my last offer.",75.0,Bob,4,
