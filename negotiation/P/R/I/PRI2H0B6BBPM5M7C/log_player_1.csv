Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer before I move to other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay more than your minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 creates a win-win situation if Bob accepts. He gets it for $50,000 less than its worth to him, and you make a $150,000 profit.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning other interested parties adds a touch of scarcity and encourages Bob to make a decision quickly. 

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob might reject the offer. However, this strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still making the offer attractive to Bob."
