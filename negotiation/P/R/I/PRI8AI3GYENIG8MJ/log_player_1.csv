Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $100 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $90. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $90, which is a good starting point. It's above my minimum ($80) and leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value he places on the product ($100) to emphasize the good deal I'm offering.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message is friendly and indicates I'm open to negotiation, which can help build rapport. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good price. 
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and negotiate accordingly, keeping in mind my minimum of $80 and John's offer of $80 as my fallback."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. I'm willing to pay that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to sell at $75 right away. Here's why:

* **Potential for Higher Price:** Bob is clearly interested, and I believe there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting his offer, I can potentially get him to pay closer to my original asking price.
* **John as Backup:**  Having John's offer of $80 provides a safety net. If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still sell the product for a decent price.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer, aiming for a price closer to $85 or $90. I'll use a similar approach as before, emphasizing the value he places on the product while still acknowledging his desire for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate you showing interest in the product! While $75 is a little lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $85. It's still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial offer, but still staying above my minimum of $80.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the $100 value he places on the product to emphasize the good deal I'm offering.
* **Positive Tone:** My message is friendly and encourages Bob to continue the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to carefully consider his next counteroffer. If he's unwilling to budge much, I might consider selling to John for $80 to avoid wasting further time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to pay $80 for the product. That's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's final offer is my minimum, but I'm choosing to sell to John for the same price. Here's why:

* **Time is Money:**  Negotiating further with Bob might lead to a slightly higher price, but it's unlikely to be significantly more. I don't want to risk wasting more time.
* **Certainty and Efficiency:**  Selling to John guarantees a quick and hassle-free transaction. There's no need to continue negotiating and potentially getting stuck in a stalemate with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'll proceed with the sale to John, knowing I've secured a fair price and avoided further negotiation with Bob."
