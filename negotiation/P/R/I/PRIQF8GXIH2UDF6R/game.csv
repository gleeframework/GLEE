"I'm not willing to go any lower than $17000, but I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a free warranty and maintenance package, which would normally cost $1500. This way, you'll get the product and some added value for the same price as my previous offer. I'm still willing to sell it to you for $17000",17000.0,Alice,5,
