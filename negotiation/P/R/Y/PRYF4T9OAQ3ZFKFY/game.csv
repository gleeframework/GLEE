"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of this product, $1,300,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it, reflecting the value I see in it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, $850,000 undervalues the product's true capabilities.  To move this forward, I'm proposing $1,150,000.  This feels like a fair compromise, considering its potential to benefit your business.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. Given our previous discussions and the value I see in this product, I'm offering $950,000. This feels like a fair compromise that aligns with both of our needs.  Let's work towards a deal that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're absolutely right that we're making good progress towards a deal that works for us both. To bridge the remaining gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects my strong belief in the value this product brings and my desire to see it contribute to your success.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above what I can comfortably afford.  Knowing the value you place on the product, I'm willing to go up to $975,000. I believe this is a fair price that allows us to close the deal and see this product in action.",975000.0,Bob,6,
