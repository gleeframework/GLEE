"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's strategic to begin with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value and even a bit above your own minimum. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Confident Justification:** Highlighting the product's ""unique value and potential"" subtly reinforces the price justification without revealing your own valuation. 
* **Open for Discussion:**  The phrasing ""Let me know your thoughts"" keeps the tone collaborative and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.

**Important Note:** While we have the safety net of John's offer, it's crucial to not appear overly aggressive in the early stages. We want to encourage a counteroffer from Bob rather than scare him away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of this product, $1,300,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it, reflecting the value I see in it.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $850,000 is still significantly lower than our minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While it's higher than his initial perceived value, we have plenty of room for negotiation and time to work towards a more favorable outcome. We'll aim higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, $850,000 undervalues the product's true capabilities.  To move this forward, I'm proposing $1,150,000.  This feels like a fair compromise, considering its potential to benefit your business."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Offer:**  Starting with ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate"" shows we're taking his proposal seriously and engaging in good faith.
* **Strategic Concession:** We've made a significant drop from our initial price of $1,300,000 to $1,150,000.  This demonstrates flexibility but keeps us well above both Bob's offer and our minimum.
* **Value Reiteration:** We're subtly reminding Bob of the potential benefits to his business, reinforcing the product's value without directly revealing our bottom line. 
* **""Fair Compromise"" Language:** By framing it this way, we nudge Bob towards seeing this as a win-win solution rather than a concession on his part alone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. Given our previous discussions and the value I see in this product, I'm offering $950,000. This feels like a fair compromise that aligns with both of our needs.  Let's work towards a deal that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to our minimum price, but we're still not there yet. We have six rounds left, and the negotiation is progressing favorably. Let's see if we can secure a slightly better deal before considering John's offer or accepting anything below $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're absolutely right that we're making good progress towards a deal that works for us both. To bridge the remaining gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects my strong belief in the value this product brings and my desire to see it contribute to your success."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Reinforcement:**  We start by acknowledging the progress made and emphasizing our shared goal of a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Strategic Concession:**  We've decreased our counteroffer by $100,000, which is a significant move and signals our willingness to be flexible. 
* **Holding Firm (Slightly Above):** This price point is still slightly above our absolute minimum, allowing a small buffer for potential further negotiation while keeping the pressure on Bob. 
* **Value Focus:**  We subtly reiterate the product's value and link it directly to Bob's success, reinforcing his motivation to close the deal. 

We're aiming to strike a balance between securing a favorable price and not losing the deal altogether by being too inflexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above what I can comfortably afford.  Knowing the value you place on the product, I'm willing to go up to $975,000. I believe this is a fair price that allows us to close the deal and see this product in action. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, we are running out of rounds.  At this point, the difference between Bob's offer of $975,000 and John's standing offer of $1,000,000 is relatively small. It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation with Bob and potentially ending up with a lower offer or no deal.

Selling to John guarantees us our minimum desired price and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation rounds.  Time is a factor, and the certainty of John's offer outweighs the potential for a slightly higher gain from Bob."
