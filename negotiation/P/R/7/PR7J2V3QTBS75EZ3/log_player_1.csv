I'm offering the product to Bob for $9,500. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum price of $8,000 but leaves some room for negotiation.  I want to maximize my profit, but also want to avoid losing the sale to John."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:

I'm offering the product to Bob for $9,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's current offer. I'm hoping this will be a sweet spot for both of us and we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
