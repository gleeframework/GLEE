"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you our amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $150. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We can definitely negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for showing me the product, Alice. I'm interested, but $150 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're aiming to pay much less than Alice's initial offer. A low counter-offer establishes a negotiation space and gives us room to move upwards.
* **Polite and Interested:**  While our offer is significantly lower, we want to maintain a positive tone and show Alice we are serious about purchasing the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $150 might be a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $125. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice came down in price, $125 is still above our $120 limit. We know John offers the product at that price, so we have a strong alternative.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice seems open to negotiation. By rejecting this offer, we signal that we're looking for a more substantial price reduction."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. I'm still very interested in the product, but I have a strict budget of $100. Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** We're moving closer to Alice's price but still significantly below her last offer. This shows we're willing to negotiate but holding firm on our desired price range.
* **Budget Mention:**  By mentioning a ""strict budget,"" we create a sense of urgency and a valid reason for not meeting Alice's previous price.
* **Maintaining Interest:** We continue to express interest in the product to encourage Alice to continue negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $100 is a tight budget for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $115. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but Not There:** Alice is getting closer to our ideal price, but $115 is still above our $120 backup option with John.
* **Final Push:**  We've been consistent in our negotiation, and Alice has indicated this is her lowest. We'll make one final push for our target price, knowing we can go to John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $115 is very tempting, but I can't go any higher than $105. If that works, I'm ready to make this purchase today."",
""product_price"": 105
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** We're presenting this as our best and final offer to create a sense of urgency. 
* **Attractive Price:** $105 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and a reasonable price point for both parties.
* **Ready to Buy:** By stating our intent to purchase immediately, we signal that we're serious and this is Alice's last chance to make the sale before we consider alternatives."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I can offer it to you for $110. This is my final concession. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll make the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** Alice has come down considerably and $110 is a good price, saving us $10 compared to John's offer.
* **Final Offer:**  Alice has signaled this is her absolute bottom line. Pushing further might lead to us losing the deal.
* **Time Invested:** We've already spent considerable time in this negotiation. Accepting now avoids potentially missing out on the product entirely."
