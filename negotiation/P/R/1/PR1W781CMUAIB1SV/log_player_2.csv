This price takes into account both the value you see in the product and our need to ensure a reasonable return on our investment.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is still unwilling to come down significantly in price.  Bob is getting closer to his limit, and while another round of negotiation is possible, it's likely that Alice won't budge much further.  Since John is offering the product for $1,000,000, it's now the best option for Bob to avoid potentially further rounds of negotiations with Alice and a higher price."
