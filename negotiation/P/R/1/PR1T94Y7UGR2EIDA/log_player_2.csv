"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,250,000. This represents a significant value for you, as you've indicated an interest in acquiring it for $1,000,000. I believe this price allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  Please consider this offer carefully, as I have a backup buyer who is willing to pay the full value of $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than her backup buyer's price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. By rejecting the offer, Bob can secure the product from John for $1,000,000, which is his desired price point."
