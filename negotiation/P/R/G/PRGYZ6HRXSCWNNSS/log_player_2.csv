"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget of $80.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $110 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product but would be willing to pay $85.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still gives her some room to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $95? I'm confident you'll find this product worth it at that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum.  You can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in the product but $95 is still a bit too high.  How about $90? That would be a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is another step closer to Alice's price, showing a willingness to negotiate. It's still within your budget and could potentially be accepted."
