"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is around $10,000. Would you be willing to come down to $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm ready to close the deal if we can meet in the middle at $13,000. ",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're close to making a decision, but I'm not ready to give up just yet. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $13,500. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
