"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not quite comfortable with $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I can offer it to you for $105. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",105.0,Alice,3,,

"I understand you're firm on the price, Alice, but I'm on a bit of a budget.  Could we make it $97? That's a fair compromise, I think.",97.0,Bob,4,,

"I'm glad you're willing to make a compromise, Bob, but I'm still a bit above $97. I can offer it to you for $102, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",102.0,Alice,5,,
