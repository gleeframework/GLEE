Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth $1,200,000 to me. Selling to John guarantees that amount. While Bob's offer is closer to what he's willing to pay, I can still negotiate for a better price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, considering the value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. Can we meet in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a higher price, even though Bob is firm on his $1,050,000 offer. I'm willing to negotiate further but I'm not going to settle for a price that's significantly lower than what the product is worth to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective.  I'm willing to go down to $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise, and it's still significantly higher than your initial offer. I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,075,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,025,000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not ready to settle. I've got rounds to spare, and John is still a viable option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,025,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my need to make a profit. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,020,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be careful with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've been negotiating with Bob for several rounds and we're not making much progress. His offers are getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still not comfortable with them. With only two rounds left, I don't have time to continue haggling. Selling to John guarantees me the full $1,200,000, so that's the better option at this point."
