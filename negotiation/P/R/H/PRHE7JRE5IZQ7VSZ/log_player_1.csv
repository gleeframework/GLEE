Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm happy to answer any questions you may have."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible without losing the sale.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $11,500 leaves some wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate a slightly lower price. 
* **Strong Alternative:** We have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 to John, so we don't need to drastically undersell to Bob. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible profit while still making the offer attractive to Bob."
