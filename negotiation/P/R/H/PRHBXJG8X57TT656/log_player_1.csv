{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I know the product is worth $10,000 to both of us, starting at $14,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  It's unlikely Bob will accept the first offer. This high price anchors the negotiation and allows me to potentially come down a bit while still staying above my minimum. 
* **Backup plan:** I have the security of John's offer. If Bob refuses, I'm not losing out. This knowledge empowers me to aim higher with Bob. 
 
**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. I, as Alice, am prepared to negotiate with Bob based on his response and potentially lower the price to secure the deal, but always aiming to stay above my $10,000 minimum."
