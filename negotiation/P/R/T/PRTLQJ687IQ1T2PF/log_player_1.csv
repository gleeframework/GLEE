I'll reject Bob's offer.  $12,000 is too low, and I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price."

While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, $14,000 is a reasonable offer and only $1,000 less than what John would pay. It's getting late in the game, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether."
