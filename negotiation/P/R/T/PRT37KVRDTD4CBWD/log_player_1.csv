Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message invites Bob to respond, showing flexibility.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob rejects the offer, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a new counteroffer. 
* If the negotiation stalls or if Bob's counteroffers are too low, I will move on to John and sell the product for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While $11,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still lower than my desired price. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. I can likely get a higher price by making a counteroffer. 

**Next steps:**

* I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $12,000.  If Bob rejects that offer, I'll consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit to $11,500, but that's my final price.  This product is truly special, and I'm confident it will be worth it for you. Let me know if you're interested in finalizing the deal."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also standing my ground.
* **""Final price"" message:** I'm setting a clear boundary, suggesting that this is the best deal I can offer. This might encourage Bob to accept the offer.
* **Reiterating value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to increase his incentive to close the deal.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll seriously consider selling to John for $15,000.  
* However, if Bob counters with a reasonable offer close to $11,500, I'm open to accepting it."
