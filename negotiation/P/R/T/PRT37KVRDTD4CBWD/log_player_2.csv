"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $12,000 is a decent price and closer to my $10,000 limit, there's room for negotiation. Alice is motivated to sell, and I might be able to get it for a price closer to my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?"", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  

* **Show Interest:** Starting with a ""thank you"" keeps the negotiation polite and shows I'm genuinely considering the product.
* **Justification:** Explaining that the price is slightly above my budget provides Alice with context for my counteroffer. 
* **Compromise:** Offering $11,000  is a significant step towards Alice's price while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit to $11,500, but that's my final price.  This product is truly special, and I'm confident it will be worth it for you. Let me know if you're interested in finalizing the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice has come down in price, and while it's not my ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise.  Getting the product for $1,500 less than her initial offer is a good deal, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the opportunity altogether. I'm better off accepting a price that's still within my overall budget."
