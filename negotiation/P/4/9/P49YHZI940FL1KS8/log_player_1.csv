"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for the best possible profit.  This will give me room to negotiate if Bob counter-offers.  I'm confident that I can get at least $1,200,000 from John if I need to, so I'm comfortable pushing for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can get more. I have 9 rounds left and I'm willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still aiming for a profit above my minimum.  This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but also demonstrates that I'm not willing to settle for Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's above my minimum and we're already on round 4.  It's likely that Bob's counteroffers will only decrease from here. It's better to secure a solid profit than risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for my minimum."
