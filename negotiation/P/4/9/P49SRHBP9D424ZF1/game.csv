"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is too high for me. I'm very interested in the product but I can't go above $1,000,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the product's value significantly exceeds that figure, and my original asking price reflects its true worth. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $1,450,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This represents a substantial increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price.  Let's find a way to bridge this gap. To demonstrate my commitment to getting this deal done, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  I believe this offer represents a fair compromise for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,300,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably pay.  I'm willing to go to $1,200,000.  This would be a significant compromise for me, and I truly believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
