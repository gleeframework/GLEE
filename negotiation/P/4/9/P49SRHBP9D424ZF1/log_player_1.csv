"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a price higher than your desired outcome. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Confident Tone:**  Projecting confidence in the product's value can influence Bob's perception. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message explicitly mentions finding a ""mutually beneficial agreement,"" signaling to Bob that you're willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is too high for me. I'm very interested in the product but I can't go above $1,000,000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is his absolute maximum, but significantly below your minimum. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. While selling to John is an option, we still have negotiating room and time before resorting to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the product's value significantly exceeds that figure, and my original asking price reflects its true worth. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge and Moderate:** We acknowledge Bob's offer but firmly reiterate that it's far too low. 
* **Strategic Compromise:**  We make a substantial decrease from our initial offer, but not so much that it undermines the product's perceived value. 
* **Justification:**  We emphasize this is a significant concession, subtly putting the onus back on Bob to make a move closer to our range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $1,450,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This represents a substantial increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is inching closer, but we're still significantly below our walk-away price. We need to signal that we're willing to negotiate, but not at the cost of a significant loss. Rejecting keeps the door open for further negotiation while keeping the option to sell to John open if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price.  Let's find a way to bridge this gap. To demonstrate my commitment to getting this deal done, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  I believe this offer represents a fair compromise for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Tone:**  We maintain a collaborative and positive tone to encourage Bob's engagement.
* **Significant Movement:** We drop a full $150,000, a substantial amount that signals our willingness to negotiate seriously.
* **""Fair Compromise"" Framing:**  We position this offer as a balanced solution where both parties are making concessions. 
* **Urgency (Implicit):**  While not explicitly stated, the size of this counteroffer subtly hints that we're getting closer to our bottom line."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,300,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably pay.  I'm willing to go to $1,200,000.  This would be a significant compromise for me, and I truly believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now met our minimum acceptable price. While we could try to push for slightly more, it's unlikely we'll see a significant increase from this point, and we risk alienating Bob entirely. Accepting ensures a successful and profitable deal."
