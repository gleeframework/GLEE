Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer. I can still do better than $1,200,000. I need to push for a higher price to maximize my profit."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $1,200,000 simply isn't enough for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,300,000. How about $1,250,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, $1,250,000 is still a good deal for me.  It's above my minimum, and it's worth the risk of losing a sale if I continue to negotiate.  It's better to secure a profit now than risk getting nothing."
