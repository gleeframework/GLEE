"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to you.  I'm offering it to you for $100. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Alice's starting offer is too high. There's plenty of room for negotiation before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""That's a bit steep for me, Alice. I'm interested, but I could only do it for $85."", 
""product_price"": 85
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We begin with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still above her valuation. This leaves room for negotiation while signaling our budget constraints.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message maintains a friendly tone but clearly indicates the offer is too high. We provide a specific counteroffer to demonstrate seriousness. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer allows us to gauge Alice's flexibility and potentially secure a highly favorable deal. Even if she rejects it, we have space to negotiate upwards before reaching John's $120 offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 is still a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is negotiating, but we can still do better. Splitting the difference on our initial offers heavily favors her.  We're aiming for a price closer to $80, so we need to push back further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $88? That's a significant jump from my initial offer."", 
""product_price"": 88
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Shifting Negotiation:**  We acknowledge Alice's desire for a fair price but stand firm on getting a better deal. We're moving closer to her price, but in smaller increments.
* **Highlighting Concessions:** By pointing out our significant jump from $85, we emphasize our willingness to compromise and encourage Alice to do the same. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer keeps us in a strong position. We're still below $90, leaving room to negotiate slightly upwards while staying well below John's offer."
