"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,400,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,000,000 is lower than my expectations, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This price still reflects the product's value, and it's a good starting point for reaching an agreement. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,200,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession and offer the product for $1,150,000. This is the absolute lowest I can go, and it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product. I'm confident that this deal will be mutually beneficial.  Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
