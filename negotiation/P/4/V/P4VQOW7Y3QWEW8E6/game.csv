"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. However, I'm hoping to get the product for a bit less. Would you be willing to go down to $13500? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",13500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $13800. This is a great compromise, considering the value the product will bring to your business.",13800.0,Alice,3,
