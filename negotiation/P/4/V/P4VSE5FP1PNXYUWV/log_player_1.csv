"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

Round 3

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your confidence in the product's value, but I still think $750,000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

}

**Reasoning:**

While continuing to negotiate with Bob might yield a slightly higher price, it's becoming clear he's unlikely to meet our minimum acceptable price of $800,000. We have a guaranteed offer from John for our minimum, and it makes sense to take the sure thing at this point rather than risk further negotiation with Bob."
