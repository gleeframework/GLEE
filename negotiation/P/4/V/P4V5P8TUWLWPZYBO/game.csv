"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $95 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to do $85?  ",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $85 is a bit lower than I'm hoping to get for this product, but I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $90? This would still be a good deal for you as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $90. How about we meet in the middle at $87.50? That's a fair price for both of us.",87.5,Bob,4,
