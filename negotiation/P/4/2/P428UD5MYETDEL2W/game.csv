"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below the product's value. I'm prepared to drop my price slightly to $1,600,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still willing to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too low.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,550,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows both of us to come away satisfied.",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer.  $1,450,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for something a bit more. How about we settle on $1,500,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal.",1500000.0,Alice,7,
