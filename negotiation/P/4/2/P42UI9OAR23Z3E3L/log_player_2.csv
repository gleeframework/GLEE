"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

It's not worth buying the product from Alice for $150 when you can get it from John for $120. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

I'm offering Alice $110 for the product. This is still below my maximum price of $120, and it's a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Alice's offer is still too high. I'll reject it and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm raising my offer slightly to $115, showing Alice I'm serious about buying the product, but still staying below my maximum."

Alice is coming down in price, but it's still not worth it for me to buy from her yet. I'll continue negotiating."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm offering Alice my maximum price of $120. This is a fair offer considering I can get the product from John for the same price. Hopefully, Alice will accept."
