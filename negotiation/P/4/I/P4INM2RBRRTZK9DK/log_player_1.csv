"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm starting with a slightly higher price than the product's worth to me, hoping to get as much as possible.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $75 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum price of $80. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm offering a price slightly lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's. I'm hoping to strike a deal that's fair for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my minimum price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll counteroffer again, but if he rejects it, I might consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 82}
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly to $82.  I'm hoping this will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, but I'm also getting closer to my minimum price, so I'm starting to feel the pressure."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is my minimum price, and I'm happy to sell the product to Bob for $80.  It's a good outcome, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate."
