"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can do better.  The product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so there's room to negotiate.  By rejecting, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm happy to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, but I still think the product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $9000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

``` 
Alice's offer of $9,000 is still better than buying from John for $10,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject and he'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer guarantees a good deal."
