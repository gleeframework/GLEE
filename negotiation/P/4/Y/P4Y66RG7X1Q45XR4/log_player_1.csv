"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000.  This is a good starting point as it's a significant discount from what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still allows me to make a good profit. I'm also using a friendly and encouraging tone in my message."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested, but $10,000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my minimum price, I believe I can still do better. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. $9,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  How about $9,500?  I'm willing to work with you to get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm countering with $9,500. This is still a good profit for me, but it's a compromise from my initial offer and shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm also maintaining a positive and encouraging tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really want to work with you on this, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $9,250 is a good price, I think I can still get a little closer to my target. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. Let's meet in the middle at $9,375. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 9375}
```

I'm offering $9,375, which is closer to Bob's last offer.  This shows him I'm serious about reaching a deal. I'm also emphasizing fairness and the potential for closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my target price.  Would you consider $9,250?  I'm confident this is a fair deal for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  It's only slightly less than my last counteroffer, and I'm getting close to the end of our negotiation rounds. It's a good deal for me, and I want to close the deal before I run out of time or risk having to sell to John for a lower price."
