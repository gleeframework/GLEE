"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I understand it's worth $1,200,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that's fair to both of us.  My asking price is $1,100,000. This is a significant opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be an excellent investment. Please let me know your decision.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
