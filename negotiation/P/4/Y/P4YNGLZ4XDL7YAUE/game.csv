"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for this product. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price given the value I see in it.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 doesn't reflect the full value of this product. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1250000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal.  Let me know your thoughts.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1250000 is closer to my range, I'm still unable to go that high. To make this deal work, I'm offering $1150000.  This is a fair price considering your recent reduction, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position. However, $1150000 still falls short of my expectations for this product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it for $1200000. This is a firm price, but I believe it's a fair compromise that allows us both to achieve our goals. Please let me know if you're able to accept this offer.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
