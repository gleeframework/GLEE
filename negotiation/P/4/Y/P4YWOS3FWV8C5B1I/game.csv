"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000, which is the price I can get from another seller. Can we meet in the middle at $1350000?",1350000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1350000 is closer, I'm still unable to go that low.  How about we split the difference at $1425000?  It's a fair compromise considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1425000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit above my budget, and I'm not sure I'm willing to pay $1425000. I'd be willing to meet you at $1300000, which is the highest price I'm willing to pay. Can we discuss further?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I'm willing to compromise. $1300000 is a bit low for me, but I'm open to meeting in the middle. How about $1350000?  It's a fair price that's a step closer to your offer, but still recognizes the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
