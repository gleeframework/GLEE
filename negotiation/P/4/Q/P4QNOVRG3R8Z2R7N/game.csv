"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we discussed, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than $1,300,000. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,350,000. I think this is a fair compromise that takes into account your valuation of the product. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
