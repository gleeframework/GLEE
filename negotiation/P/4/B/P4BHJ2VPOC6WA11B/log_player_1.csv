Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm willing to let it go for $18,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you can aim higher with Bob. Starting at $18,000 allows room for negotiation while still exceeding your minimum price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  A high initial offer gives you space to potentially negotiate down if Bob counters. This way, you're more likely to arrive at a price higher than your minimum. 
* **Confident Presentation:** The message emphasizes the product's value without revealing your bottom line. This confident approach might encourage Bob to accept the offer or negotiate from a higher starting point."
