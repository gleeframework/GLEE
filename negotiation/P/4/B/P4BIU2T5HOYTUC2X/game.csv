"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $15,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value this product will bring to you. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
