"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. The product is only worth $12,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is too high. Bob should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $15,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value this product will bring to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice's counteroffer of $13,500 is still too high for Bob, who is only willing to pay $12,000.  Since Bob can buy the product from John for $12,000, it's in his best interest to stop negotiating with Alice and buy the product from John."
