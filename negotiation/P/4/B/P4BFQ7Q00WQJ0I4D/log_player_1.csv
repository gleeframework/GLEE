I've gone back and forth with Bob several times, and it seems we're not going to reach an agreement that's satisfactory for both of us.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $800,000.  It's not my ideal price, but it's better than continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially getting a lower offer."
