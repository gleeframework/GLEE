"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000.",11000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can go that high.  How about $10,500?  That's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Bob. However, I have to consider my minimum price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. How about $11,250? It's a compromise that I think we can both live with.",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $11,250 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and try $10,875. I think that's a fair price that reflects both our needs.",10875.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,875. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to stay above $11,000. How about $11,375? It's a bit more than my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price for both of us.",11375.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm committed to finding a deal, but $11,375 is still a bit steep for me.  Let's try $11,125.  It's a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's the best way to reach an agreement.",11125.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to stay above $11,125. How about $11,250? It's a small increase, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. I'm willing to go up to $11,187.50. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial deal.",11187.5,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $11,187.50, Bob. However, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about $11,250? It's a small increase, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11250.0,Alice,9,
