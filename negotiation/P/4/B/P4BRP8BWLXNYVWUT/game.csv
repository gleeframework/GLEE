"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm open to negotiations and willing to work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While I acknowledge your perspective on the product's value, $900000 doesn't quite meet my expectations.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This price still allows for a healthy profit for me while offering you a good deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $1000000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. I'm open to further negotiations if needed.",950000.0,Bob,4,
