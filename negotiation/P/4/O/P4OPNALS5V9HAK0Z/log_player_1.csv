Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $99. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 99
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as much money as possible. Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $99 is just below your guaranteed price and significantly above Bob's perceived value ($80). This gives Bob the illusion of a deal while maximizing your potential profit. 
* **Simple and Direct:** The message is clear and concise, focusing on the offer itself. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $99. He might try to negotiate, or he might outright reject the offer. However, this approach gives you the best chance of exceeding your minimum selling price."
