Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $140.  This leaves room for negotiation, but still gets me a decent profit above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $130 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counter with $135. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but still a good price for me.  Hopefully, Bob will see the value in my product and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While $128 is closer to my minimum, it's still a good profit and I'm not sure I can get any better with a counteroffer.  It's always possible Bob will walk away, and I don't want to risk losing the sale completely."
