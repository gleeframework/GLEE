Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your expertise, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit maximization.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product to Bob at $1,400,000 presents a substantial gain for Alice compared to Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, the message leaves a small window open for Bob to counter-offer, potentially pushing the price closer to $1,500,000. 
* **Confident Tone:** The message emphasizes the product's value and Alice's belief in its worth, subtly influencing Bob's perception.

This strategy prioritizes maximizing profit while maintaining a balance between attractiveness to Bob and securing a guaranteed sale."
