"I appreciate the offer, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be reasonable. I'm thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us.  While $900,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a significant reduction, and I believe it reflects the true value of this product.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a bit rich for my blood. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose $1,025,000. This is a fair price, considering the value I've seen in similar products.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. It seems we are getting closer.  How about $1,087,500? This splits the difference and represents a final offer from my side.",1087500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm confident we can meet on this price.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
