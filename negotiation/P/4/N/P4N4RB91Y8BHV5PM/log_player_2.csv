"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I will reject Alice's offer because I can get the product from John for $150, which is more than Alice's offer of $140, but still within my budget. However, I can also try to negotiate with Alice to see if she can lower the price. If she can offer me a price lower than $140, I would consider accepting her offer.
