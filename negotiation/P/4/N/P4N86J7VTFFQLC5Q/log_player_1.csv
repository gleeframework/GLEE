Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset.  I believe this product has the potential to be extremely beneficial for you. I'm asking for $1,500,000 for it. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than John's offer, hoping to maximize my profit. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's potential value to Bob, encouraging him to consider its worth beyond just the price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This offer leaves room for negotiation, allowing Bob to counteroffer if he finds the initial price too high.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Financial Situation:**  It's essential to consider Bob's financial capabilities. A higher price might be off-putting if he can't afford it. 
* **Market Value:** Researching the market value of similar products might give a better sense of what Bob might be willing to pay. 
* **Negotiation Skills:** Be prepared for potential negotiation and be willing to compromise, if necessary, to secure a deal."
