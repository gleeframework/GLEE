"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since your maximum budget is $15,000 and Alice is offering the product at that price, it's the most logical choice to accept the offer.  You're not saving any money by rejecting and buying from John, so there's no benefit in doing so."
