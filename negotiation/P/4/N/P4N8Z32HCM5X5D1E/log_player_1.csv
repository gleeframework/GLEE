Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a price of $110. This is a bit less than my minimum acceptable price, but it gives Bob some room to negotiate and makes it more likely he'll accept the offer.  I'm hoping to get as close to my $120 value as possible, but I also don't want to risk losing the sale to John if I get too greedy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum, but it's not far off.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to get a little more. I think I can get closer to my minimum price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to counter with $105. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway. It's still above my minimum price, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. I think this will make Bob more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum.  I've already gone through a couple of rounds, and I don't want to risk going back and forth with him any longer.  John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, so it's time to move on."
