,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $100?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can do $105. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $105 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you consider that price?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $102.50. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",102.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $102.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $98 for the product. I'm really interested in buying it from you, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider that price?",98.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $98 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $100.50. It's the final offer I can make, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",100.5,Alice,7,
