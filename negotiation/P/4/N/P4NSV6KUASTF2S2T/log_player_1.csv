"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the significant return on investment you'll see."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with an offer higher than your desired outcome. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value"" and ""potential,"" you anchor the price to the product's benefits, not just its cost.
* **Leaving Room:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, aiming higher with Bob could lead to a more profitable outcome. This initial offer leaves space to negotiate downwards while staying well above your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your perspective on the product's value. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the initial asking price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a significant improvement, it's still below my target. I believe there's room for negotiation.  I'll counter in the next round to try and reach a more favorable price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, however, the value this product brings is truly unique. I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting the product's worth while acknowledging your perspective."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm lowering my price by $200,000, showing willingness to negotiate while still aiming higher than Bob's offer.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's benefits to justify the higher price. 
* **Finding Middle Ground:** This counteroffer aims to find a compromise between my initial ask and Bob's counteroffer. It keeps the negotiation moving while still targeting a price point significantly above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I value your willingness to negotiate. Based on my assessment and financial considerations, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,950,000. I hope this proposal is within your range and allows us to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to the $2 million mark, which would be a significant gain compared to John's offer. However, with patience, I believe I can still push for a slightly higher price in the next few rounds. The negotiation momentum is in our favor."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly recognizing the inherent value here.  Let's find a path forward. How about we settle at $2,050,000? This reflects the significant advantages you'll gain while acknowledging your position."",
""product_price"": 2050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** I'm reducing my counteroffer by $50,000, signaling I'm getting closer to my bottom line while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Positive Language:** Phrases like ""finding a path forward"" and ""acknowledging your position"" promote collaboration and a sense of progress.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer splits the difference between our last two positions, encouraging Bob to make a similar move towards a final agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your continued flexibility. I appreciate your efforts to find common ground. Based on my financial situation, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $2,000,000. I believe this price is reasonable for both parties involved. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has reached a price point that represents a significant profit margin over John's standing offer. While I might be able to squeeze out a bit more, the risk of Bob walking away and the diminishing returns suggest that accepting $2,000,000 is the most strategically sound decision at this point."
