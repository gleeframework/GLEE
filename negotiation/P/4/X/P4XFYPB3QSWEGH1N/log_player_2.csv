"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

While Alice's offer of $140 is tempting, you know John will sell you the product for $120.  You're better off rejecting Alice's offer and saving the extra $20."
