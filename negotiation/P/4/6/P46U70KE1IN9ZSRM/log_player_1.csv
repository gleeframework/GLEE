Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price to leave room for bargaining. 
* **Understanding Value:** You know Bob values the product at $800,000 and you won't sell for less than $1,200,000.  Starting at $1,100,000 leaves space for negotiation while still being significantly above Bob's perceived value.
* **Alternative Option:** You have the security of John's offer ($1,200,000) if negotiations with Bob don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. This is my best offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum price ($1,200,000) and your initial offer. While his message hints at some flexibility, there's a significant gap to bridge. You have leverage knowing John offers your minimum acceptable price. Rejecting this offer signals you're serious about a higher valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, the value of this product is considerably higher than your proposed price. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a firm offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm Stance:**  Using language like ""firm offer"" emphasizes you're serious about the price.
* **Strategic Concession:**  You're making a smaller concession this round ($50,000 vs. $200,000), signaling you're not desperate to make a deal at any price.
* **Middle Ground?:** This offer explores whether Bob is willing to move significantly from his initial offer. If he's not, you have a good alternative with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I still think $900,000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll increase my offer to $950,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiation:** Bob increased his offer by only $50,000, the same amount you decreased yours in the previous round. This suggests he's unwilling to move significantly towards your valuation.
* **Final Offer:** Bob stating this is his ""final offer"" limits further negotiation potential.
* **Guaranteed Value:** You have a guaranteed offer from John at your minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000).  Continuing with Bob carries risk with little potential upside.

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Bob. Accepting John's offer ensures you receive your desired value for the product."
