"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I recognize the value of the product, $2,000,000 is significantly beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for it, which still leaves a reasonable profit margin for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $2,000,000 reflects the true value of this product, I understand your position.  How about we meet halfway at $1,600,000? This offer stands as a testament to my desire to see this deal through.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and settle on $1,400,000. This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to finalize this deal.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
