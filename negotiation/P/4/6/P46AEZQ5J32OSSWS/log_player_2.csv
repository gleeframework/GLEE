"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $2,000,000 is far above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's in your best interest to reject the offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $2,000,000 reflects the true value of this product, I understand your position.  How about we meet halfway at $1,600,000? This offer stands as a testament to my desire to see this deal through.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my maximum budget. I'm willing to keep negotiating, aiming for a price closer to my target of $1,000,000. There's still room for compromise, and I want to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
