"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $119. I believe you'll find great value in it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  You're getting the product for $119 from Alice, saving $1 compared to buying it from John for $120. 
* **You're still getting a good deal.**  You value the product at $120 and are getting it for less."
