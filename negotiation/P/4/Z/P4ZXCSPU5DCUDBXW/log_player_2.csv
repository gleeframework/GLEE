"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and the benefits it provides, I propose a price of $120 for this item. I understand its worth to you might be higher, but I hope this offer aligns with your budget while ensuring a fair transaction for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $120 is still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $150. By rejecting this offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice or proceed to buy from John for $150."
