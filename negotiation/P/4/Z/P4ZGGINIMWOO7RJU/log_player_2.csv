"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $150 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $140.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. There's room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly lower offer ($100) allows room for negotiation while staying well below my $150 maximum. This strategy aims to test Alice's flexibility and potentially secure a highly favorable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more to $125. This is a fair price considering the value to you. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming closer to a reasonable price, but we can still negotiate. Her offer is now closer to her value than mine. By rejecting and countering, we signal willingness to walk away and potentially incentivize a better offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I see where you're coming from, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $115?"",
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We're getting into the final stages of negotiation. Offering $115 is a fair compromise, splitting the difference between her previous offer ($125) and my last counteroffer ($100). This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price that's significantly below my $150 maximum and closer to her perceived value."
