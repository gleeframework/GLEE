Round 3

Round 4

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm going to reject and try to push for a higher price.  John is a backup option, but I'm hoping to get closer to my target price with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still not quite there.  $775,000 is a fair compromise, but I'm looking for a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This still leaves you with a good deal, and it's closer to what I need. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 825000}

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price. It's a good deal for both of us and I'd rather close the deal with Bob than sell to John at the same price."
