"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $700,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This still gives you a great opportunity, and it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm still not quite there.  $775,000 is a fair compromise, but I'm looking for a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This still leaves you with a good deal, and it's closer to what I need. Let's make this happen.",825000.0,Alice,5,
