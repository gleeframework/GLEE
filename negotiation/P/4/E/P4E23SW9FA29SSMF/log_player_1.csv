"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000} 
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a price that's more than what the product is worth to Bob but less than what it's worth to me. This leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob an incentive to try and reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price, but it's closer than my initial offer. I'm going to reject it for now and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit more, but still keeping it above my minimum. This shows Bob I'm serious about making a deal, but also that I'm not willing to settle for a price that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject it again and try to push for a higher price.  It's still early in the negotiation, and I have several rounds left to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm reducing my price again, but I'm still holding firm above my minimum. I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to compromise, but I also need to ensure I get a price that reflects the value of the product to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're approaching the halfway point of the negotiations, and Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not confident that we can reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds. To secure a price that meets my needs, I'm going to sell the product to John."
