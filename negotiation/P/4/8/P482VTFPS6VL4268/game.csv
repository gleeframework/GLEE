"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. However, that price is quite high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,100,000 is still too high for my budget. I can do $700,000. I think that's a fair offer.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the gap between our valuations is still quite large. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $950,000.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000 to meet you closer to the middle.",750000.0,Bob,6,
