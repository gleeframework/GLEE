"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a valuable asset that I believe will be of significant interest to you. I'm asking for $1500000 for it. This price reflects the unique value and potential of this product. I'm confident that you'll see the same value I do. Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've described, and I'm willing to negotiate further if needed.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While I value your perspective, $900000 doesn't quite reflect the full potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1200000 to bridge the gap. This price is still a great deal considering the value I know this product can deliver. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $1200000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1000000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've described, and I'm willing to negotiate further if needed.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
