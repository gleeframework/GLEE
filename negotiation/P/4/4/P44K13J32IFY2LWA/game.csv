"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $1500000.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to negotiate further if necessary.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1100000. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $1100000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950000. I'm willing to compromise and find a mutually beneficial price, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1050000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering its value to me.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
