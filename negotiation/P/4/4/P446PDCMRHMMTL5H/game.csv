"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe is of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $145. It's a fair price considering its worth to me and the potential benefit it can bring to you. Let me know what you think!",145.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $145 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100? I believe that's a fair price that reflects its value to me.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $100 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I get a reasonable price. How about $125? That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a fair return on my investment.",125.0,Alice,3,
