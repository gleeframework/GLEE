{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its worth and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefit you'll gain from it."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $800,000 (your guaranteed sale to John). 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Aiming slightly below Bob's valuation gives you room to negotiate while still exceeding your minimum.  A price of $925,000 leaves Bob with a potential $75,000 gain, making it likely he'll accept.

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, this strategy balances risk with the potential for a significantly higher profit than your guaranteed sale."
