"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. It's something that I'm confident you'll find highly beneficial. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,000,000. This is a one-time opportunity, and I'm confident you won't regret it. Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Since John is willing to sell the product for the same price ($1,000,000), there is no benefit to accepting Alice's offer. It's better to keep the option open to potentially negotiate with Alice later or see if another seller emerges with a better price."
