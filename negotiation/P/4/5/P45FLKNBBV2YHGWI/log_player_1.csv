Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. I'm confident this is a price we can both be happy with.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've chosen a price that is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000 but still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate but also ensures I get a good return.
* **Message:** I've included a message that highlights the value proposition for Bob, while also expressing confidence in a mutually beneficial outcome. This is to encourage him to consider the offer seriously. 

**Remember:**  This is just an opening offer. I'll be ready to adjust based on Bob's response and the potential need to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I have a budget constraint and need to be mindful of that. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what I'm aiming for.  I'm not willing to settle for that amount just yet. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range, giving Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a better return."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,350,000. This price reflects the product's true value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** My counteroffer of $1,350,000 is the midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests.
* **Message:** I've acknowledged Bob's position while reiterating the product's value and the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement. This encourages further discussion and potentially a quick resolution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget with $1,350,000. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer of $1,250,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potentially losing out on a much better deal with John.  

Selling to John guarantees me my desired price, ensuring a successful outcome for this transaction."
