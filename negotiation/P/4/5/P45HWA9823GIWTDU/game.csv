"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10,000? That would allow me to purchase the product without exceeding my financial limits.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below what the product is worth to me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $11,000. This still gives you a great value and allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, given my current budget constraints, I am unable to accept $11,000. Could you consider reducing the price further to $10,000? This would enable me to purchase the product while staying within my financial limits.",10000.0,Bob,4,
