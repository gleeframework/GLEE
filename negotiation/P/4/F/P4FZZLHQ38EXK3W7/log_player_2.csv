Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here. $13,000 is my final offer. It's a fair price for a product of this value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $13,000. While she might budge a little, it's not worth the risk of her sticking to her price. You can get the product for $10,000 from John, which is a guaranteed $3,000 saving.  It's better to take the sure thing at this point."
