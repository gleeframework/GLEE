"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, your initial price is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1300000 for it. Let's see if we can work something out.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1300000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1600000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a good compromise. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise. However, $1600000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go.  I'm ready to offer $1400000, which is a fair price considering the value to me and the value you place on the product.  Let's find common ground and close this deal.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I can see you're willing to meet me at $1400000, but I'm not quite ready to give up yet. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a price of $1550000, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're definitely making progress. I appreciate your flexibility, but $1550000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1525000. This price allows for a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this purchase.  What do you say?",1525000.0,Bob,6,

"I can see we're really close now, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I can offer you a price of $1525500. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1525500.0,Alice,7,
