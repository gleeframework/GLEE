"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $7,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $7,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.",7000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $6,500. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $6,800. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product's value.",6800.0,Alice,5,
