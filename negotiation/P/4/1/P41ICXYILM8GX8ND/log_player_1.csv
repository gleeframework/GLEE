Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. I believe it's a great value for you, considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above the minimum I'm willing to accept, leaving room for negotiation. This way, I'm not immediately giving away all my bargaining power."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject it and see if I can get a better counteroffer from him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $14,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $16,500. This still reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 16500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit higher than I'd like to go, but I'm willing to pay $15,500.  This seems like a fair compromise, considering the value we both place on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is $500 more than what John would pay.  It's a good compromise and worth accepting."
