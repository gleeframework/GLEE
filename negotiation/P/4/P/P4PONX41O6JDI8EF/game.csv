"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant benefits it offers.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time. This is the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay, considering my own valuation. Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. I understand your perspective, however,  $800,000 significantly undervalues the true potential and worth of this product. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a substantial reduction and reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,900,000 is still out of my price range. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This reflects a fair compromise considering my budget and the value I place on the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems we're making progress. I appreciate you moving towards a more realistic price point. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to consider a price of $1,600,000. This is a significant concession on my end and reflects my commitment to closing this deal.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to recoup a good price, but $1,600,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair offer considering we're both trying to meet in the middle. I'm confident that this product will be profitable for you at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're getting close! I appreciate your willingness to compromise. To show you I'm serious about closing this deal, I'm willing to accept $1,450,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a very fair price given the product's value. What do you say?",1450000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your coming down in price, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me. To finalize this deal, I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000. This is my absolute final offer. I hope we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,8,
