"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply not viable for me.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This gives you a great deal, and it allows me to recoup some of my investment. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $1,000,000 is closer, my budget ceiling is really around $700,000. If you're willing to meet me around there, I'm ready to close the deal.",700000.0,Bob,4,
