{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, and it gives me a good starting point. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000, so he has room to negotiate upwards.
* **It's below my minimum:** I'm willing to sell for at least $1,500,000, so I have room to negotiate downwards.
* **It's a strong first offer:**  It shows I'm serious about selling but also sets a high bar for Bob.

This strategy allows me to potentially get a higher price than John's offer while still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and even below his own valuation of $800,000.  I will counteroffer to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply not viable for me.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This gives you a great deal, and it allows me to recoup some of my investment. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $1,000,000 is closer, my budget ceiling is really around $700,000. If you're willing to meet me around there, I'm ready to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $700,000 is closer to my minimum price, it's still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. I've already tried to negotiate with Bob and I'm not confident that I can get a better price from him.  John is offering a guaranteed $1,500,000, which is the best option for me at this point."
