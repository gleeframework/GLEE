"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing it. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, and I appreciate your willingness to engage in this negotiation. However, $900,000 is a bit too low for me to accept at this point. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, reflecting the value of the product and allowing for a reasonable profit margin for both of us. I'm confident this price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility in coming down to $950,000. However, I'm still a bit above that number. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $975,000. I believe this price is fair and reasonable, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts on this counteroffer?",975000.0,Bob,4,
