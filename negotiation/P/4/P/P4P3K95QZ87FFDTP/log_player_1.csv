Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1800000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for this product. This is my maximum offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I understand his position, I'm confident that I can get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is a significant compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1500000 is still above my budget. Let's meet in the middle at $1350000. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, $1,350,000 is a good compromise and it's better than selling to John for $1,200,000. I'm confident that I can secure a higher price with other buyers in the future."
