"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is great, $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response.  While I understand your position, $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm willing to accept.  Could you do $13,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value this product will bring you.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about $11,000? That's a significant move on my end, and I think it's a fair compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your continued interest.  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still lower than I'd be comfortable with. I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, you're really making this a tough decision! I'm willing to go up to $12,250.  That's my final offer.  I think it's a very fair price considering the value of the product.",12250.0,Bob,6,
