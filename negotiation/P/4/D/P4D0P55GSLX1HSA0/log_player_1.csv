I'm starting with an offer of $10,000. This is a price that's higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation and potential for Bob to get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to get closer to $10,000.  I'll counter with a slightly lower offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering $9,500. It's a compromise that's still favorable to me, and gives Bob a bit more room to negotiate."
