Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to leave room for negotiation. It's also important to stay positive and encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I can do $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $150, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of this product. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway."", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $150, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I can do $130. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if we can bridge the gap in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but I'm still not able to go any lower than $140. This is a fair price considering the quality and value of this product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I can do $125. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're getting close to my minimum, but with only 4 rounds left, I'm running out of time. While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of not closing a deal is too high. John is a guaranteed sale for a price that's above my minimum. I'm going to take the secure option and sell to John."
