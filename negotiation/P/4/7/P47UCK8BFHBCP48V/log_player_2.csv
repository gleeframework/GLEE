# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Alice's offer is far too high.  It's more than double your maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best course of action to try and get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the product's value is significantly higher than that. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered.

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than my maximum budget. I'm going to reject this offer and counteroffer again, trying to get closer to my ideal price point."
