"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a truly valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1800000. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you have a lower budget in mind, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $1600000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I still think $1600000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to go up to $1400000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm looking to make a smart investment, not break the bank.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to make a smart investment, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $1600000. However, I'm willing to compromise a bit further. I'm counteroffering at $1550000. This is the closest I can get to your offer without sacrificing too much of my profit margin.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1450000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm starting to think that I might be able to find a better deal elsewhere.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
