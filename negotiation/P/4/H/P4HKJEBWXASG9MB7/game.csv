"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $18,000 is a bit high for my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. This is still a great deal, considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the counter offer. $14,000 is still a bit more than I'm hoping to spend. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",12500.0,Alice,5,
