Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing John is a guaranteed $150.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, getting you closer to your maximum. 
* **Appear Reasonable:**  While a higher price might tempt fate, a slightly lower price might make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal and be more inclined to accept."
