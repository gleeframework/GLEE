{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  $10,000 is a good starting point, but I want to see if I can get it for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, as I believe the product is worth less than $10,000 to me.  Let's see if Alice is willing to come down a bit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is a better offer than $10,000, I'm still confident I can get a better price.  I'm going to try to push Alice further with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to try to meet Alice halfway.  I believe $9,000 is a fair price, and I'm hoping Alice will agree to it."
