Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this unique product.  I value it highly, but I'm confident it's worth a significant sum to you as well, given its potential. I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you have a strong fallback position. This allows you to start negotiations with Bob at a significantly higher price.
* **Justification for High Price:** The message emphasizes the ""unique"" nature of the product and its potential value to Bob. This helps justify the high asking price. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer is a way to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay a premium. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Even though the initial offer is high, it leaves room for negotiation.  You can potentially settle on a price lower than $2,000,000 but still significantly higher than your fallback of $1,500,000."
