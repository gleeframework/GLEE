Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price. This is a bold move, but it shows that I'm serious about negotiating and I'm willing to go low. I believe that Alice might be willing to come down a bit to avoid losing the deal."

This counteroffer demonstrates that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm also prepared to walk away if we can't reach a mutually agreeable price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000}

I'm increasing my counteroffer again,  trying to find the sweet spot where Alice might be willing to accept. My goal is to bridge the gap between our current positions, but I'm still mindful of my budget and the value I'm willing to pay.  We are getting closer, and I'm optimistic that we can finalize a deal in the remaining rounds."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my ideal price, but it's still not there. With only 3 rounds left, I want to try one more counteroffer to see if we can close the deal.  I'm also still mindful of the risk of buying from John at a significantly higher price, so I'm not ready to accept yet."

Round 8

This is the last round before I have to buy from John.  Alice's offer is close to my last counteroffer, and with only one round remaining, I'm running out of time.  Although it's not my ideal price,  accepting this offer is the best option to avoid paying significantly more to John."
