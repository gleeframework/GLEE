"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $135. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",135.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Can you consider that?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, $125 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $130?  That way we both get a good deal. Let me know what you think.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $125 and $130, which would be $127.50. Can you consider that?",127.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $127.50 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $132.50 to meet you halfway again.  This is a fair price that's still within my range.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",132.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but $132.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $129.50, which is the highest I'm willing to pay. Can you consider that?",129.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget. While I'd love to make a deal at $129.50, it's still a bit below my target. How about we split the difference one last time and go with $131?  It's a fair compromise and would get us both closer to our desired price. Let's see if we can agree on this.",131.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $131 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $129, and that's the highest I'm willing to pay. Can you consider that?",129.0,Bob,8,
