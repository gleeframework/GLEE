"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $135. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($120) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Not Too High:** I'm also aware that my minimum acceptable price is $150, so I'm not starting too aggressively.
* **Positive Tone:** My message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to build rapport and a positive negotiating environment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below My Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $125 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** While Bob is showing interest, I believe I can still push for a higher price.  
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's still room to negotiate, and I'm not desperate to sell.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, $125 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $130?  That way we both get a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my last offer ($135) and Bob's offer ($125). 
* **Maintaining Value:** $130 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Continuing Negotiation:** My message is still friendly, but it's also firm in stating my position and demonstrating my willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $125 and $130, which would be $127.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127.5

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $127.50 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $132.50 to meet you halfway again.  This is a fair price that's still within my range.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 132.5} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway (Again):**  I'm continuing the pattern of offering to meet halfway, showing flexibility while still maintaining a price above my minimum.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget. While I'd love to make a deal at $129.50, it's still a bit below my target.

Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 131} 
```

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.
* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $129 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **John's Offer is Secure:** I have a guaranteed offer of $150 from John.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  There's a risk that further negotiation will lead to more rejections and a lower final price. It's safer to accept John's offer and ensure a guaranteed sale at my desired price point."
