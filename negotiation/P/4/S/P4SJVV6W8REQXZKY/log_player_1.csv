Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  You're not selling yourself short, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** This allows for back-and-forth negotiation, potentially leading to a higher price for you.

Remember, you can always walk away and sell to John for $10,000 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out in your favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $11,000? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to Bob.  It's worth exploring if you can get a better price. 

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to send a counteroffer to Bob.  Consider a price slightly lower than your initial offer, but still above Bob's offer. For example, you could try $12,500.  This shows that you're willing to negotiate but are also confident in the value of the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $12,500? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This offer shows Bob that you're willing to negotiate but also that you believe the product is worth more than his current offer. 
* **Fairness:** $12,500 is a good middle ground between your initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Motivation:**  This could be enough to push Bob to accept, especially if he truly values the product at $15,000. 

**Remember:** If Bob rejects this counteroffer, you can always choose to sell to John or continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $12,000? That's a fair compromise, and we both walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your target:** $12,000 is very close to your previous offer of $12,500.  
* **Potential for better deals:** While you might be able to get a little more with further negotiation, the risk of Bob backing out or accepting a lower offer from John is high.  
* **Time is money:** Continuing to negotiate could drag things out.  

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Bob's offer of $12,000 ensures you get a good price for the product without risking a lower offer or losing the deal altogether."
