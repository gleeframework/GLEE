"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $1,100,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $850,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to move closer to your range.  How about we consider $1,000,000? I believe this reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is my final offer, let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  You've stated $900,000 is your final offer, and I want to be respectful of your position.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down slightly to $975,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it represents a very fair deal. Let me know if this works for you.",975000.0,Alice,5,
