{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($10,000), but still leaves room for negotiation to potentially reach a price closer to Bob's perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still a bit low.  I'm confident I can get a bit more. I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price. How about $11,000? It's a fair compromise and still a great deal for you. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a higher price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750?  That's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd like to push for a bit more, Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  Accepting his offer is the best choice here."
