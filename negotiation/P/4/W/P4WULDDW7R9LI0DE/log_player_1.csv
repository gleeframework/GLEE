Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I am willing to pay $12,250 for the product. This is the highest I can go while still staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
At this point, it's more advantageous to accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $12,250.  While you could continue negotiating, you're getting close to John's offer of $12,000. There's a risk of Bob walking away, and you'd be left with John's offer.  Accepting now secures a slightly better price."
