"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in.  I'm asking $120 for it.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to attempt to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. Would you be willing to come down to $100?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference at $110?  That way, we can both get a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now within your budget:** $110 is less than your maximum $150.
* **Further negotiation might be too risky:** While you could try to get a lower price, Alice might not budge further.
* **Time is a factor:**  Continuing to negotiate could waste time, and you could lose the product to another buyer.

It's a reasonable compromise to accept Alice's offer and secure the product."
