Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in.  I'm asking $120 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $120, which is significantly higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly tone:** A friendly approach helps build rapport and encourages Bob to engage. 
* **Open-ended question:** Asking ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to respond and start the negotiation.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** A higher starting price allows for more room to compromise and potentially reach a price closer to Bob's value.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:** His response will indicate how serious he is about buying and how much he values the product. 
* **Set the tone for a positive negotiation:**  A friendly and open approach can lead to a more successful outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. Would you be willing to come down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While $100 is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $80 floor I've set for myself.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired value. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Showing that I'm not willing to settle for less than a certain price can encourage Bob to come up with a more competitive offer.

**Next steps:**

I will now counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired value, aiming for a deal that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference at $110?  That way, we can both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise by coming down from my initial offer.
* **Fairness:**  Splitting the difference feels fair to both parties, suggesting a win-win scenario.
* **Positive framing:**  ""We can both get a good deal"" emphasizes the potential benefits for Bob, making the offer more appealing.

This strategy aims to:

* **Reach a mutually acceptable price:**  $110 is a significant improvement on Bob's offer and closer to my desired value.
* **Maintain bargaining power:**  I'm still not settling for his initial offer, demonstrating that I'm firm in my price expectations.
* **Encourage a quick resolution:** By suggesting a compromise, I'm hoping to avoid further back-and-forth negotiations."
