**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, he's unlikely to reach a price point that significantly surpasses $1,000,000.  We're now past the halfway point in the negotiations, and the increments are getting smaller. Accepting his current offer would mean a loss of $225,000 compared to John's guaranteed offer. It's time to cut our losses and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
