"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its value to you. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

You can save money by counteroffering.  While $1,000,000 is a good deal, you have room to negotiate lower."

Alice's offer:
