Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will be interested in the product and will be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $18,000 is close to my minimum value, I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 19000}
```

I'm going to counter with $19,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it still allows me to earn more than my minimum. I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a fair price and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $17,500 is a decent price, I believe I can still get a better offer.  I'll counter Bob one more time before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18500}
```

I'm going to counter with $18,500.  This is a slight concession, but it's still a good price for me. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, as it's getting closer to his previous offer and a better deal than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is not budging, and I'm getting closer to my minimum. While I would like to get closer to my asking price, it's not worth risking a prolonged negotiation and potentially ending up with less than what John is offering.  I'm going to sell to John."
