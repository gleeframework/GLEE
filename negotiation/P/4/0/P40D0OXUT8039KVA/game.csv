"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm happy to pay $850,000, which is still a good price for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $850,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to $900,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle at $875,000?  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $875,000 is still a little high for me.  I'm committed to $850,000, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,
