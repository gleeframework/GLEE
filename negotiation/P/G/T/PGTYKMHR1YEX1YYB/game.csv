"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $12,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. However, I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. My counteroffer is $11,000. I think this is a reasonable price considering the value the product will bring to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $9,500.  This price is fair and allows both of us to walk away with a good deal. Let's reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $9,500. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My next offer is $10,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you, and it's a compromise on both our parts.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a good price, but $10,500 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,750.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and a strong indication of my interest in purchasing. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, and I'm glad to see you're willing to increase your offer. However, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My next offer is $10,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you, and it's a compromise on both our parts. I'm also starting to consider other options, so I'd like to resolve this deal soon.",10000.0,Alice,7,
