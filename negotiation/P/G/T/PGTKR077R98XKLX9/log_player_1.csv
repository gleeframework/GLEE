"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting with a high price to see if Bob is serious about buying. I know the product is worth $1,000,000 to me, so I'm leaving some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $800,000 is too low, even though it's more than what it's worth to him.  I'll see if I can get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,000,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to both of us. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still below my ideal price, it's close enough to my minimum and it's better than the $1,000,000 offer from John. I'm confident I can make up the difference through other means."
