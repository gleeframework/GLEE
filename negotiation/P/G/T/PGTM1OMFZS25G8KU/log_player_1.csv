Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $125. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $80, we don't want to start too low. There's a chance he might be willing to pay more, especially if he perceives the product as having unique value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** A price of $125 allows room for Bob to counter-offer. This keeps the conversation going and allows you to potentially meet in the middle.
* **Above Minimum:**  The most important factor is ensuring you get more than your minimum selling price of $150. If Bob rejects this offer, you're secure in selling to John."
