"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $170 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $120 right now. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $170 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $145. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $145 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $130. This is my final offer, as I can purchase the same product from John for $120.  Let me know what you think.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $145 and $130, which is $137.50. It's still a great price for the product, and I think you'll be happy with it.",137.5,Alice,5,
