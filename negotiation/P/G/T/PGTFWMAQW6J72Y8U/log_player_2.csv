"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I'm willing to offer it to you for $170. It's a great deal, and I think you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $170 is way over his budget, and he can get the same product from John for $120.  He should use the counteroffer rounds to try and get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $170 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $120 right now. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $170 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $145. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to his budget, he can still get the product from John for $120. He should keep negotiating with Alice to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $145 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $130. This is my final offer, as I can purchase the same product from John for $120.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $145 and $130, which is $137.50. It's still a great price for the product, and I think you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $137.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $120.  While Alice has come down in price, $137.5 is still more than Bob is willing to pay.  He's already stated that $130 is his final offer, and John offers a better price.  There's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice."
