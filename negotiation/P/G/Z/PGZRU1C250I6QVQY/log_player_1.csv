"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price close to my minimum acceptable price, but leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:**  The message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counter-offer, which is crucial to keep the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $9,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $8,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  
* **Negotiation is Key:**  While I'm aware that selling to John for $10,000 is always an option, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price through negotiation. 
* **Opportunity for a Counteroffer:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $8,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Flexibility:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Appealing to Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value by calling it a ""great deal"".
* **Positive Language:** I'm using positive language to create a sense of cooperation and increase the chances of reaching a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $9,000 is still a bit above what I'm aiming for. How about we split the difference at $8,750? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:**  While Bob has come closer to my minimum price, $8,750 is still below my desired amount.  I want to see if I can push for a better price.
* **Potential for Higher Counteroffer:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counteroffer with a price slightly lower than my previous one, which could potentially lead to a more favorable outcome.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:**  While selling to John for $10,000 is an option, I'm still hoping to get closer to that price through negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. I'm willing to come down to $8,900. That's a fair price that acknowledges your needs while still reflecting the product's value. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 8900}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This is my final offer. I'm lowering my price again, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. However, it's also a price that is close to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasis on Agreement:** The message highlights the potential for closing the deal and stresses the fairness of the offer for both parties. 
* **Time Pressure (Implied):**  While not explicitly stated, the message implies a sense of urgency to close the deal, which could subtly push Bob towards accepting."
