"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $8,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to an agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $9,000 is still a bit above what I'm aiming for. How about we split the difference at $8,750? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
