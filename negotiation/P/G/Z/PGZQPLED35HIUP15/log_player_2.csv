Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate a good price, but $7,750 is still a bit low for me. How about we settle on $8,250? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $8,250.  At this point, cutting my losses and buying from John for $8,000 is the best way to maximize savings."
