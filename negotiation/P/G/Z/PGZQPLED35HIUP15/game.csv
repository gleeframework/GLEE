"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial offer.  While $8,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,000. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate a good price, but $7,750 is still a bit low for me. How about we settle on $8,250? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",8250.0,Alice,5,
