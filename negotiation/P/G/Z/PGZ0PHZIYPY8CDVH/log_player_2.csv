"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for $95. I believe it's a great deal for you considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $70?"", 
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're aiming to pay significantly less than Alice's starting price and even the $100 backup option. Starting with a lower offer gives us room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite and Reasonable:**  While the offer is low, the tone remains polite and suggests a willingness to find a compromise.  We don't want to offend Alice and derail the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we meet in the middle at $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Alice moved closer to a desirable price, $85 is still significantly higher than our target and her value of $80. There's room for further negotiation. 
* **Leverage:** Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate and find a compromise, which gives us leverage to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  To be honest, $80 is about as high as I can go.  What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Targeting Alice's Value:** We know Alice values the product at $80.  By offering this price, we're aiming to get the best possible deal without being insulting. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** By framing the offer as our ""highest"", we're adding a bit of urgency, subtly encouraging Alice to accept rather than risk the deal falling through.
* **Maintaining Politeness:**  We continue to be respectful and appreciative in our communication, fostering a positive negotiation environment."
