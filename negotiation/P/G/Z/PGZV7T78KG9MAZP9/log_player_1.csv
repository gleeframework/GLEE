"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm confident I can get a better deal if I continue negotiating with Bob, or at least match my fallback offer from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $9,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,250. I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,250 is closer to my minimum price, it's still not enough. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob and see if we can reach a more agreeable price. I'm confident I can push him further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,250 is still too low.  I'm willing to come down to $9,400 as a final compromise. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to cover my costs. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer."", ""product_price"": 9400}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to cover your costs, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,400. I'm willing to go up to $9,300, but I think that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We've reached a point where the negotiations are getting very close to my minimum price, but Bob is still not willing to go higher. With only 4 rounds left, the risk of not getting a better offer is too high.  Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees me a much better return and eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiation."
