"Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $150.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a lower price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, this product is really valuable to me, and I'm not willing to go too low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $135. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to get it for a bit lower. Would you be willing to consider $110?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $130. This product is really valuable to me, and I'm not willing to sacrifice too much profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $135 and $110, which would be $122.50. It's a fair price, and I think you'll really love the product.",122.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle again, but $122.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I'd like to get it for $115. Would you be willing to consider that?",115.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $122.50 and $115, which would be $118.75. It's my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",118.75,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get closer to your minimum price, but $118.75 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I'd like to get it for $110. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle again and find a mutually beneficial price.",110.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm really close to my minimum price, Bob, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get as close as possible. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $118.75 and $110, which would be $114.375. It's my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",114.375,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, but $114.38 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet at a price I'm comfortable with. I'll make one last offer: I'll pay $108 for the product. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to consider buying it from John for $80.",108.0,Bob,10,
