"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,500,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my costs.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a profit, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and I believe it's a fair price that allows both of us to reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,350,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $1,380,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a price that reflects the product's value to you.",1380000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,380,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,360,000. This is a final offer from me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1360000.0,Bob,6,
