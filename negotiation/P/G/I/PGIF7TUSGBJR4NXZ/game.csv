"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product and understand your desire for a fair profit. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000. This amount aligns more closely with my valuation of the product, and I believe it offers a reasonable compromise for both parties.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is closer to our starting points, I'm still looking for a price that reflects the true value of this product. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $950,000 for it. This allows both of us to benefit from the transaction.",950000.0,Alice,3,
