"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is closer to our starting points, I'm still looking for a price that reflects the true value of this product. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $950,000 for it. This allows both of us to benefit from the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.
