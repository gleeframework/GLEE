"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is a better price than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above your maximum budget of $10,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $11,500 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  It's a fair price, and I'm sure we can both be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's price, but it's still within your budget. It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation, and it leaves room for further bargaining if necessary.  It also shows Alice that you're serious about buying the product but are also committed to getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10,500 is just a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This price still gives you a great value, and I think we can both be happy with it. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a slight improvement over Alice's previous offer, it's still above your budget of $10,000. You've already tried to negotiate and Alice seems unwilling to come down to your desired price. Since you have a guaranteed alternative with John who's selling the product for $10,000, it's best to take the sure thing and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Alice."
