``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. It's also below Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000, giving him an incentive to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While Bob's offer is above my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer. I believe I can do better, so I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offering."

Bob's offer:
