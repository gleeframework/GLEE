"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $9,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,000. Considering the value it brings to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $11,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

We're making progress, but we can still negotiate a little further. Alice is coming down, so let's see if we can meet closer to the middle."

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire for a compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10,000. Considering the value it brings to you, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

This seems like a reasonable compromise.  We're getting close to my walk-away point, and Alice seems firm on her price. Accepting now avoids the risk of the deal falling through."
