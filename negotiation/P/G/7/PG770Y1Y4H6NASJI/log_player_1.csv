Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $8,000, but it gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. I want to see how much Bob is willing to pay before I consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While I would be happy with $8,000 from John, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial price of $10,000. I will counteroffer Bob to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm counteroffering Bob with $9,000.  This is a compromise, but still above my minimum value and closer to my initial offer.  I'm hoping this will be acceptable to Bob, but I'm prepared to consider a further counteroffer if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is $8,500, which is higher than John's offer of $8,000.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a good deal and avoids the risk of further negotiation. I will accept Bob's offer."
