"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1000000 is significantly below the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1300000.  This reflects a considerable price adjustment, and I believe it's a fair offer that benefits both of us.  Let's make this happen!",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1300000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and settle at $1150000.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
