"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a lot to me, but I'm confident it's equally valuable for your business. I'm starting with a price of $1,750,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,200,000 at this point. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your price point.  While $1,200,000 is below what I'm looking for, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000 to see if we can make this work. This still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. How about $1,400,000?  I believe this price is fair and allows us both to achieve a beneficial outcome.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  $1,400,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from my target.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This represents a significant concession on my end, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal. Let me know what you think.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,450,000 is still outside my budget. I'm ready to finalize the deal at $1,350,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
