Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $11,500 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm tempted by the $12,000 from John, I'm not ready to give up on Bob yet. I believe we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $11,000? That's a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $10,500.  Let's get this done! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  $10,500 is still too low for me, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'm going to make one more counteroffer before I seriously consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close!  I'm willing to drop the price to $10,750. This is my final offer. If you're serious about buying this product, let's make a deal.  Remember, John is still waiting in the wings, and I'm not afraid to sell to him."", ""product_price"": 10750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to close this deal, but I'm not sure I'm ready to budge yet.  How about $10,600?  This is a fair compromise for both of us, and we can finally seal the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  We're getting close to the end of the negotiation, and I'm getting nervous about John.  $10,600 is a decent price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely."
