"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! As we're just getting started, I'd like to make a fair and reasonable offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. I can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 6500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $9,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd be happy to sell the product to you for $7,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $7,500 is better, I think there's still room for negotiation. I'll try to inch closer to a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $7,500 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to compromise further. I'd be happy to sell the product to you for $7,250. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This seems like a fair compromise. Alice is signaling this is her final offer, and $7,250 is a good price, saving me $2,750 from John's offer."
