"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $1,150,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budgetary constraints, $1,050,000 doesn't quite meet my minimum requirement for this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,100,000. This price reflects the true value of the product and allows for some room for negotiation.  Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
