"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth at least $12,000 to me, and I believe it would be equally valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,500.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is starting at $12,500, which is above your maximum price.  You know you can get the product for $12,000 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the door for her to potentially come down in price or you can buy from John at your desired price point."
