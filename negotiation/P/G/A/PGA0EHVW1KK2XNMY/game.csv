"Alice, your initial offer is significantly above my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $900,000 at this time. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I believe it's a good starting point for our negotiation.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000. This price still represents a significant discount from my initial offer, but I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is still more than I can afford right now.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,050,000, which is a significant move on my part.  I believe this is a fair price, and I'm eager to finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $1,050,000. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, but I'm also considering other options. I'm willing to make a compromise, so I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's split the difference. I'll offer $1,100,000, which is a fair compromise considering your previous offer and my budget. I'm ready to close the deal at this price.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise and find a middle ground. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,150,000 and $1,100,000, which is $1,125,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident it's a price we can both live with.",1125000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we are getting close. I'm still not able to go as high as $1,125,000. Let's meet in the middle at $1,112,500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal at this price. ",1112500.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,112,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1,120,000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1120000.0,Alice,9,
