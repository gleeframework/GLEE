Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,800,000. This is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  Here's why:

* **Leveraging my minimum:** I need to get at least $1,500,000, and this offer leaves a good margin.
* **Testing the waters:** This initial offer will gauge Bob's interest and potential willingness to negotiate. 
* **John as a safety net:** If Bob rejects, I can always turn to John for the guaranteed $1,500,000.

I'm confident that this strategy will allow me to maximize my profits while still keeping the negotiation open with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is a significant improvement from Bob's initial perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum, and I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob by continuing to negotiate.  

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. This will demonstrate my commitment to getting a better price, and hopefully, encourage Bob to come closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

My counteroffer of $1,600,000 is a compromise. It's a significant decrease from my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. However, it still maintains a buffer above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, ensuring a profitable transaction. 

Here's why I chose this price:

* **Middle ground:** It's a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Pressure on Bob:** This price puts pressure on Bob to come up with a counteroffer closer to my desired range.
* **Flexibility:**  If Bob rejects, I can still fall back on John's offer of $1,500,000. 

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving towards a mutually beneficial agreement, while protecting my financial interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I am committed to getting the best price possible, Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 

Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks further lowering the price, and I am not confident that I can secure a better offer from him.  Therefore, to guarantee a profitable sale and meet my minimum requirement, I will sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
