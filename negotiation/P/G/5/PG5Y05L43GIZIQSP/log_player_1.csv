Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value that aligns with your needs."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit. Since Bob values the product at $15,000, starting at $14,000 leaves room for negotiation while ensuring a significant gain if he accepts.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a safety net with John, ensuring you'll get at least $10,000. This allows you to be bolder with Bob. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** The message highlights the product's value to Bob, making it more enticing while justifying the high price."
