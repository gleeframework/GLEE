"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that's worth at least $1000000 to me, but I'm confident its value to you could be significantly higher. I'm willing to let it go for $1200000. This is a chance to acquire something truly exceptional. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is lower than John's:** Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000, which is $300,000 less than John's price.
* **Your maximum budget is $1,500,000:**  You have room to negotiate, and Alice's offer fits within your budget.

Even if the product isn't worth significantly more to you, the immediate savings of $300,000 make accepting Alice's offer the better choice."
