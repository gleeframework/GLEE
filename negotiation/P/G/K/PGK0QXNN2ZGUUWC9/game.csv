"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I think it's fair considering the value it brings.  Let me know what you think!",11000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I think that's a fair price considering the market value of the product.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $10,500, which is still a good deal for both of us. I'm confident that this product is worth more than that, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $10,250. That's the highest I can go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at that price.",10250.0,Bob,4,
