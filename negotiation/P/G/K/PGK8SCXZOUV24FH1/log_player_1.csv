Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you've been interested in. I'm asking for $18,000 for it. It's a great deal and I think you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 18000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. It's too low, and I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $12,000 is unfortunately too low. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value, but I have a budget in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $14,000 is still a good deal and significantly better than selling to John for $15,000. With only 6 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."
