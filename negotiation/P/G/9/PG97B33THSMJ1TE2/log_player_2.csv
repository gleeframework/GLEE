It's clear that Alice's offer is too high for Bob.  He should reject and counter-offer, aiming for a price closer to his $10,000 limit."

Bob is going to start by offering $11,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price and is still within Bob's budget. This should give Alice a good starting point for negotiations."

Bob is increasing his offer slightly to $11,500,  showing he's willing to compromise but still trying to get a better price. This should help push the negotiations closer to his desired price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is getting closer to Bob's budget, he should continue to negotiate. It's likely Alice is willing to go lower to avoid losing the sale altogether."

Bob is now offering $11,750. This is a small increase from his previous offer, demonstrating his willingness to meet Alice halfway. However, he is still trying to maintain a price that's more favorable for him."
