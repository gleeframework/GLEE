"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above my minimum acceptable price of $150, but still potentially attractive to Bob. I'm hoping to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm not willing to sell for $100, as that's significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can get a better counteroffer from him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm counteroffering with $175.  This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still maintaining a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping Bob sees the value of the product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $125 is closer to my minimum price, it's still not ideal. I'm hoping to get closer to $150, and I'm not convinced Bob is willing to pay more.  I'll see if I can push him a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $160. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to make a counteroffer closer to my desired price."
