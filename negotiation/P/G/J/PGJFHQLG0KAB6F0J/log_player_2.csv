{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**  Alice's offer is way too high ($12,000) compared to your maximum budget ($8,000).  It's best to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Explanation:** I'm starting with my absolute maximum budget of $8,000. This is a bold move, but it establishes a clear boundary for the negotiation. It's unlikely Alice will accept this immediately, but it sets the stage for further bargaining."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**  While $9,500 is closer to my budget, it's still above my comfort zone. I'll continue to negotiate, aiming for a price closer to $8,000. There are still rounds left, and I might be able to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:** Alice is still offering a price higher than my desired $8,000.  While $9,000 is tempting, I'm going to stick to my negotiation strategy and keep aiming for a lower price.  There are still rounds left, and I'm hopeful that Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750} 
```

**Explanation:**  I'm increasing my offer again, this time to $8,750. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still not willing to pay her full asking price.  It's a reasonable compromise, and hopefully, Alice will be more open to accepting it.  We're getting closer to a deal, and with only a few rounds left, it's time to push for a final agreement."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:** Alice has finally come down to a price that's within my budget. While it's not my absolute ideal of $8,000, it's a fair compromise. Accepting this offer saves me time and potentially more back-and-forth negotiation, and secures the product without having to resort to buying from John."
