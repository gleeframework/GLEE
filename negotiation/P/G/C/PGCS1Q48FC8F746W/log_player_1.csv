Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest! I understand your budget concerns, but $7,000 is quite a bit below my bottom line. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?"", ""product_price"": 8500}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $8,500 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider $7,500? I'm really interested in the product and I'm willing to make a serious offer.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your persistence. It seems like we both see the value in this product.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $8,200?  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 8200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $8,200 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to consider $7,800? I'm really interested in the product and I think we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Bob is very unlikely to go above $8,000. He's consistently inching up his offers, but it's clear he has a firm budget. Accepting his offer of $7,800 means losing out on potential profit. It's time to cut losses and take John's guaranteed $8,000 offer."
