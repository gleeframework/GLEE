"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest! I understand your budget concerns, but $7,000 is quite a bit below my bottom line. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $8,500 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider $7,500? I'm really interested in the product and I'm willing to make a serious offer.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your persistence. It seems like we both see the value in this product.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $8,200?  This is my final offer.",8200.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $8,200 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to consider $7,800? I'm really interested in the product and I think we can work something out.",7800.0,Bob,6,
