Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me the best chance of maximizing my profit while still keeping the deal open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $10,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate further to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob at $12,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept.  I'm confident this is a fair price, considering the product's value to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $11,500 is less than what I initially hoped for, it's still a good deal for me.  It's above my minimum threshold of $12,000, and continuing to negotiate with Bob might lead to a stalemate or me selling to John for $12,000. I'm better off accepting Bob's offer and securing the sale."
