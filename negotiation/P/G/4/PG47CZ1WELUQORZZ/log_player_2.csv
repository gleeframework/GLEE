"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $800,000 is significantly lower than your maximum price of $1,200,000. It's a good starting point, but there's definitely room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to explore a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer! $800,000 is a great starting point, but I'm looking to invest a bit more. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, considering the value I see in this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to invest in the product. However, I'm still a bit below my minimum target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $950,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is getting closer to your maximum price of $1,200,000, there's still room for negotiation. It's better to continue bargaining and see if you can secure a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue the negotiation and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $950,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  I'm happy to compromise further and offer $925,000.  This is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make sure I get a decent return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $925,000, but I need to add a small premium to account for the value I bring to the table. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $975,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $975,000 is a significant improvement from Alice's initial offer, it's still pushing the limits of your budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if you can reach a price closer to $925,000. There's still room for compromise, and you have several rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand you want to maximize your return, but $975,000 is a bit out of my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000 to close this deal.  This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.  Let's work together to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $950,000 is enough to justify the value I bring to the table. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell the product to you for $975,000, but I need to add a small premium to account for the risks involved. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $990,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $990,000 is getting dangerously close to your maximum price of $1,200,000. However, you still have a few rounds left to negotiate and potentially save some money. Rejecting the offer allows you to continue bargaining and see if you can reach a price closer to $950,000. Remember, you can always choose to buy from John if you reach a point where you feel the negotiation is not progressing favorably."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but $990,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $965,000, which is a good compromise that reflects the value of the product and my budget. Let's try to finalize this deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 965000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that we're close, but I'm still not convinced that $965,000 is enough to justify the value I bring to the table. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $980,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $980,000 is still less than your maximum price of $1,200,000, and it's a significant improvement from her previous offers.  It's worth accepting this offer. This is Alice's ""final offer,"" and it is unlikely that you will get a better price in the last round.  You have only one round remaining, and there is a good chance that Alice will refuse your counteroffer and the deal will fall through.  Buying from John at $1,200,000 is significantly more expensive than accepting Alice's final offer."
