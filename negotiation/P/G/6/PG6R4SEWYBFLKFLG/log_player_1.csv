Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've already received, I'm proposing a price of $19,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $8,000, we don't want to anchor our offer too close to that number. Starting high allows room for negotiation and potentially securing a price much closer to John's offer.
* **Creating Urgency:** Mentioning ""interest I've already received"" creates a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The phrase ""What do you think?"" opens the door for Bob to counter-offer, giving Alice a chance to negotiate and potentially meet somewhere in the middle.

It's important to note that this is a starting point. If Bob outright rejects the offer, Alice can always adjust her price downwards, knowing she has a guaranteed offer from John."
