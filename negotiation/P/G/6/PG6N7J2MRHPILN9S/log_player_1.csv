{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $145. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

This offer is slightly above Bob's perceived value of the product, but still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate while also ensuring I don't undervalue the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $145 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150, so I will reject his offer. However, since John is willing to buy the product for $150, I'm not eager to spend much time negotiating with Bob. I'll make a counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise quickly, but I'm ready to move on to John if things don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $137.50? That way we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 137.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $137.50 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $135. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $135 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I could continue negotiating with Bob, John is willing to pay my minimum price, and I'm not willing to risk losing out on that deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
