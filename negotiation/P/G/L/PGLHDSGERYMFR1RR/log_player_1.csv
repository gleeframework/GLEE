Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $1,500,000 is beyond my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000, which reflects the value I'm able to see in it.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product is truly significant. Let's meet halfway â€“ I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000."", ""product_price"": 1250000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,000,000.  This is the most I can afford, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Bob is clearly unwilling to budge beyond $1,000,000.  Since I have a guaranteed offer for that amount from John, it makes no sense to continue negotiations with Bob. It's time to move on."
