"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me.  This product would need to be significantly less for me to consider it.  How about $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,"I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $12,000?"
