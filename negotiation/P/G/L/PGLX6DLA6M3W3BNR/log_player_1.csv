Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm asking for a price of $925,000.  I believe this reflects its worth to you while providing me a fair return."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $1,000,000 as possible since that's Bob's perceived value.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation downward while still exceeding my minimum price.
* **Balance Risk and Reward:**  Offering it for $925,000 gives Bob a potential saving of $75,000, a strong incentive. There's a risk he'll reject it, but the potential gain outweighs settling for John's guaranteed $800,000."
