Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,900 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering our previous discussions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,900.

**Reasoning:** While I could push for more, Bob seems anchored at a price just below $13,000. Accepting his offer of $12,900 secures a significant profit above my minimum ($10,000) and avoids the risk of him walking away in later rounds."
