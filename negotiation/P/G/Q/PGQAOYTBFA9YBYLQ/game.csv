"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $10,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $8,500. This is a good middle ground, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below $8,000. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,3,
