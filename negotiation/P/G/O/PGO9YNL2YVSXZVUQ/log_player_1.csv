"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's something truly special, and I believe it holds immense value for your business. My initial asking price is $1,400,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's potential.  Let's discuss further!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you're placing on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial asking price, it's still above my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial asking price, hoping to get closer to the $1,400,000 I'm aiming for.  There are still rounds left, and I can always sell to John if the negotiations don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While $1,200,000 is tempting, I'm still convinced this product's true value is higher.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to see a price closer to my initial asking price. I'm proposing $1,300,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $1250000 is the highest I can go. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you're placing on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not high enough.  I believe I can squeeze out a bit more, especially since we have several rounds left. There's also the option of selling to John, which provides a safety net. I'm going to counteroffer again, but I'll be willing to come down a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer to an agreement.  I'm willing to drop my asking price to $1,275,000. This is a fair price considering the value you're placing on the product and the opportunity it presents for your business.  Let's make this happen, Bob!"", ""product_price"": 1275000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1240000, but that's as high as I can go. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you're placing on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,240,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,240,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting dangerously close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  However, I'm still hopeful that we can reach a compromise.  I'm going to counteroffer one last time, but if Bob rejects it, I'll sell to John to avoid losing too much money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm ready to make a final concession.  Given your last offer, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,250,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. Let's finalize this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're down to the wire with only a few rounds left.  I'm confident that Bob is very interested in the product, and he's getting closer to my desired price.  This counteroffer is a compromise that allows me to secure a price just above my minimum while keeping Bob happy enough to accept.  If he rejects, I'm prepared to sell to John and walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1235000, but that's as high as I can go. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you're placing on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,235,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,235,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm running out of time. We've reached a point where further negotiation is unlikely to result in a significantly better price. I'm at risk of losing out on a substantial amount of money if we continue.  It's better to secure a guaranteed $1,000,000 with John rather than risk a lower offer from Bob in the remaining rounds."
