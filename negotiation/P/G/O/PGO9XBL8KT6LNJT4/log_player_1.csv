Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $950,000 is more than your minimum of $800,000, ensuring you profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** The offer is below Bob's perceived value, allowing for potential counteroffers and a mutually beneficial outcome. 
* **It demonstrates you're serious:** A high initial offer shows you are not just looking for the absolute minimum but willing to negotiate.

Remember, this is just the first offer.  Be prepared to counter Bob's offers or walk away and sell to John if necessary.  Good luck!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above your minimum of $800,000, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer. You've already established a higher price point, and it's worth exploring if you can get closer to your desired price. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you can make a counteroffer that bridges the gap and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $850,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $900,000? It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

Here's why this counteroffer is a good strategy:

* **It's still above your minimum:** $900,000 is still higher than your minimum of $800,000.
* **It shows flexibility:** By coming down from your initial offer, you demonstrate a willingness to negotiate.
* **It's a reasonable middle ground:**  $900,000 is halfway between your previous offer of $950,000 and Bob's offer of $850,000.

This counteroffer gives Bob a chance to reconsider without completely rejecting your position.  You're showing you're serious about making a deal, but you're not giving in too easily."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit short on budget, so I'm willing to go up to $875,000. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your desired price, it's still lower than your minimum acceptable price.  You have a few options:

* **Reject and counteroffer:** You could counteroffer again, perhaps with a price slightly lower than your previous $900,000.  This could show you're willing to compromise but not desperate to sell at his price.
* **Sell to John:** If you're unsure about Bob's commitment and want to secure a sale quickly, selling to John for $800,000 is an option.

The best approach depends on your risk tolerance and how determined you are to get the best price from Bob. If you have the time and are confident you can get a better price, rejecting and counteroffering is a good strategy.  If you need the money quickly or are unsure about Bob's negotiating power, selling to John might be the more pragmatic choice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a tight budget, but $875,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  How about $887,500? This is a fair price that acknowledges your budget and my value for the product. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 887500}
```

Here's why this counteroffer makes sense:

* **It's a compromise:** You've moved closer to Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **It's still above your minimum:**  $887,500 is above your minimum of $800,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's a clear signal:** You're making a final push to close the deal, indicating that you're serious but also ready to walk away if Bob won't meet you halfway. 

This counteroffer puts the ball in Bob's court. If he's truly interested, he'll likely accept.  If he rejects, you can then decide whether to take John's offer or try to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but I'm still a bit short. Can you consider $882,500? It's the highest I can go, but I really want this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $882,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $882,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough decision, but here's why accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice:

* **Close to your goal:**  $882,500 is just a small step below your last counteroffer of $887,500. You're very close to your desired price point.
* **Bob's sincerity:**  Bob is emphasizing his desire for the product and has stated this is his final offer.  This suggests he's serious about closing the deal.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While you could counteroffer again, there's a risk that Bob might reject and you'll be left with John's offer of $800,000.  Accepting now secures a higher profit than selling to John.

By accepting, you secure a good price while avoiding further negotiation that could lead to a less favorable outcome.  It's a balanced decision that maximizes your potential earnings while acknowledging the reality of the situation."
