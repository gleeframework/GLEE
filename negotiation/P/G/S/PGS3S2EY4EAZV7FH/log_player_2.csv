Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is significantly higher than what Bob is willing to pay. It's worth seeing if Alice will come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value of the product, $1,200,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to work together to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000. This is a fair price, considering the value the product will bring to your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is lower than the initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget.  Bob should continue negotiating to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $900,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still too high for Bob.  While they are getting closer, Bob is running out of rounds and time. It's more advantageous for him to buy from John at this point to guarantee the purchase within his budget."
