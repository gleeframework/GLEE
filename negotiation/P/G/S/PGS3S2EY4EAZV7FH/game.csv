"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value of the product, $1,200,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us. Let's work together to make this happen.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to work together to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000. This is a fair price, considering the value the product will bring to your business. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $900,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
