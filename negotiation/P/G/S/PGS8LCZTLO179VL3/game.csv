"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I think you'll really appreciate its value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $12,000, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  I appreciate your offer but $18,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is the maximum value I'm willing to spend. I think this is a fair price considering my maximum value and your worth of the product.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. Considering the product's value to me is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. This is a compromise that I think you'll find reasonable.",14000.0,Alice,3,
