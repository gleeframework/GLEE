Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is looking to save as much money as possible. $10,000 is still above Bob's target price of $12,000.  Therefore, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy for Bob at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to get the best deal possible, but also wants to be reasonable and not risk losing the opportunity with Alice. Offering $9,000 is a good starting point for a counteroffer, significantly reducing the price from Alice's initial offer but still leaving some room for negotiation."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is closer to Bob's target price, it is still above his limit. It's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if Alice will budge further. If not, Bob can always resort to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""product_price"": 9250}
```
