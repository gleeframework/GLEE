"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum price of $8,000 but leaves room for negotiation. I believe Bob will be interested in this price as it is still lower than the value he places on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get closer to $10,000. I'm confident that Bob is still interested in the product and will likely counter again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm offering $9,500 for the product.  This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. I think this price is fair and gives Bob a chance to get the product at a price lower than my initial offer, while still giving me a good return."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, we're getting close to my desired price and it's likely that continuing to negotiate will only lead to more back and forth without a guarantee of a better outcome. Accepting this offer allows me to secure a good price and avoid the risk of Bob deciding to walk away or me having to sell to John for a lower price."
