Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering Bob the product for $14,000. This is a price that is:

* **Higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives him some incentive to buy, as he'll be getting a good deal compared to what he's willing to pay.
* **Lower than my minimum value:**  This ensures I still make a profit, even if he accepts.
* **A good compromise:**  If Bob rejects, I can sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not taking a huge risk.

This strategy balances the possibility of making a higher profit with the certainty of selling to John if Bob declines."
