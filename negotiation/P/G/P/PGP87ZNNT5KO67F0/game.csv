"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. However, $12000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. It's a great price for a product of this caliber, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I understand your position, but $11000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10500, which is a fair compromise. If we can't find a middle ground at this price, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still not sure I can go as low as $10500. How about we meet in the middle at $11250? I think that's a fair price for a product of this quality, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $10750. This is a fair price considering I'm trying to stay within my budget. If this doesn't work for you, I'll need to look elsewhere.",10750.0,Bob,6,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your flexibility. I'm willing to meet you at $11000, which is the lowest I can go. If you're still interested, let's make a deal!",11000.0,Alice,7,
