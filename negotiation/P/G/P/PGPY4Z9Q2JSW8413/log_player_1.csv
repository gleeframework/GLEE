Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for a special price of $130. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $150, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price.
* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $80 from John, so any offer above that is profit.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Aiming slightly below Bob's maximum valuation increases the chance he'll accept while securing a significant profit for you. 

**Why this strategy?**

This approach balances risk and reward. A much higher price (e.g., $145) risks Bob rejecting the offer, leaving you with only $80 from John. This offer makes it highly appealing for Bob while still earning you a tidy profit."
