"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

Since you're willing to pay up to $120 for the product, and John is offering it for that price, there's no point in negotiating with Alice. You'll save time and effort by simply buying from John."
