{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, Bob's higher valuation allows me to aim for a significant profit margin.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price of $1,300,000 is strategically placed:
    * It's substantially more than my minimum ($1,000,000) but still leaves Bob with a potential gain ($200,000).
    * It's closer to Bob's perceived value, making it more enticing. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message is phrased to invite further discussion, implying there might be flexibility."
