"Bob, I'm offering you my product for a price that's significantly lower than its true value to me. I know it's worth $800,000 to you, so I'm willing to let it go for $900,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a discounted price. Let me know if you're interested.",900000.0,Alice,1,
