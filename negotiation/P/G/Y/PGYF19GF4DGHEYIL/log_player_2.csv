"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $14,000, which is a great deal considering its value to you is $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is quite high. There's plenty of room for negotiation.  I'll try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to  $10,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($10,000) than Alice's initial price ($14,000). This gives me room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite and Interested:** I'm keeping the tone polite and expressing continued interest in the product. This helps maintain a good negotiation atmosphere.
* **Targeting Value:** I know Alice values the product at $12,000, so I'm aiming for a price that's a good deal for me but still potentially acceptable to her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but $12,500 is still closer to her valuation than mine.  I'll try pushing a little further before considering accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  How about we settle on $11,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm proposing a price that's roughly halfway between our previous offers ($10,000 and $12,500). 
* **Seeking Compromise:**  I'm framing it as a compromise to encourage Alice to accept. 
* **Closing in on John's Price:** While I want to get the best deal, I'm mindful that John offers a fallback at $15,000.  I don't want to push Alice away completely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, I still need to make a profit. I can do $13,000, and that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting Close:**  While I'd prefer a lower price, $13,000 is a reasonable compromise. It's clear Alice is less willing to go much lower.
* **John's Price is a Factor:**  Buying from John at $15,000 is only a $2,000 difference now.  The time and effort to potentially save that amount might not be worth it.
* **Good Deal Overall:**  I'm still getting the product for significantly less than my maximum value of $15,000, making this a good deal overall."
