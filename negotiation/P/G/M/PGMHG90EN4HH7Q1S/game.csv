"I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $90 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $95.  How does that sound?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle again and go for $92.50?",92.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep talking.  $92.50 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  Let's try $94.  That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.",94.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get closer to your target, but $94 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $92, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there?",92.0,Bob,6,
