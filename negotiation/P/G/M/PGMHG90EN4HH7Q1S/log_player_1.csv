"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $80, but lower than my minimum acceptable value of $120. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:**  Using a friendly tone in the message can help build rapport and make Bob more likely to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By offering $100, I'm leaving room for Bob to counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal. 
* **Setting a Deadline:**  While I haven't explicitly set a deadline, mentioning ""let me know if you're interested"" implies that I'm open to other offers but won't be waiting indefinitely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum price, it's still below the $120 I'd like to get. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:** There's room for further negotiation, as Bob clearly wants the product.  
* **Selling to John is a safe bet, but not the best outcome:** While selling to John guarantees $120, I might be able to secure a better price with Bob.

I'll proceed to the next round and counter Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $90 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $95.  How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer with a compromise:** I'm not accepting Bob's offer but I'm showing willingness to negotiate by meeting him halfway.  
* **Focus on the benefit:**  Highlighting the ""split the difference"" aspect emphasizes that the offer is fair.
* **Maintain a friendly tone:** A positive and conversational tone encourages Bob to continue negotiations. 
* **Keeping the goal in sight:**  $95 is still above my minimum, but it's closer to Bob's perceived value, making it a more attractive offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle again and go for $92.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, $92.50 is still below my target.
* **More negotiation is possible:**  There's still room to negotiate, as Bob clearly wants the product and is willing to keep offering.
* **Selling to John is a safe bet, but I want to see if I can get closer to my target:**  While John offers a guaranteed $120, I believe I can get a better deal with Bob.

I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep talking.  $92.50 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  Let's try $94.  That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 94}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying firm but flexible:** I'm not accepting Bob's offer but I'm acknowledging his compromise and showing flexibility by moving closer to his offer.
* **Highlighting the fairness:** I'm emphasizing that $94 is a fair compromise, making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:**  A positive and conversational tone keeps the negotiation friendly.
* **Getting closer to the goal:**  $94 is still above my minimum, and with every counteroffer, I'm getting closer to my target while still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to get closer to your target, but $94 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $92, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum:**  $92 is only $2 away from my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **The negotiation is getting tense:** We are already halfway through the allotted rounds, and Bob has made it clear that this is his final offer. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I reject this offer, there's a risk that Bob might walk away, and I might not be able to get a better offer from him.  Also, there's a chance he won't counteroffer.
* **Selling to John is a safe option, but not ideal:** While John offers $120, it's important to consider that I have already invested time and effort in negotiating with Bob. 

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice at this point. It ensures a sale and secures a price that is close to my minimum acceptable price."
