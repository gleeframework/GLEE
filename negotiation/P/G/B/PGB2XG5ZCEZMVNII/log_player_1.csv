{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I think it's a great deal considering the value it provides. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a little lower than my minimum value, but leaves room for negotiation and still leaves a profit for me.  I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $14,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to his perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum.  I'm going to try to negotiate a bit higher. I'm confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13,250?  It's still a great price for the value you'll get, and I'm willing to make a deal at that point."", ""product_price"": 13250}
