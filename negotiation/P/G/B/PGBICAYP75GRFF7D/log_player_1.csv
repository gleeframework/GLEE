Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might get a deal if he counters.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value,"" Alice hints at the product's worth without revealing her minimum price.
* **Urgency:**  By mentioning listing it publicly, Alice creates a subtle sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to decide quickly. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Alice should be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. She knows her fallback is $12,000 from John, but there's potential to earn more from Bob."
