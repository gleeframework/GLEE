Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  Let me know your thoughts and if you'd like to proceed."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $1,400,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Backup Option:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $1,200,000 provides a safety net. Alice won't accept anything less than that."
