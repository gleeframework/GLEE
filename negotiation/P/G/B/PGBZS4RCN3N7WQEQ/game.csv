,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm not willing to pay that much. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value, but it's more in line with my budget.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to come down some, but $1,800,000 is a bit too low for what this product offers.  How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000? This price reflects the true value and ensures a win-win for both of us.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm proposing $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. It seems we both recognize the value this product holds. How about we settle this at $1,950,000? This final offer keeps it very close to your budget while acknowledging the inherent worth of what I'm offering.",1950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still not comfortable with the final offer. I'm willing to go up to $1,920,000, but no higher. I believe this is the maximum I can afford and still get a good return on my investment.",1920000.0,Bob,6,
