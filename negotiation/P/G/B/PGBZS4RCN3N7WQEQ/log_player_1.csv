"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique features and potential for you, I'm initially offering it at $2,200,000. I believe this price reflects the significant value it holds."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin significantly above both your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This allows room for negotiation and creates the perception that the product is highly valued.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the high price (""unique features and potential"") makes the offer seem more reasonable and encourages Bob to engage in negotiation.
* **Leaving John Option Open:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, we have ample rounds to potentially secure a better deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm not willing to pay that much. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value, but it's more in line with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a significant improvement, we still have room to negotiate.  We're aiming to maximize our profit and are willing to counter to guide the price closer to at least $2,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to come down some, but $1,800,000 is a bit too low for what this product offers.  How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000? This price reflects the true value and ensures a win-win for both of us."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory Tone:** We acknowledge Bob's counteroffer and express willingness to negotiate, fostering a positive atmosphere.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  By suggesting $2,000,000, we're compromising while still aiming for a strong profit margin. This common negotiation tactic can feel fair to both parties.
* **Reiterating Value:** We continue to emphasize the product's value, subtly anchoring the price point in Bob's mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm proposing $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close! While $1,900,000 is tempting, we're still significantly above our minimum. Bob's willingness to move suggests there might be a bit more room for negotiation. Let's try one more time to inch closer to $2,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. It seems we both recognize the value this product holds. How about we settle this at $1,950,000? This final offer keeps it very close to your budget while acknowledging the inherent worth of what I'm offering."",
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Tactic:**  By framing this as our ""final offer"" and making a relatively small concession, we're signaling that this is as low as we're willing to go.
* **Focusing on Agreement:**  We emphasize areas of agreement (value recognition) to build positive momentum towards a deal.
* **Justification:** We provide a clear and brief justification for the price, appealing to both logic and fairness. 

At this point, we're getting close to a point where accepting Bob's next offer (if it's around $1,925,000 or higher) might be the most strategic move.  Each round carries the risk of Bob walking away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still not comfortable with the final offer. I'm willing to go up to $1,920,000, but no higher. I believe this is the maximum I can afford and still get a good return on my investment. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to close the deal!  Here's why:

* **Strong Profit:** $1,920,000 is a significant profit margin, well above our minimum and a good return on the negotiation.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  It's unlikely further negotiation will yield significantly more. Bob has signaled his firm limit, and we risk him walking away entirely. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now means we get the money sooner, allowing us to reinvest or utilize those funds elsewhere. 

While we could potentially squeeze out a bit more, the risk of losing the deal with Bob and having to settle for John's $1,500,000 offer outweighs the potential reward at this stage."
