"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is better than $15,000, it's still above his target of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'd be willing to offer $9,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to his $8,000 target. While $11,000 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still not a good deal for Bob. He should try to negotiate further and see if he can get closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still above my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but I'm not comfortable going lower than $10,500. This price is still very reasonable given the product's value. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his goal, but $10,500 is still a bit too high. He should continue to negotiate and try to get Alice to come down further.  He still has time to see if he can get a better price, and if not, he can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go to $9,800. This is a fair price considering the value I'm getting, and it allows us to reach a deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9800}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not comfortable going below $10,200. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us to both benefit from the deal. Let's find a compromise here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,200 is closer to Bob's target price of $8,000, he only has three rounds left. The negotiation is becoming increasingly difficult, and there's no guarantee that Alice will come down to his price. With the option of buying from John for $8,000, Bob should take the sure thing and avoid the risk of failing to reach an agreement with Alice."
