"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a product of significant value. While I can't disclose the specifics at this time, I assure you it is worth at least $1000000 to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000. This is a price point that reflects both its worth and the potential for substantial returns.  Consider this a chance to acquire something truly special. If you're not interested, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $1000000.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
