Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget of $15,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  This product is worth a lot to both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?"", ""product_price"": 11500}"

# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,500, but that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500.
