"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I can't sell the product for less than $10,000.  I'm going to try and get closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply too low. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,250?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a price closer to your initial offer, Alice.  While $10,250 is closer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $9,500.  Would you be open to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While he's getting closer, $9,500 is still below my minimum price of $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to drop below that threshold."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing we're getting closer to a deal. I'm still not able to go as low as $9,500, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,875. This is my final offer, and if we can't agree on this, I'll have to move on to other buyers. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9875}
