"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply too low. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,250?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal. Let me know what you think.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a price closer to your initial offer, Alice.  While $10,250 is closer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $9,500.  Would you be open to that?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing we're getting closer to a deal. I'm still not able to go as low as $9,500, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,875. This is my final offer, and if we can't agree on this, I'll have to move on to other buyers. What do you say?",9875.0,Alice,5,
