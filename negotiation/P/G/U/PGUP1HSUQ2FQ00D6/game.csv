"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While $1,200,000 is tempting, it's a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This still gives you a significant advantage, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's make this happen!",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,300,000. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. Can you meet me at that price?",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great price, and I'm happy to continue negotiating. However,  $1,150,000 is just a bit too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it gives you a substantial saving. Let's finalize this deal!",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. Can you meet me at that price?",1100000.0,Bob,6,
