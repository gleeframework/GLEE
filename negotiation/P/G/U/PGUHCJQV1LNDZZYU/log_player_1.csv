Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal."", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. May I suggest we aim for $120? Thank you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob's offer is the lowest I can accept, and it matches what John is offering. There's no benefit to further negotiation with Bob."
