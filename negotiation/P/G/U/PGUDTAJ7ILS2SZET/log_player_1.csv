"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're starting at a price that's higher than your minimum of $80, giving you room to negotiate.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** $100 is still lower than what Bob is willing to pay, meaning he has incentive to negotiate.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:**  The message is short and to the point, making it easy for Bob to understand."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $70 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm confident that I can negotiate a better price, and I'm willing to continue the negotiation process.  I'm not yet at a point where I'd rather sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $85? This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has offered my minimum acceptable price of $80. While I'd ideally like to get more, it's important to be realistic.  Accepting this offer will ensure I get at least my minimum and avoid the risk of further negotiation or selling to John for the same price."
