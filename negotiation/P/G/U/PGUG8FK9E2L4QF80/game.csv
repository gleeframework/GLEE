"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be compensated fairly for the value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? This would be a fair price for both of us.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $9,250. How about we try $8,875?",8875.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $8,875 is still a bit too low for me, considering the product's value.  Let's try $9,000.  This would give you a good deal, and it would be a fair price for me.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,000. I'm willing to meet you at $8,900. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",8900.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're firm on your price, but I need to get closer to my desired amount. Let's compromise and meet at $8,950. This is a fair price for both of us and will allow us to finalize this deal.",8950.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,950. I'm willing to meet you at $8,900, and that's my final offer. If you can't accept this, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8,000.",8900.0,Bob,8,
