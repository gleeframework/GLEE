Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,500. I believe it provides significant value at this price."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to $12,000 as possible since that's my guaranteed fallback with John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 allows Bob some wiggle room if he wants to negotiate a slightly lower price while still keeping me well above his perceived value of $10,000.
* **Appear Reasonable:** Offering a price slightly below my guaranteed sale price makes it appear like I'm offering a fair deal."
