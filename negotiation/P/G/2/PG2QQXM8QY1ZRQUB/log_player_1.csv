Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter your offer by proposing a price of $1,050,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $1,050,000 is still too low for me, and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $1,100,000.  How about $1,075,000? That's a fair compromise, and it leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,060,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not there.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway on this.  Let's go with $1,065,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's a good opportunity for you to acquire a valuable product.  Let's seal the deal!"", ""product_price"": 1065000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I am willing to agree on a price of $1,062,500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,062,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,062,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough call, but I'm going to sell to John. While Bob's offer of $1,062,500 is getting close, it's still a significant distance from my ideal price.  I've already spent five rounds negotiating and I'm concerned that continuing will only further reduce the price.  Selling to John guarantees me my desired amount, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price."
