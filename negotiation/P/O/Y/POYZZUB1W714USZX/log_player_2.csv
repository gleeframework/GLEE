"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal for you, and it's well worth the price. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

The product is worth $100 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $115. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $115 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $105.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $105 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a great product and a fair price. Let's make this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

While $110 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his maximum limit of $100. Therefore, the best option for Bob is to buy the product from John for $100."
