"Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $20000. This is a significant discount from its true worth. I'm confident you'll find it an excellent investment. Let me know your thoughts.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $15000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",15000.0,Bob,2,
