,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in it.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product and allows me to meet my own needs.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? This would allow us both to save some money and reach an agreement.  What do you think?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your offer,  $1,175,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to sell for $1,212,500.  This way, we both get a good deal.  What do you say?",1212500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see we're both trying to find a good deal. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $1,200,000, which is still a great price for me. This way, we can both close this deal quickly and avoid any further negotiation.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
