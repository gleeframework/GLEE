This initial offer is slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob, but it leaves room for negotiation. It also shows confidence in the product's value and sets a strong starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.  While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to accept such a drastic price drop.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product and allows me to meet my own needs.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? This would allow us both to save some money and reach an agreement.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $1,175,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further but won't settle for a price that significantly undervalues the product. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can reach an agreement."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see we're both trying to find a good deal. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $1,200,000, which is still a great price for me. This way, we can both close this deal quickly and avoid any further negotiation.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable price, and it would be a waste of time to continue negotiating.  It's a good deal for both of us, and I'd like to close the deal."
