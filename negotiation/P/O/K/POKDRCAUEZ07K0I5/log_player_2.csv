"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $100 to you, and I believe it's a great investment. Let's make it happen! My offer is $95 for this fantastic product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's starting offer is already pretty good, but there's no harm in seeing if I can get it lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! That product looks great, but I'm on a bit of a budget. Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($80) to see how much wiggle room Alice might have. 
* **Polite and Reasonable:** The message is framed politely to maintain a good negotiating atmosphere. While the offer is lower, I'm suggesting it's due to my budget rather than devaluing the product.
* **Room to Negotiate:** This leaves plenty of space for negotiation over the next few rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your interest, Bob! I appreciate your feedback. To make it work for both of us, how about we meet in the middle at $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, moving from $95 to $85. However, there's still room for improvement. I'll reject this offer to signal I'm looking for a slightly better price without being too aggressive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice. How about $82? That's a fair price and would help me out a lot."",
""product_price"": 82
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** By countering with $82, I'm showing Alice that I'm willing to move closer to her price, but in smaller increments. 
* **Justification:**  I'm subtly reinforcing the ""help me out"" angle to appeal to her potential desire for a quick and amicable sale. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer will reveal if Alice is willing to go below $85 or if she's holding firmer to that price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're finding the price reasonable, Bob. Considering the value of the product, how does $83 sound to you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $83. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $83
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimal Gain:** While I might be able to push Alice down a dollar further, the potential savings are minimal at this point. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate risks irritating Alice or missing out on a good deal. She's clearly anchored at $83-$85.
* **Good Deal:**  A $17 discount from the original $100 and $17 savings compared to John's price is a solid outcome."
