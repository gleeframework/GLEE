Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm starting with a price of $90. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a profit.  I'm confident that if he rejects this offer, he'll come back with a counteroffer that is closer to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $75 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price. I believe I can get closer to $80 with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm going to counter with $85. This is still a good price for Bob, as it's only $10 more than his initial offer, and it's closer to my desired selling point.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum acceptable price.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate, as I can secure the same price from John.  I'll accept Bob's offer."
