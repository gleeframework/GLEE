"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product presents a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm pleased to offer it to you.  To kick things off, I propose a starting price of $1,800,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $1,200,000. There's no reason to accept it. It's better to counteroffer or buy from John.  Since I want to save as much money as possible, rejecting and counteroffering allows for potential negotiation and a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,800,000 is far beyond my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $1,200,000 at this time. This is my absolute maximum. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see some movement from your side. How about we meet halfway and consider $1,500,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum. I'm determined to get the product for $1,200,000 or less.  Rejecting and counteroffering gives me another chance to negotiate and potentially reach my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,500,000 is still too high for me.  I'm firm on my offer of $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this price."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
