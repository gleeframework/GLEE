"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,800,000 is far beyond my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $1,200,000 at this time. This is my absolute maximum. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see some movement from your side. How about we meet halfway and consider $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,500,000 is still too high for me.  I'm firm on my offer of $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this price.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
