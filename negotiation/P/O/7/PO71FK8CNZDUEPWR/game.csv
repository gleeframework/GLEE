"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a great price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $90. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $80 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $90 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. How about we meet in the middle at $87? It's a great compromise that still gets me a good price for the product. What do you think?",87.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $87 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $82 for the product. Can we meet at that price?",82.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $82 is a bit lower than my previous offer, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at $84? It's still a good price for the product, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",84.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but $84 is still a bit too high. I'd be willing to pay $79 for the product. Can we meet at that price?",79.0,Bob,6,
