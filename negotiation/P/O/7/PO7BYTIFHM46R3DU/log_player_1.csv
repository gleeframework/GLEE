I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  This offer is also attractive to Bob since it is lower than the product's value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer and try to bridge the gap."

I'm offering the product for $13,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still a good price for me. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in closing the deal and will accept my offer."
