Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product could be incredibly valuable to you, potentially saving you significant resources in the long run. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000.  I think that's a fair price considering the benefits you'll reap."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, aiming for a price closer to that with Bob might scare him off.  
* **Finding Balance:** Offering a price of $1,400,000 still allows us to make a significant profit over Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the potential long-term benefits for Bob helps justify the price and makes it more appealing than just stating a number."
