"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to get the product for as low a price as possible, ideally under $8,000. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's desired price.  Rejecting allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $9,500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's a price I can live with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than his target.  Rejecting allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is tight.  Would you consider $9,000?  I think this would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
