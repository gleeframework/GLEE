Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $950,000.  I believe this is still a fair price for a product worth $1,200,000 to you, and it allows for a healthy profit margin.  Let's see if we can find common ground here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'll offer you the product for $1,050,000. This still gives you a significant saving, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
