You can do better than $1,100,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $950,000 is simply too far below my minimum acceptable value.  I'm willing to compromise, however. I'll offer you the product for $1,050,000. This still gives you a significant saving, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still higher than what John is offering. It's time to take the guaranteed deal from John."
