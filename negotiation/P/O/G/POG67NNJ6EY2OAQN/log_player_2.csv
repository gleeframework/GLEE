"Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's room for negotiation. You're willing to pay up to $1,000,000, and Alice is willing to sell for as low as $800,000. This means a middle ground is likely achievable. Rejecting the offer allows you to explore this middle ground and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price slightly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above her minimum selling price. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while also trying to secure a good deal. It's a fair starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $840,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $840,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is very close to my ideal price, and it's significantly better than buying from John.  Accepting this offer allows me to acquire the product at a good price without further negotiation.  There's a risk that rejecting this offer could lead to a higher price or deadlock, making this the most logical choice."
