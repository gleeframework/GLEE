"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a great fit for you and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $1100000. This is a great opportunity to get this product at a discounted price, and I think you'll really appreciate its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  This means you can save $100,000 by accepting her offer.  While you could get the product from John for $1,200,000, there's no reason to pay more when a cheaper option is available."
