"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can likely get a better deal by making a counteroffer.  While buying from John is always an option, it's the most expensive, and Bob should try to negotiate with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay closer to $12,500.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $13,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $13,250 is closer to his target price, he can still try to negotiate further. There's room for Alice to come down a bit more.  It's important to remember that buying from John is always an option, but Bob should try to squeeze the best deal out of Alice first."
