Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a reasonable starting point, as the product is worth $100 to Bob. I'm hoping to get a good price for it, but I'm also aware that I have the option of selling to John for $100 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm offering a price of $105. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but I'm still aiming for a price that's fair to both of us. I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer and we can finally close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I would have preferred to get more, continuing the negotiation with Bob risks me losing the deal and having to sell to John for the same amount.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get the minimum I'm willing to accept and closes the deal."
