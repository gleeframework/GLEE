Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my offer. I understand your budget constraints and am willing to negotiate. I am proposing a new price of $1,100,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your financial situation.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, I still believe the product is worth more and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with a price of $1,125,000. This still allows for a reasonable profit for you while keeping within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still a little below my ideal price, it's only a small difference and I want to close the deal.  There's a risk that if I keep negotiating, I might not be able to reach a better price, and I could end up selling to John for less."
