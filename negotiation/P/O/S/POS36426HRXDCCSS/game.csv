"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your interests.  Given its unique features, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it. This is the highest I can go at this time. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $2,300,000 is still significantly lower than what I have in mind.  I could be persuaded to let it go for $1,800,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product.  Let me know if this works for you.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,800,000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, but I don't see myself going any higher.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
