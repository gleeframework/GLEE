"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. That starting price is a little high for me, I was hoping to be closer to $1,000,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you counteroffer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,500,000. This is a fair and final offer.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems we are getting closer. While $1,500,000 is still a bit high for my budget, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000 to reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price.  To be frank,  $1,100,000 is still quite a way off from what I had in mind. I'm willing to accept $1,400,000 for this. I believe that reflects the true value while still making it a beneficial deal for you.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close! I can see you're firm on the value, how about we settle at $1,250,000?  That's a significant investment for me, but I'm willing to make it work if we can agree.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
