Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $7,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but $7,750 is still a bit low. How about we settle at $8,250?  This price would be a fair compromise for both of us, and would allow us to finalize the deal. Let me know what you think.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250

Alice is consistently meeting me halfway. While I could buy it from John for $8,000, accepting the deal now at $8,250 saves me time and effort, and is still within my acceptable price range."
