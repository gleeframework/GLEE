"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $95. It's a great opportunity to get it at a discount since it's worth $100 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

You can likely get the product for less than $95.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $85? "", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Let me make a better offer for you. I'll sell the product for $90. This is still a good deal compared to its value, and I hope you'll find it appealing. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90

You're still able to get a better price than $90, so rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering your offer, Bob, I think we can come to an agreement. I'll sell the product for $89. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it's slightly above what you've offered. I hope this works for you.

It's a good deal for you, as you're saving $11 compared to buying from John. Even though you could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting your offer and having to buy from John for a higher price is not worth it."
