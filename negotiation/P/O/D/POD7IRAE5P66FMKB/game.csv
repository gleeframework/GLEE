"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I'd like to get closer to my budget of $100. Can you meet me in the middle?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm happy to work with you, $105 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still offering you a good deal.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget of $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $107.50? That's the best I can do, and I hope it's more reasonable for you.",107.5,Bob,4,
