"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the price. While $12,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product and the benefits it provides. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $17,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $14,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,4,
