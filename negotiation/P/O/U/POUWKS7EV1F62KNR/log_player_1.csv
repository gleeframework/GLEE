Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $85 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $90? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 90}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from $90. I'm willing to pay $82 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting close to John's offer, but it's still not enough to make it worth the risk of continuing to negotiate. With only 4 rounds left, it's safer to sell to John now and guarantee a profit of $80."
