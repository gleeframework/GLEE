"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, we can adjust the price downwards in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  It's less than my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm lowering my price to $175. This is still above my minimum of $150 and hopefully more appealing to Bob than his last offer.  We'll see if he's willing to meet halfway."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm not willing to accept anything below my minimum price.  I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
``` 

I'm lowering my price again to $160. This is a significant compromise, but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my initial valuation. We're running out of rounds, so it's time to get serious!"

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm not going to accept anything less than my minimum.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. We only have a few rounds left, so I'll need to be strategic."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm lowering my price one last time to $155.  This is just above my minimum acceptable price, and we're running out of rounds.  If Bob rejects this, I'll have to sell to John."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're down to the wire.  Bob's offer is still too low. I've lowered my price as much as I can without going below my minimum.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John."
