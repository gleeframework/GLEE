Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm happy to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I have to be honest with you, I was hoping to get closer to my original offer. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1200000 is my minimum, but I'm willing to consider $1100000 as a compromise. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to stretch your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm still not convinced we're at a good meeting point. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1050000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can make a deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is getting closer to Bob's budget, but $1,050,000 is still too high. It's worth trying to negotiate further, as there are still 5 rounds left. Bob can try to lower the price even more, or see if Alice is willing to budge on a lower price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  While $1,050,000 is a better offer, it's still a bit outside my range. To make this work, I need to stay at $950,000.  I truly believe this product will be a great investment for me, and I hope we can find common ground at this price."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're still in talks. However, I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the point where I'd rather sell to John. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1025000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can make a deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  While there are a few rounds left, the conversation is starting to break down, and Alice is even threatening to sell to John. It's becoming increasingly likely that Bob won't be able to negotiate a lower price.  It's better to cut his losses and buy from John, ensuring he gets the product within his budget."
