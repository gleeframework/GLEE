Alice is getting closer to my desired price, but I'm still not at the point where I'd accept. I want to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get her down to $1,100,000."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}

This is my final push.  I'm hoping that Alice will realize it's in her best interest to accept this offer, as I'm not going to go lower.  If she rejects, I'll have to consider buying from John."

Alice has come down a bit further, and although it's not my ideal price, it's still a good deal compared to John's offer. With only a few rounds left, it's not worth risking further negotiation.  I'll accept and move on."
