"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this exceptional product for $1,000,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This creates room for negotiation.
* **Establishing Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, making the price seem more reasonable. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, encouraging him to engage in the process. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while keeping the negotiation open and encouraging Bob to participate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1000000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While Bob has increased his offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain leverage in the negotiation. I show him I'm not desperate to sell and am willing to walk away if the price isn't right.
* **Possibility of a Better Deal:** There's still room for negotiation. I can counteroffer and potentially get closer to my target price.

This approach is about staying firm on my minimum while leaving the door open for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still too far below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise, and I'm offering the product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on it. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing a willingness to meet Bob halfway by lowering my offer. This shows good faith and signals that I'm serious about reaching an agreement.
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm again emphasizing the value the product offers to Bob, reminding him of the potential benefits he'll gain.
* **Strategic Price Point:**  $950,000 is a midpoint between my initial offer and Bob's last offer. This creates a sense of fairness and encourages Bob to consider accepting. 

This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap between our positions and increase the likelihood of a successful deal in the coming rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However,  $950000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $900000.  Let's try to find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer, while higher, is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'm not willing to settle for a price that significantly undervalues the product.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I'm not desperate to sell immediately. There's still room for negotiation, and I'm hoping to push Bob closer to my desired price in the remaining rounds.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I demonstrate my willingness to walk away if necessary, reinforcing my bargaining position.

The remaining rounds allow for further negotiation and potential for a better deal.  Selling to John at this point would be a missed opportunity to potentially achieve a higher price with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your persistence and we're getting closer.  $900,000 is still a bit too low for me,  but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's go with $925,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you.  It's a win-win situation."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** I'm making a small concession to show flexibility and encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Fairness Focus:** I'm reiterating the fairness of my offer and highlighting the mutual benefits of the deal.
* **Midpoint Approach:** $925,000 is a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer, creating a sense of compromise.
* **Urgency Implication:**  By suggesting a ""win-win"" situation, I subtly imply that this might be the final offer, creating a sense of urgency.

This strategy aims to inch closer to my desired price while keeping the negotiations moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $925000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to pay $910000 for the product. Let's bridge the gap and make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but Not Enough:**  While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $910,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'm not willing to settle for a price that significantly undervalues the product.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I demonstrate my willingness to walk away if necessary, reinforcing my bargaining position. 
* **Possibility of a Better Deal:** There's still room for negotiation in the remaining rounds.  I'm hoping to push Bob closer to my target price.

The remaining rounds provide a chance to potentially reach a deal closer to my desired price.  Selling to John at this point would be a missed opportunity to potentially achieve a higher price with Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting very close.  $910,000 is a good offer, but I need to be at $915,000 to make this work for me. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from the product.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 915000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:** I'm only increasing my offer by a small amount, demonstrating my willingness to compromise and signal that I'm close to accepting.
* **Finality Implied:**  By stating ""Let's finalize this deal,"" I subtly suggest this might be my final offer, encouraging Bob to accept.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm once again reminding Bob of the value he'll get from the product to justify my price.

This counteroffer aims to push Bob to the brink of acceptance, knowing he's close to his desired price. This might create a sense of urgency and encourage him to close the deal in this round."
