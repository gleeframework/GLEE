"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity. However, $11,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250?",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still a bit stretched at $10,250. Would you be willing to go down to $9,800? It's a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to close the deal.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $9,800 is close, but I need to get a bit more for it.  Would you consider $10,000? That's my final offer.",10000.0,Alice,5,
