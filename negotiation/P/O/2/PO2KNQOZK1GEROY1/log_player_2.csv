Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a better price than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  He should try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering its value to you.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to his budget, it's still above his maximum of $8,000.  He should try to negotiate further or consider buying from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm ready to buy the product right now for $8,800. This is a fair price for both of us - it's significantly more than what I can get from John, and it's a good deal for you given your asking price. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 8800}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9500 is still a bit too high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8800. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $9200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200.

Bob should choose to buy from John. Alice's final offer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  It's better to secure the product from John at a lower price and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
