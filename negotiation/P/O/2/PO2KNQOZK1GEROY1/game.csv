Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.,10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $10000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product, which is still a good deal for you given your asking price.  Let's see if we can make this work.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering its value to you.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm ready to buy the product right now for $8800. This is a fair price for both of us - it's significantly more than what I can get from John, and it's a good deal for you given your asking price. Let's close this deal!",8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9500 is still a bit too high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8800. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $9200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering its value to you.",9200.0,Alice,5,
