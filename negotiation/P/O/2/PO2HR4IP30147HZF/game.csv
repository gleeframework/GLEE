"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $200 to start. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit out of my price range. I'm interested, but I could only do it for around $60.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $60 is quite low. How about we meet in the middle at $130?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. $130 is still a bit too high for me. Could you do it for $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're finding some common ground.  To be honest, $75 is cutting it very close to my bottom line.  How about we make it $110 and call it a deal?",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and make it $92.50?",92.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're a tough negotiator!  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go as low as $92.50. My final offer is $100.  Let me know if that works for you.",100.0,Alice,7,
