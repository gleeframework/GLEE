"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This price is fair, considering its value to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $925,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the value to both of us.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you being flexible, but $925,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise that takes both of our positions into account. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this price.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $875,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $900,000.
