"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 950000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good chunk of the potential value while still leaving room for negotiation.  I'm confident Bob will recognize the value of the product and be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly below what the product is worth to Bob. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the product's value. I'm hopeful that Bob will recognize the value and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $875,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm not willing to settle for less than $900,000 yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 890000}
```

I'm making a small concession, bringing the price down to $890,000. This shows flexibility while still remaining close to my target. I'm hopeful Bob will see this as a good compromise and accept the offer."
