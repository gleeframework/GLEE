Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I know it would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially worth $1,000,000 in the right hands. I'm willing to part with it for $925,000. This is a one-time offer, what do you say?"",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $1,000,000 as possible, knowing Bob's perceived value.
* **Negotiating Room:** Offering slightly below Bob's perceived value leaves room for him to feel like he's getting a deal while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Alternative Buyer:** The presence of John as a guaranteed backup buyer at $800,000 gives you leverage.  You're not desperate, so the offer to Bob should reflect that confidence."
