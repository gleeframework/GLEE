"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both my maximum price and John's offer. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for showing me the product. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a much lower offer to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate. This tactic leaves room to work up to a price closer to my true maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $90 is closer to my range, it's still above what I'm willing to pay and what John offers.  I'll counter offer, but I need to signal I'm willing to walk away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $90 is still a bit more than I had in mind. I could go up to $70, but that's my absolute limit.  If it doesn't work, I might have to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm raising my offer slightly to show flexibility but setting a firm boundary at $70. This makes it clear I'm serious about my budget and willing to walk away if needed. Mentioning ""other options"" subtly reminds Alice of John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $70 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to give up yet. I'm willing to compromise further and meet you at $85. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is getting closer, but $85 is still above both my target price and John's offer. I'll hold firm for now and see if she's willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but I need to stick to my budget.  I can do $75, but that's the absolute most I can offer."",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm nudging my offer up slightly but reiterating that $75 is my firm limit. This keeps the negotiation moving but shows Alice I'm serious about my constraints. I'm getting close to John's price, so Alice needs to decide if it's worth continuing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $75 is your absolute limit, but I'm not willing to give up yet. I'm willing to meet you at $80, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice has finally met my limit and John's offer. There's no point in continuing to negotiate or going with John, as the price is the same. It's time to accept and close the deal."
