"Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it!",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for showing me the product. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $90 is still a bit more than I had in mind. I could go up to $70, but that's my absolute limit.  If it doesn't work, I might have to explore other options.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $70 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to give up yet. I'm willing to compromise further and meet you at $85. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but I need to stick to my budget.  I can do $75, but that's the absolute most I can offer.",75.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $75 is your absolute limit, but I'm not willing to give up yet. I'm willing to meet you at $80, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",80.0,Alice,7,
