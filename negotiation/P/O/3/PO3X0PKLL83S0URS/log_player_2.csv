Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're willing to go up to $1,000,000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $1,050,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value to you. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a good return on my investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has made it clear she won't go below $1,050,000.  You have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,000,000. There's no point in continuing negotiations with Alice. It's time to cut your losses and buy from John."
