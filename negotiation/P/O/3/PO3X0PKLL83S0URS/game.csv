"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a good value for the product. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000.

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be honest, $1,000,000 is the highest I can go.  I'm ready to close the deal at that price if you're interested.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're willing to go up to $1,000,000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $1,050,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value to you. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a good return on my investment.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
