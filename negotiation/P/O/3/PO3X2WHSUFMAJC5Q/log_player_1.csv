This offer is a good balance between maximizing your profit and increasing the chances of Bob accepting. 

* **Why $14,000?**  
    * It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $10,000, allowing you to make a good profit.
    * It's lower than the product's value to Bob ($15,000), giving him a clear incentive to buy and still leaving him with a profit.
