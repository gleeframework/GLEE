Round 2
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:** Bob is very slowly approaching our minimum acceptable price. He's consistently splitting the difference.  At this rate, we risk ending up below our $1,200,000 minimum. John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, which is a better outcome than continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially ending up with less."
