"Alice's offer: The product price will be $999,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $999,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I'll choose option 2) Reject Alice's offer. I can get the same product for $800,000 from John, which is a better deal than Alice's offer.
