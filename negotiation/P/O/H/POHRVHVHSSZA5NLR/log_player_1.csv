Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.  If Bob rejects the offer, I have a guaranteed buyer in John who will purchase it for $1,500,000. This approach allows me to maximize my potential profit while still having a safety net."
