Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this price reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aiming for the highest price possible within Bob's potential acceptance range maximizes potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While a higher initial offer is ideal, starting at $14,000 leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Above Minimum Threshold:** The offered price is significantly above your minimum acceptable price ($12,000), ensuring a profitable sale."
