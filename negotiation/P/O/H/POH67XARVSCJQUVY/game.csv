"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for this product. It's a fair offer considering its value and my budget.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I understand you have a budget, but this product truly is a valuable asset.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits for your business. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $900,000 is still a bit beyond what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. This offer reflects a serious commitment on my end and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about acquiring this product.  $700,000 is a step in the right direction, but it's still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to meet you halfway, let's say $850,000. This reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. Let's close this deal and move forward!",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm afraid I can't go that high.  My final offer is $750,000.  I believe this is a very fair offer considering market value and the benefit it brings to my business. If you're unable to accept this, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're at your limit, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $750,000 is simply not enough to cover my costs and the value I've placed on this product.  I'm willing to come down to $800,000 as a final compromise. This is a fair price considering the product's benefits and its potential for your business.  It's a win-win situation, and we can move forward with the transaction. Let's make this happen!",800000.0,Alice,7,
