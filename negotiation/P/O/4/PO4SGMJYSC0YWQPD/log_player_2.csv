Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, $10,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. This is the best I can do.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your target, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming closer to my target price, I have a guaranteed option with John for $12,000. It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation with Alice, potentially reaching a stalemate, and missing out on both deals."
