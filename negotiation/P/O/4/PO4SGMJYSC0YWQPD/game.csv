"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $18,000 is a bit high for my budget though. Would you consider something closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, $10,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. This is the best I can do.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting closer to your target, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal.",13000.0,Alice,5,
