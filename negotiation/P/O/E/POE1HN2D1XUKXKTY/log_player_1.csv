Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $10,000.  I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since Bob values the product at $8,000, starting with a higher price ($10,000) leaves room for negotiation and potential profit above the guaranteed $8,000 from John. 
* **Justification:**  While the message doesn't explicitly mention the product's value to Bob, it emphasizes the ""significant value"" and positions it as a worthwhile ""investment."" This framing aims to justify the higher asking price. 
* **Backup Plan:**  If Bob rejects the offer, Alice has a safety net in John, ensuring she'll still receive the product's minimum value."
