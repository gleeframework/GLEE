Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate up, getting you closer to your true value. 
* **Creating Urgency:** Mentioning other interested buyers creates a sense of urgency, making Bob less likely to hesitate or lowball you.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while having the safety net of John's offer."
