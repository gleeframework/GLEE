"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be extremely valuable to your business. I understand its worth to you is significant, and I'm offering it to you at a price that reflects its potential.  I'm asking for $1,400,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll derive from it.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
