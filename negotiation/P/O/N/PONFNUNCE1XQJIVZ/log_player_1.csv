Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I've chosen $1,100,000 as my initial offer. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob.  It also opens the door for further discussion.

**Strategy:**

* **Be Realistic:**  I'm not starting with my highest possible price, but rather a price that's likely to be attractive to Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  This initial offer provides space for counteroffers and allows for a back-and-forth that could potentially lead to a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Protect My Interests:**  If Bob doesn't accept this offer, I'm prepared to engage in further negotiation or sell the product to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.** While it's closer than his previous offer, it's still not profitable enough for me.
* **I'm not willing to settle for a price that's below my minimum.** I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a better deal.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob.  I'll need to find a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price but still attractive enough to him that he'll consider it.  I'll also need to carefully consider the potential risks of continuing to negotiate with Bob. If the negotiation drags on, I may ultimately need to sell the product to John to avoid losing too much money."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective. However,  $1,050,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price for this product.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,125,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($1,100,000) and Bob's offer ($1,050,000). This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:**  I'm keeping the communication friendly and emphasizing the ""fairness"" of the offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While this offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still leaving some room for negotiation in case Bob wants to counter again.

**Strategy:**

* **Finding a compromise:** My goal is to reach a mutually agreeable price as quickly as possible.  This counteroffer shows my flexibility while maintaining a good negotiating position. 
* **Keeping the pressure on:**  By offering a price that's still above Bob's most recent offer, I'm putting the pressure on him to make a decision.  If he continues to counteroffer at a lower price, I may need to consider selling the product to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,125,000. I'd like to make a revised offer of $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, but also takes into account my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.**  While it's a slight improvement from his previous offer, it's still not enough for me to consider selling.
* **The negotiation has reached a point where continuing to bargain is unlikely to lead to a significantly better deal.** Bob's counteroffers are getting increasingly smaller, indicating he's nearing his limit. 
* **Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price.** This is the most reliable way to ensure I get the best possible outcome for the sale.

**Reasoning:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob is that the negotiation could drag on indefinitely, potentially leading me to accept a lower price than I'm comfortable with.  The reward of continuing to negotiate is that I might be able to secure a slightly higher price than John's offer.
* **Time is Money:**  Considering the time spent negotiating and the possibility of not reaching a deal with Bob, it's more advantageous to secure the guaranteed price from John.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the current situation and my desire to maximize my profit, I've decided to sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
