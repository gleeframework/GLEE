Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the details with you. I'm willing to offer you the product for $9,500. This is a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a competitive price. What do you think?

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to buy your product. However, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that you're looking to save some money, and I'm willing to compromise. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $9,000. This is a great price for a high-quality product like this, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price.  While $9,000 is better than John's price,  there's still potential to negotiate further.  Rejecting allows Bob to try to get a price closer to his initial counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $9,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about $8,750? This is a good middle ground that allows us both to get a fair deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,750 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another compromise to get this deal done. I'm willing to lower the price to $8,900. This is as low as I can go without losing money on the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,900 is within Bob's budget and is a better price than John's offer.  It's also very close to Bob's last counteroffer of $8,750.  At this point, it's reasonable to accept the offer to save time and potentially avoid further rounds of negotiation."
