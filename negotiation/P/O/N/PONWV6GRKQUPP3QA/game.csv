"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I'm offering for sale. I'm confident it's worth a lot to you. I'm initially asking for $150.  What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $80, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can you meet me in the middle at $100?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $80 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but  how about $120? It's a fair compromise and still allows me to make a reasonable profit.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $120 is not what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $80, so I'll counter with $110. Can you consider that?",110.0,Bob,4,
