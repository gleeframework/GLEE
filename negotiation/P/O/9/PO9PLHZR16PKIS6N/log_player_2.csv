# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value and your potential use cases, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have significant interest from another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
