"I have a unique opportunity for you, Bob. I'm willing to sell this valuable product to you at a price of $12000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've got to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11000. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $9000 is a fair price. I'm willing to go up to $10000, but no more than that. Can you meet me at $10000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go to $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10000 and my original offer of $12000. I'm thinking $11500 is a fair price. It's the highest I can go, and I think it's a great deal for you.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still thinking $10000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your previous offer of $11500, so I'll offer $11250. Can you consider that?",11250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $11250, but I need to make a bit more to make it worth my while. I'm thinking $11750 is the lowest I can go. It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11750.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still thinking $10000 is a fair price. I'll meet you halfway from your previous offer of $11750, so I'll offer $11375. Can you consider that?",11375.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit stuck, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $11375, but I need to make a bit more to make it worth my while. I'm thinking $11750 is the lowest I can go, but I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm going to make one more offer, and then I'll have to consider other options.",11750.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any higher than $11250, Alice. I think that's a fair price for the product. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",11250.0,Bob,10,
