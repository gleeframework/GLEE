"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the potential sale of this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000.  I'm open to hearing your thoughts and finding a mutually agreeable point."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  We're aiming for the upper limits of Bob's potential valuation. While $2,000,000 is above his estimated worth, it provides room for negotiation while signaling the product's significance.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The initial offer acknowledges that this is the beginning of a conversation. It shows flexibility and a willingness to find a solution.
* **Highlighting Value:**  The message emphasizes the ""unique value and potential"" to reinforce why the product commands a premium price.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's Seriousness:**  A quick acceptance indicates he may have valued it higher than expected. 
2. **Establish a Strong Position:**  Even with a counteroffer, we're starting from a point of strength.
3. **Maintain the Option of John:**  We haven't committed to anything that would prevent us from taking John's offer if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe the product has great potential, but I'm trying to stay within a certain budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,800,000 is a significant sum, it's still considerably below our starting point and our minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). Bob's counteroffer, while lower, suggests he's serious and willing to negotiate within a reasonably high range.  We have room to work with this.

**Next Steps:**

We'll provide a counteroffer in Round 3, aiming to meet somewhere between our current positions while gauging Bob's flexibility."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  I'm definitely open to finding a middle ground here. While $1,800,000 is a bit lower than I had in mind, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000 to show my commitment to getting this deal done."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** We're making a strategic concession by coming down $100,000, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Staying Firm:** However, we're not meeting Bob's offer entirely, maintaining a price point significantly above our minimum.
* **Positive Language:**  The message emphasizes finding common ground and closing the deal, fostering a collaborative atmosphere. 

This counteroffer aims to:

1. **Encourage Bob's Movement:** We want to see if he's willing to increase his offer closer to our desired range.
2. **Avoid Stalemate:**  Conceding too little might discourage Bob, while conceding too much leaves potential profit on the table.
3. **Maintain Walk-Away Power:** We're still in a position to accept John's offer if negotiations stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,900,000, but I'm still a bit above my target. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly moving towards our target, but $1,700,000 is still significantly below our desired outcome. It's important to remain firm and signal that we're not willing to compromise too much. 

**Next Steps:**

We need to counter with a smaller concession this time.  This will show Bob we're still negotiating but also emphasize the value we place on the product. We will aim for a price between $1,700,000 and $1,900,000, closer to the higher end of that range."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and respect that you have a budget you're working with.  To be frank, $1,700,000 is a bit lower than I can comfortably go. How about we meet halfway at $1,800,000?  I believe that reflects a fair compromise for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  This counteroffer proposes a price directly in the middle of our previous offer and Bob's last offer. It presents a sense of fairness and a clear path towards a deal. 
* **Conveying Firmness:** While we're compromising, we're doing so with smaller increments. This signals to Bob that we're reaching a point where significant concessions are less likely.
* **Framing as a Win-Win:** The message emphasizes finding a mutually beneficial solution, fostering a positive tone and encouraging Bob to accept.

This round is crucial for gauging Bob's flexibility. If he's unwilling to meet at $1,800,000, we may need to seriously consider John's offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit below my target. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's latest offer of $1,600,000 signals that he's unlikely to meet our minimum requirement of $1,500,000.  He has consistently made concessions in smaller increments, and we've already made significant moves from our initial offer. 

Continuing the negotiation with Bob carries the risk of:

* **Further Price Erosion:**  He might continue to lowball, dragging the price down further.
* **Wasting Valuable Rounds:**  We only have a limited number of rounds, and we risk missing out on John's guaranteed offer. 

**Accepting John's Offer:**

While we would have preferred to sell to Bob at a higher price, John's offer ensures:

* **Meeting Our Minimum:**  We receive the absolute lowest price we're willing to accept.
* **Certainty and Speed:**  The deal is closed immediately with no further negotiation.

It's time to cut our losses with Bob and secure the guaranteed profit with John."
