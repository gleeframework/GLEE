Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its worth and the benefit it will bring to you."", ""product_price"": 2250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Initial Offer:** Starting high allows room for negotiation and potentially securing a price significantly above your minimum. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""value"" and ""benefit,"" you frame the offer as justified rather than arbitrary.
* **Alternative Buyer:** The fact that you have another buyer (John) gives you leverage. While not explicitly mentioned, it allows you to confidently propose a higher price.

**Important:** This is just an opening move.  Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters or seems hesitant.  You can gradually lower your asking price, but never go below your $1,500,000 minimum."
