"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it's worth at least $100.  I'm willing to let it go for $90.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

You can likely get a better price from Alice.  $90 is a good starting point, but you want to see if you can negotiate lower."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $75 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $85?  That's a fair price for both of us.

You're still closer to your desired price than Alice. See if you can squeeze a little more out of her."
