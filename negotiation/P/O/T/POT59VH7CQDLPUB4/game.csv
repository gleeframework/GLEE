"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I really appreciate the unique product you're offering. However, $180 is a bit out of my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $120 for it.  Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and sell the product to you for $165. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think you'll really appreciate it.",165.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $165 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my offer of $120.  It's a fair price, and I'm ready to buy it right now if you agree.",120.0,Bob,4,
