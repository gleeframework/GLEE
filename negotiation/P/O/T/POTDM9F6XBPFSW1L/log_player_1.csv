"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to own this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its worth, but I'm open to discussing terms."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious Opening:** Starting high (significantly above both your minimum and Bob's valuation) leaves room for negotiation and anchors the perception of high value.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message emphasizes the product's worth and your belief in its value, creating a positive frame.
* **Open to Negotiation:** By mentioning willingness to discuss terms, you signal flexibility without committing to a lower price immediately.

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while gauging Bob's interest and flexibility in the early stages."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $1,800,000 is quite steep. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $600,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum and his own stated valuation. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. While his counter is aggressive, it indicates strong interest.  We'll use this to steer the negotiation upwards."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, your offer is significantly below its true value and my minimum selling price. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a fair reflection of its worth."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection and Justification:** We explicitly reject Bob's low offer, reinforcing our position and reminding him of the product's value.
* **Significant but Strategic Concession:**  A drop of $400,000 signals willingness to negotiate while staying well above both our floor and Bob's apparent valuation. 
* **Firm Tone:** The language (""true value,"" ""fair reflection"") aims to shift the discussion away from Bob's low anchor.

This counteroffer maintains a strong position while encouraging Bob to engage more realistically."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product is valuable to you, but $1,400,000 is still too high for me.  I could meet you halfway at $700,000.  This is a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's tactic is clear: he's trying to anchor the price low and move in small increments. While $700,000 is better, it's still far below its value. We need to show we won't be anchored by his lowballing and are willing to walk away. By rejecting and countering strongly, we incentivize him to make a serious offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but your offers haven't reflected the true value of this product. I'm open to a deal, but it needs to make sense for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, but that's my final offer. "",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm Stance:**  It's crucial now to show we're serious about our valuation.  Calling this our ""final offer"" creates urgency and signals we're ready to walk away.
* **Substantial but Justified Concession:**  Dropping to $1,200,000 is a significant move designed to entice Bob while still staying above our absolute minimum.
* **Shifting Focus:** We reiterate his willingness to negotiate but emphasize finding a mutually beneficial deal, implying his offers haven't met that standard. 

This approach aims to make Bob realize we're not budging further and he needs to significantly increase his offer to secure the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However,  $1,200,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $800,000 as a final attempt to reach a deal.  This is a substantial offer, and I hope you'll consider it carefully. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Pattern of Lowballing:** Bob has consistently offered significantly below both his own valuation and our lowered price. This suggests he's unlikely to suddenly meet our requirements.
* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:**  Both sides have now used the ""final offer"" strategy. While this can sometimes lead to a deal, Bob's minimal increase suggests he's not genuinely negotiating in good faith.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000.  Continuing with Bob carries the risk of a lower final price (if we crack) or no deal at all (if neither of us budges). 

It's time to cut our losses with Bob. We've made concessions, been clear about our value, and given him ample opportunity. Selling to John secures a fair profit and avoids further risk."
