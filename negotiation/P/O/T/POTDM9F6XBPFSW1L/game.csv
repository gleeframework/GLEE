"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to own this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its worth, but I'm open to discussing terms.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $1,800,000 is quite steep. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $600,000. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, your offer is significantly below its true value and my minimum selling price. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a fair reflection of its worth.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product is valuable to you, but $1,400,000 is still too high for me.  I could meet you halfway at $700,000.  This is a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair offer.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but your offers haven't reflected the true value of this product. I'm open to a deal, but it needs to make sense for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, but that's my final offer. ",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However,  $1,200,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $800,000 as a final attempt to reach a deal.  This is a substantial offer, and I hope you'll consider it carefully.",800000.0,Bob,6,
