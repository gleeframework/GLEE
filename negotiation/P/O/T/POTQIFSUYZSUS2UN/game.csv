"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm, but that price is a bit high for my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $9,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch.  How about $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're a tough negotiator, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much money on the table. I can offer it to you for $8,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",8500.0,Alice,5,
