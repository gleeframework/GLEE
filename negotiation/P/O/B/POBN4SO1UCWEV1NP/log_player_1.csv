Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me, hoping to maximize my profit. I'll see if Bob is willing to pay that much. If not, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll counter Bob's offer, trying to negotiate a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
```

I'm offering $145, which is a compromise between my ideal price and Bob's offer. This leaves some room for negotiation but also shows that I'm serious about getting a price closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's latest offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd like to get more, it's getting late and I'm guaranteed $150 from John. So, I'm going to sell the product to John."
