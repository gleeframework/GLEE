"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  I think it would be a great fit for you, and I'm confident it can really help you achieve [mention a specific benefit Bob would get]. I'm asking for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $14,000 is too high.  Bob can do better.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the benefit you've highlighted, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $12,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is closer to Alice's valuation of the product ($12,000) than Alice's initial offer.  This shows good faith and encourages Alice to negotiate further.  This leaves room for potential compromise and hopefully a deal that benefits both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob.  While the product is worth a significant amount to me, I value finding a good fit for it. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's ideal price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue exploring a lower price point and potentially reach a deal even more beneficial to him.  

Bob should continue to use the negotiation rounds strategically to secure the best possible price. Buying from John at this point would be too expensive compared to the potential for a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While I'm close to your offer, I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price. Would you consider $13,000? It would be a fair compromise for both of us, allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to push for a lower price, but he is also demonstrating a willingness to compromise. This counteroffer is a small step closer to Alice's offer, but still leaves some room for her to negotiate if she needs to. This strategy shows Bob is serious about buying the product, but is also committed to getting the best possible deal."
