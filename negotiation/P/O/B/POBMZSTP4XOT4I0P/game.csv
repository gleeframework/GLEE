"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $110?",110.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. How about we meet in the middle at $125? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",125.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob! However, I'm still a bit above my minimum price. How about we try $122? It's a small step up from your last offer, but I think it's still a fair compromise.",122.0,Alice,5,
