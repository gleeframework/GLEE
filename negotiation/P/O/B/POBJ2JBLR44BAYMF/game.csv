"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's something you've been looking for, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. My starting price is $1,750,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $1,200,000 is significantly lower than the product's value. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. Let's meet in the middle at $1,600,000. This allows both of us to benefit from the deal.  What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we split the difference from our last offers and settle at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there yet.  $1,400,000 is a good offer, but I'm hoping to get closer to $1,500,000. Let's compromise at $1,450,000. It's a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
