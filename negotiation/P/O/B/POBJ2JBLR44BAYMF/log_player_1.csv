Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll see if I can get him up to $1,500,000 in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there yet.  $1,400,000 is a good offer, but I'm hoping to get closer to $1,500,000. Let's compromise at $1,450,000. It's a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
