Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price, hoping to get as close to my value of $12,000 as possible. This is a bold move, but it sets the stage for a strong negotiation.  If Bob rejects, we'll have to see if he's willing to come closer to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to sell for less than $12,000, and I believe I can negotiate a better price with Bob. I will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from my initial offer, but still staying above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping this shows Bob I'm serious about making a deal, but also that I won't be swayed by his low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer a price closer to my $12,000 valuation, Bob's offer of $10,000 is now at his maximum value for the product.  Accepting this offer means securing a sale that is within a reasonable range of my desired price and avoids the risk of further negotiation or having to sell to John for a lower price."
