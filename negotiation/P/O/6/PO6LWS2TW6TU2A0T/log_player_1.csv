Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product for $13,000. It's in excellent condition and I believe it's a great deal for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $13,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive message:** I'm framing the offer positively, highlighting the value and potential deal for Bob.
* **Flexibility:** I'm prepared to negotiate if Bob rejects the initial offer. 
* **John as a backup:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $12,000 gives me a safety net if negotiations with Bob fall apart."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm not willing to go above $12,000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $10,000 is significantly below my minimum price of $12,000. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation is possible:** While Bob has a clear upper limit of $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. He's willing to pay a premium, suggesting a potential middle ground.
* **John is a safety net:**  I can always sell to John for $12,000 if negotiations with Bob break down. 

I will counteroffer Bob in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I can't go as low as $10,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's settle at $11,000. This gives you a good deal and still allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway, suggesting I'm willing to negotiate but not at the expense of my minimum value.
* **Emphasis on the deal:** I'm highlighting the benefits for Bob by mentioning ""a good deal.""
* **Fairness:** I'm aiming for a price that feels fair to both of us, creating a potential for a successful agreement. 
* **Open to further discussion:** I'm keeping the door open for further negotiation by asking ""What do you say?"""
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $10,500? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While he's closer to my minimum price, $10,500 is still below my desired value and leaves me with a very small profit margin.
* **Limited negotiation space:**  Bob's statement about his budget suggests he's unlikely to go higher.
* **John's offer is secure:**  Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees me my minimum desired profit without any further risk or negotiation.

Given the current situation, selling to John is the most logical and financially sound decision."
