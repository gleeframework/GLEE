Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth at least $10,000, but I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:** By mentioning that the product is worth at least $10,000, you're anchoring Bob's perception of its value. 
* **Urgency:**  Hinting that there's another buyer (John) creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quicker.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential earnings while still offering Bob a price he might consider reasonable given the product's value to him."
