"Hi Bob, I'm excited to sell you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $100. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $85 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we settle on $92?",92.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, Alice.  How about we agree on $88 and call it a deal?",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. How about we try $95?",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we're going back and forth here. To be honest, $88 is the absolute highest I'm willing to pay. If you're not able to accept that, I understand, but I might need to explore other options.",88.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a fair deal, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $92. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. How about I include a free accessory worth $10, and we meet at $90?",90.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer with the accessory, but I'm really trying to stick to a tight budget. If you're willing to go down to $88, I'm ready to close the deal right now. Otherwise, I need to seriously consider my other option.",88.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stick to a tight budget, Bob, but I've already given you a great deal with the accessory. I'm willing to go down to $89, but that's as low as I can go. If you're still interested, let's make it happen.",89.0,Alice,9,
