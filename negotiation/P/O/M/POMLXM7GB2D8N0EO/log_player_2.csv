(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,200,000.  I will reject and counteroffer to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $850,000. I believe this is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is closer to my ideal price, it's still above my preferred range. I'll continue negotiating and try to push Alice down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is closer to what I can afford. I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go down to $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $825,000. I believe this is the best price we can agree on, considering the value of the product to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $825,000 is getting closer to my ideal price, it's still higher than I'd like. I'm confident that I can get a better price if I continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $825,000 is still outside of my budget. Let's find a middle ground.  I'm prepared to offer $810,000. This would be a win-win situation for both of us.  I'm ready to close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 810000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go down to $810,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $820,000. I believe this is the best price we can agree on, considering the value of the product to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $820,000, which is close enough to my ideal price that I'm willing to accept the offer.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that she'll reject my next counteroffer and I'll be forced to buy from John at a much higher price.  It's better to lock in this deal and save $380,000 compared to buying from John."
