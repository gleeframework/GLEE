"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer you $750,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $850,000. I believe this is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product to me.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is closer to what I can afford. I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go down to $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $825,000. I believe this is the best price we can agree on, considering the value of the product to me.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $825,000 is still outside of my budget. Let's find a middle ground.  I'm prepared to offer $810,000. This would be a win-win situation for both of us.  I'm ready to close the deal at this price.",810000.0,Bob,6,
