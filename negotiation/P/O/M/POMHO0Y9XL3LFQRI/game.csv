"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be of immense value to you.  Given its unique features and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,400,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which reflects the value I see in it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product.  While $1,200,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
