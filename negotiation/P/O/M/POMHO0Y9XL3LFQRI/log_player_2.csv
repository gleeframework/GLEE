"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be of immense value to you.  Given its unique features and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,400,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While it's lower than John's price, it's still above what the product is worth to Bob ($1,000,000).
* **Potential for negotiation:** There's room for negotiation, and Bob can try to get a better price.
* **Counteroffer strategy:**  Bob should aim for a counteroffer closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which reflects the value I see in it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product.  While $1,200,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,300,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is closer to Bob's target:**  $1,300,000 is a significant improvement over Alice's initial offer and brings the price closer to Bob's target price.
* **Negotiation is likely to continue:**  While Bob could counteroffer again, there's a risk that Alice will reject it and the price could end up higher.
* **Avoiding John's higher price:** Accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $200,000 compared to buying from John."
