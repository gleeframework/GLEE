,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice!  $15000 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  How about $10000?  I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. How about we meet in the middle at $13000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  $13000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Let's try $11500. This would be a fair price for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable going as low as $11500, Bob. How about we compromise at $12800?",12800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really interested in this product and I want to make this work, but $12800 is still a bit too high. Would you consider $12500? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the purchase.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting, Bob, but I still think the product is worth more than $12500. How about we meet at $13200?",13200.0,Alice,7,
