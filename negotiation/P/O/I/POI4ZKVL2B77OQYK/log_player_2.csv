"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above my budget. It's much more worthwhile to try and negotiate with Alice. There are 9 rounds remaining, so there is plenty of time to try and find a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget price. This establishes my boundary and shows Alice that I'm serious about getting a good deal.  It's unlikely Alice will accept this offer right away, but it's a good starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, and I still have 7 rounds left to try and negotiate a better price. I'm going to try and push her closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from my initial counteroffer, showing flexibility. $10,000 is still a significant discount from Alice's last offer, but it's closer to the middle ground.  This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still holding firm on my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $15,000 is a much better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my budget. I have 5 rounds left to try and push Alice closer to my desired price. I believe there's room for further negotiation and I'm not ready to settle just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm gradually increasing my counteroffers, showing Alice that I'm willing to meet halfway. $12,000 is still significantly less than Alice's last offer but shows a willingness to compromise. With 4 rounds remaining, there is still time to push for a lower price but it's getting closer to the point where it might be more beneficial to accept a slightly higher price than risk losing the deal altogether."
