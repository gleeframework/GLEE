Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $142.50. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to sell it to you for $155. It's a fair price, considering the value the product brings. What do you think?

We're getting close, but it's still worth trying to get the price down further. Alice is showing signs of being willing to negotiate."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I see you're still interested in the product! I can do $152, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal for you, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $152. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $152

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go any lower, and at this point, it's more cost-effective to buy from John for $150 rather than haggling over a $2 difference."
