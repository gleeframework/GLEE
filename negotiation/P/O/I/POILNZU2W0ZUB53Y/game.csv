"Hi Alice, thanks for offering! While the product looks great, $180 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 was a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I can meet you in the middle at $165. Would you be willing to consider that?",165.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we split the difference and settle at $142.50?",142.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $142.50. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to sell it to you for $155. It's a fair price, considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for understanding. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $148.75?",148.75,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're still interested in the product! I can do $152, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal for you, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",152.0,Alice,7,
