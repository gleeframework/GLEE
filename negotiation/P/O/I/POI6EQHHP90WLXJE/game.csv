"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the unique value of this product, $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it,  which is still a good price for something so special. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $20000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $18000. It's a compromise that I'm willing to make to find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18000 is still a little too high for me. I'm happy to pay $14000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. Let's find a way to make this work for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $18000 is still a stretch for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. How about we meet at $16500? It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $16500 is still outside my budget. I'm happy to pay $15000, which is a good compromise and represents a significant discount from your initial offer.  I hope you'll consider this final offer.",15000.0,Bob,6,
