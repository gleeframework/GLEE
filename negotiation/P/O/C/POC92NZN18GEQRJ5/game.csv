"Alice, your offer is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $800000 at this time. This is my maximum, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $800000 is significantly lower than what I need, I'm willing to come down to $1200000. This reflects the product's unique value while also acknowledging your financial limitations. Let's find a middle ground.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1200000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $800000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can reach a deal.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're firm on your offer.  However, $800000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1000000.  This is a fair price that allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's work together to close this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1000000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. My final offer remains at $800000. This is the absolute maximum I can afford. I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product.  Please let me know if you're willing to accept.",800000.0,Bob,6,
