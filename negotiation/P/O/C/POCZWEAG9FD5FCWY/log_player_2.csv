"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $130. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reasoning:  While $130 is a good price, it's still higher than Alice's perceived value of $100. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $130 is a bit high for me. How about $115? I'm really interested in the product, and this price would be fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $122? It's a really great product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Reasoning:  $122 is a good compromise and falls within my budget of $150. It's also a bit higher than Alice's perceived value of $100, which suggests she might be willing to negotiate further if I reject the offer. However,  the risk of further negotiation could lead to a higher price or a deal falling through entirely.  It's better to secure the product at a reasonable price than risk getting a higher price from John."
