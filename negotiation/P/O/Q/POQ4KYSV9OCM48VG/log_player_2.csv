"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,800,000. I'm open to discussing this further. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. While the product holds significant value, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it is still above Bob's maximum value. Bob should reject the offer and continue to negotiate for a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $1,400,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking to my initial offer of $1,000,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we have different valuations in mind. I'm willing to come down slightly further to $1,250,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a very fair price considering the potential of this product.  Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice's final offer of $1,250,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Since Bob can purchase the same product from John for $1,000,000, it's in his best interest to accept John's offer and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
