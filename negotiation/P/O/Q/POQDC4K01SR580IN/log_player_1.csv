"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm starting high with $1,000,000. This is a bold opening offer that sets a high bar for the negotiation. It's important to remember that Bob's value for the product is unknown, so aiming high initially is a good strategy to maximize potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my ideal price, I believe there's room for further negotiation, and I'm not yet ready to settle. I'll aim for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm offering $950,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above Bob's offer, signaling that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again.  While $900,000 is a good price, I'm still holding out for a slightly higher amount. I want to see if I can push for that extra $50,000 before I consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 930000} 
```

I'm offering $930,000. This is a smaller concession than before, signaling that I'm getting closer to my bottom line.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be more inclined to consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $920,000 is close to my minimum, I still believe there's potential to get a little closer to my ideal price. With only 4 rounds left, I need to strike a balance between holding out and settling for a good deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000} 
```

I'm offering $925,000. This is a small compromise, but I'm running out of time and need to get closer to a deal.  I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to accept and avoid having to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds remaining, Bob's offer of $910,000 is still below my ideal price. I'm not confident I can close a better deal in the remaining rounds.  It's time to secure the guaranteed $800,000 from John."
