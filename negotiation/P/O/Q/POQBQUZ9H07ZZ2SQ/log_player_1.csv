Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer. This sets the stage for a negotiation and allows me to potentially earn more than the $1,500,000 I would get from John. I'm confident that even if Bob counteroffers, I can still negotiate a price that's more favorable than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I value the product at.  I believe I can still get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,500,000. This is still above Bob's offer, but it demonstrates my willingness to negotiate. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come up in his price, potentially leading to a deal that's closer to what I want.  It also sets a clear line in the sand â€“ anything below this price is unacceptable, and I'm willing to walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob has moved up slightly, but it's still not enough. At this point, the negotiations are becoming time-consuming and it's unlikely that Bob will significantly raise his offer. I'm going to take the sure thing and sell to John.  While it's not the ideal price, it's still a good deal and guarantees I get what I value the product at."
