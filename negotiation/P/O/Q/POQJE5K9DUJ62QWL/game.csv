"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $9,500 is too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $11,000? This is still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $10,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,4,
