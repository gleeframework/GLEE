{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I think it's fair given its value to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum value, but leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but if not, I'm prepared to counter-offer and potentially even deal with John if the price becomes too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I would prefer selling to Bob, I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum value of $12,000. I will make a counteroffer and try to reach a price that's more favorable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $11,000 is unfortunately below my minimum asking price. I'm willing to go down to $12,500, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd love to get more, I don't want to risk losing the sale and having to settle with John for the same price."
