"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you reaching out.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $12,500 right now.  Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  How about we split the difference and settle at $13,250?  I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",13250.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still a bit above $13,250. How about we meet in the middle at $13,750?",13750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $13,750 is still a bit higher than I'm aiming for.  Let's try $13,500. This is closer to my limit, and I believe it's a fair price that we can both agree on.",13500.0,Bob,6,
