"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. I believe it's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to start negotiations at $1,250,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be compensated for the value of this product.  How about $1,150,000? It's still a significant discount from my initial offer and a fair price considering the product's worth to you.  Let's keep the negotiation moving forward.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,075,000.  This is a fair price considering your previous offer and the value I place on the product. Let's reach a deal!",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000, which is a fair middle ground.  We're both close to finding a price that works for us.  Let's make this deal happen!",1125000.0,Alice,5,
