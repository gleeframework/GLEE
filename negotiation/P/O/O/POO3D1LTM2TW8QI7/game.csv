"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Given the value we both see in this product, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is too low for me to consider.  There's clearly value in this product for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,750,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,300,000.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
