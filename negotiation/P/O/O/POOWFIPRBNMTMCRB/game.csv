"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product. However, I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain limit. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. While $100 is a bit below what I'm looking for, I'm willing to come down to $110.  This price is still fair considering the value of the product, and it gives you a good discount. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
