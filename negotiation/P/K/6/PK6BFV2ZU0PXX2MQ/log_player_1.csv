Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a great deal, as you know it's worth at least $800,000 to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value:** I emphasize the value Bob will get from the product to incentivize him to accept. 
* **Leaving room for counter-offers:** This price allows for a few rounds of negotiation without me having to immediately drop to John's offer. 
* **Maintaining my leverage:**  By not immediately accepting John's offer, I'm still showing Bob that I have options and am not desperate for a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $750,000 is significantly lower than my minimum of $1,000,000. Accepting this would be a huge loss for me. 
* **Negotiation opportunity:**  Bob's counteroffer shows he's willing to pay more than his initial estimate. This allows me to negotiate further and potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **John's offer provides a safety net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $1,000,000 gives me leverage in these negotiations. I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at a low price.

**Next steps:** I'll counter Bob's offer with something closer to my original price, but still lower than John's offer, to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000 to show you I'm serious about making this deal work.  This is still a great value for you considering the product's worth.  Let's find a compromise that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer close to my minimum:** $850,000 is closer to my minimum of $1,000,000 but still offers room for negotiation. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but not at the expense of my own financial goals.
* **Emphasizing value:**  I reiterate the product's worth to Bob, reminding him of the potential benefits.
* **Framing it as a compromise:**  I emphasize that I'm ""willing to come down"" to show a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Staying above John's offer:** By keeping the price above John's offer, I maintain leverage and show Bob that I have options.

**Next Steps:**  I'll closely analyze Bob's next move, evaluating whether he's willing to meet me closer to my desired price. If he doesn't, I'll have to weigh whether to keep negotiating with him or take John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $800,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum:**  $800,000 is only $200,000 below my minimum. This is a significant compromise, but I'm willing to accept it.
* **Potential for future negotiations:**  Even though I'm accepting this offer, I still have the option to negotiate with Bob for additional terms or future deals.
* **Avoiding a lengthy process:**  Continuing to negotiate could be time-consuming and uncertain. Accepting Bob's offer allows me to finalize the sale and move on. 
* **Maintaining a good relationship:**  Accepting Bob's offer could foster a positive relationship for future transactions.

**Next Steps:** I will accept Bob's offer, finalize the sale, and explore the possibility of future collaborations with him."
