"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000.  I believe this reflects its worth and the benefits you'll gain.",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to negotiate, but $9,000 is too low for this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? This recognizes its value while still offering you a fair deal.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $10,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value.",10500.0,Bob,4,
