"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  We begin significantly above both your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value and potential,"" subtly justifying the high initial price.
* **Leaving Room for John:** While we aim high, we're not going for an absurd number. We want to entice Bob to negotiate while keeping in mind that we have a guaranteed $1,500,000 from John if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $1,500,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches your minimum acceptable price, it's important to remember that he values the product at $1,000,000. There's still room for negotiation to secure a better deal.  We'll use the remaining rounds to try and push the price higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the price you proposed doesn't fully reflect the product's true value and potential for your business.  I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair price that considers both its worth and your potential return on investment."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a significant decrease from our initial offer to show flexibility and encourage Bob's engagement. 
* **Holding Firm:** However, we're still well above both your minimum and Bob's perceived value, maintaining a strong negotiating position.
* **Highlighting Value:**  The message reinforces the product's benefits specifically for Bob's business, aiming to justify the higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I must stay within my budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,750,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now getting closer to your minimum, but we're still in a favorable position. With 6 rounds left, there's room to negotiate further and aim for a price closer to $1,900,000 or higher. We'll continue to counter-offer strategically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  Your offer is tempting, but to be frank, anything under $1,900,000 wouldn't justify the loss of other opportunities this product presents. I'm confident it can generate significant returns for your business at that price."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** We're holding firm at $1,900,000, signaling this is close to our limit while still offering a price above Bob's perceived value.
* **Transparency and Scarcity:**  We're subtly introducing the idea of ""other opportunities"" to create a sense of scarcity and value.
* **Focus on ROI:** We're reiterating the product's potential to benefit Bob's business, emphasizing the return on investment at our proposed price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your continued willingness to negotiate. Considering the value and potential benefits of the product, I would like to propose a final price of $1,850,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** Bob has increased his offer significantly and is now very close to our $1,900,000 target. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** While we could try to push for more, the potential gains are likely small at this point. Further negotiation might risk Bob backing out altogether. 
* **Time Value:**  We've secured a price well above our minimum and John's offer. Accepting now provides a good return and allows us to move forward."
