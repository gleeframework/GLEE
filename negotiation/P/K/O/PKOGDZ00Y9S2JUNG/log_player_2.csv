"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product at a special price of $1,200,001. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,001. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,001
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,001 is below your maximum budget, it's only slightly less than what John is offering. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better deal, potentially pushing her closer to her own valuation of $1,200,000."
