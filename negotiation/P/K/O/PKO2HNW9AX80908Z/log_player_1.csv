Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $150, there's a chance to get more from Bob.
* **Find a Middle Ground:** Bob values the product at $120, and I value it at $150 minimum. Offering it at $135 splits the difference and might be tempting enough for Bob to accept.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While this is my initial offer, there's always a chance Bob might try to negotiate a lower price. Starting at $135 leaves some wiggle room."
