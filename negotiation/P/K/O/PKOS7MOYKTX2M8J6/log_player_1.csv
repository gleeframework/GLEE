``` 

This offer is slightly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and accept the offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $7,000.  Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $8,000. I'm going to counter his offer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm getting closer to my budget, but $8,500 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,750?  That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm happy Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $7,750 is still below my minimum threshold of $8,000. I'm going to counter his offer once again and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $7,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $8,250.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I hope we can finally come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8250}
