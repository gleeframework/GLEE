"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's goal is to save money.
* Alice's offer is $150, which is the maximum Bob is willing to pay.
* John is also selling the product for $150. 
* Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John will result in the same price, but keeps the option open for potentially finding a better deal later."
