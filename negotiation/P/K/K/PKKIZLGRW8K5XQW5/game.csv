"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $1,000,000 to you. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $800,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $700,000. This is a great compromise, considering its worth $1,000,000 to you. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While the product is good, I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you be willing to go down to $600,000? That would be a comfortable price point for me.",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you at $650,000, which is a significant discount from my original offer. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value. What do you think?",650000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. I'm getting closer to what I can afford. Could you do $620,000? I think that's a fair deal for both of us.",620000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $620,000. I'm willing to meet you at $630,000, which is a small discount from my original offer.
