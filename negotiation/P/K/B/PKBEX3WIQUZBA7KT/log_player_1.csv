Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  This is a great deal for you, as the product is worth $800,000 to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value for Bob to make the offer more appealing.
* **Leaving Room:** I'm not going all the way down to $800,000, as I need to secure a profit. 
* **Prepared for John:** I have a safety net with John's $1,200,000 offer, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand that the product is valuable to you, but given its worth to me is only $800,000, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise considering the value I place on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Higher Value:**  While $900,000 is better than Bob's initial $800,000 offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation:** I want to continue the negotiation to potentially push Bob closer to my desired price point. 
* **John's Offer:**  I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $1,200,000, giving me a strong position in negotiations. 

I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective on the value,  $900,000 is still below what I need to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but  I need to be closer to $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? "", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer but making it clear I'm not accepting it yet. 
* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by moving closer to his offer but still significantly above his initial price.
* **Middle Ground:** I'm framing the offer as a ""meeting in the middle"" to create a sense of fairness.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to justify my price point. 
* **Still Above Minimum:**  $950,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, giving me room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to go above $850,000 for this product. I believe this price is fair and within our previous discussions. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $850,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation Stalemate:** We seem to be at an impasse.  Further negotiation is unlikely to get me closer to my desired price.
* **Secure Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $1,200,000, which is much more appealing than accepting Bob's offer.  

While I'm disappointed that the negotiation with Bob didn't work out, I'm happy to secure the sale with John and maximize my profits."
