"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $20,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I believe this price is more reasonable and reflects the value I'm willing to pay for the product.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to negotiate, but $17,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll make a counteroffer of $14,000. I hope we can come to an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,4,
