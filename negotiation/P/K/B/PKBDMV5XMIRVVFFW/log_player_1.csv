Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $20,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I believe this price is more reasonable and reflects the value I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $17,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to negotiate, but $17,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll make a counteroffer of $14,000. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

This is a good time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Profitable:** $14,000 is a significant profit above your minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Trend:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing negotiations has an opportunity cost. Accepting now secures the deal and avoids potential delays."
