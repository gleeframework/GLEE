"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to us, but we're willing to negotiate. Let's start with a price of $90. We believe this is a fair offer considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum price point of $100.** You're aiming to save money, so accepting this offer wouldn't be ideal.
* **You have room to negotiate.** There are 10 rounds, giving you ample time to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price. 
* **Buying from John is always an option, but you want to try and get a lower price first.** 

**Next steps:** You'll make a counteroffer to Alice in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on your product, $90 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $85. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a reasonable counteroffer:** You're offering $5 less than Alice's initial price, showing your willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for further bargaining.
* **Be polite and express interest:**  This builds a positive rapport and keeps the negotiation open. 
* **State your price clearly:** Ensure Alice understands your offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We appreciate your interest in our product. Considering your offer, we would like to counter with a price of $95. This allows us to maintain a reasonable profit while still being competitive in the market. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still above your maximum price point.**  While it's a slight decrease from her initial offer, $95 is still too expensive for you.
* **You still have time to negotiate.**  There are 7 rounds remaining, giving you opportunities to continue lowering the price.
* **Buying from John is always an option, but you're closer to your target price with Alice.**  You can potentially get a better deal with Alice if you keep negotiating.

**Next steps:** You'll need to make another counteroffer to Alice in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $95 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really serious about getting this product, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's try $90. This would be a fair price, allowing you to make a profit while I get a great deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stay firm but polite:**  You're reiterating your interest in the product but sticking to your price point. 
* **Offer a compromise:**  $90 is a middle ground between your previous offer and Alice's last offer, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate. 
* **Highlight the benefits for Alice:**  You're reminding her that a $90 sale would still allow her to make a profit."
