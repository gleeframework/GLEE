Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you on the budget, but $75 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85.  This is a final offer. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $85, and it's better to secure the product at the known $80 price from John than risk exceeding your budget."
