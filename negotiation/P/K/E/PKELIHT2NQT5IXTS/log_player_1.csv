Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?"", ""product_price"": 10500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $10,500 is the best price for this product. I'd be willing to go up to $9,800, but I think that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach $10,000.  It makes more sense to take the guaranteed offer from John."
