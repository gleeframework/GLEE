Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's well worth the price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000 but lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential counteroffers.
* **Positive framing:** My message is positive and encouraging, aiming to build rapport with Bob. 
* **Backup option:** I have John as a backup buyer, so I'm not under pressure to accept any offer below my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I can only pay up to $10000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $10,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  There's a chance I can get closer to my desired price by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer.
* **John as a safety net:**  I'm not under pressure to accept Bob's offer because I can always sell to John for $15,000.

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, as a compromise.  This price still leaves room for you to get a great deal, while also ensuring I can make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but making a counter-offer to show flexibility and keep the negotiation going.
* **Moving closer:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer by dropping the price to $11,000, but still staying above my minimum.
* **Finding a middle ground:** I'm aiming to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us.
* **Positive language:** I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to consider my offer.

**Next steps:**

I'm waiting for Bob's response to my counteroffer. Based on his response, I will decide whether to accept or reject his next offer, or if I should sell the product to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $10500. This price allows me to stay within my budget while still being a competitive offer for you. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $10,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **John's offer is significantly better:** Selling to John for $15,000 is a much more profitable option.
* **Risk of further concessions:** There's a risk that if I continue negotiating, Bob might not increase his offer significantly, and I could end up with a price closer to his initial offer, which is far from what I want.

**Next Steps:**

Given that I have a much better option with John, I'm going to reject Bob's offer and proceed to sell the product to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $11,250.  This price reflects the value of the product and also allows you to get a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but making a counter-offer to show flexibility and keep the negotiation going.
* **Finding a middle ground:**  I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer ($11,000) and Bob's offer ($10,500). 
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm reminding Bob that the product has value, justifying my higher price.
* **Staying above my minimum:**  While this offer is still below my ideal price, it's above my minimum and still a profitable deal for me.

**Next steps:**

I'm waiting for Bob's response to my counteroffer. If he rejects it, I'll proceed to sell the product to John for $15,000."
