Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm going to start by offering the product for my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  This gives Bob the chance to accept if he's willing to pay that much. If not, we can negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to sell for $10,000, so I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round of negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm going to counter with $11,500. This is still above Bob's offer, but it's a compromise that might be more appealing to him.  It also gives me some wiggle room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly not willing to pay more than $10,000, and I'm not willing to go that low.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay my minimum price, I'm going to sell to John and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
