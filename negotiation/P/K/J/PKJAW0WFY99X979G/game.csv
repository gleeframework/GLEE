"Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,200,000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I need to be sure the price reflects the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We understand your concerns about the price, but we're not willing to go as low as $1,200,000. We're willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably pay.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.  This shows my commitment to acquiring this product, but it also reflects my budget limitations.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
