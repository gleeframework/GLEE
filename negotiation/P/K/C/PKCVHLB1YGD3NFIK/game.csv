"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, I'm unable to meet your asking price.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let's see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet somewhere in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What are your thoughts?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still slightly above my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000.  I believe this price reflects the product's value to me and allows us both to walk away satisfied.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'll counter with $1,000,000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to revisiting the price if you're willing to meet me at this point.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
