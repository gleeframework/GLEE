```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet somewhere in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What are your thoughts?

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still slightly above my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000.  I believe this price reflects the product's value to me and allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'll counter with $1,000,000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to revisiting the price if you're willing to meet me at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has finally reached my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While I could technically buy from John at this price, I want to see if I can close the deal with Alice.  There's a chance she might be willing to negotiate further in the future if I reject this offer. However, accepting this offer ensures I get the product at my maximum price, and there's always the risk of losing the deal entirely."
