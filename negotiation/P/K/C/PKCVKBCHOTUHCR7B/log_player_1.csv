Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would significantly benefit you, and I'm willing to part with it for $925,000. This offer stands until [set a reasonable deadline], after which it will no longer be available."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Knowing the product's value to Bob ($1,000,000) and my minimum acceptable price ($800,000), I aim high to maximize potential profit. 
* **Negotiation room:** The $925,000 offer leaves space for Bob to negotiate, making him feel more in control of the deal. 
* **Deadline:**  A deadline creates urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly and potentially avoid losing out on a valuable product. 
* **Alternative buyer (John) as leverage:**  While not explicitly mentioned, the presence of John as a backup buyer provides a safety net. I'm not desperate, which strengthens my position.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing a deal with Bob, who represents a higher potential return than John."
