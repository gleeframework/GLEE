Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that you've expressed interest in.  I'm offering it to you for $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($120) but still below my minimum ($150). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:** Using a friendly tone helps build rapport and potentially increase the likelihood of a deal. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message explicitly states that I'm open to hearing Bob's thoughts, which signals willingness to negotiate. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! I've made a profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counter-counteroffer. 
* If the negotiation stalls, I can always fall back to selling to John for my minimum price of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested, but $135 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $125?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $125 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation:**  While I want to make a sale, I'm not desperate. I can still potentially get closer to my target price by counter-offering.
* **John's Offer:**  I have a guaranteed buyer in John, offering me $150.  This gives me leverage in negotiations.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counter-offer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate.  $125 is a bit lower than I can go right now, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about $130?  This would still be a good deal for both of us, and it would help me cover some of my costs."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise, showing flexibility while still staying above Bob's initial counteroffer.
* **Justification:** I'm giving a reason for my counteroffer (covering costs), making it sound more logical.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I emphasize that a $130 price is a good deal for both of us.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a sale at a price closer to my target.
* If Bob rejects, I'll have to assess whether to make another counteroffer, or move on to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand you need to cover your costs, but $130 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $128. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $128 is still very close to my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Further negotiation might only yield a small increase in profit.
* **Time Factor:**  Each round of negotiation takes time and effort.  It's possible that continuing to negotiate could take longer than I'm willing to wait.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  John offers a guaranteed $150, which is a significantly better profit margin than Bob's offer.

**Next Steps:**

* I will accept John's offer, ending the negotiation with Bob. This guarantees me a sale at my minimum price, maximizing my profit and saving time."
