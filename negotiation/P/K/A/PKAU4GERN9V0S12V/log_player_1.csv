"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I have a limited budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than Bob's initial value assessment of $8,000, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I have 10 rounds, and there's potential to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $10,500. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is closer to my desired price than Bob's previous offer, it's still not ideal. I have 6 rounds remaining. There's still potential to get closer to my goal of $15,000. I'm not willing to sell to John yet because his offer is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I'm still not quite there yet.  $10,000 is closer, but I need to be at least $11,000 to make this work for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  It's a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not comfortable with $11,000, Alice. I think I can do $9,500, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. I really want to make this deal work, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $9,500 is still significantly lower than my desired price range, and we're now in Round 6.  I've already made multiple concessions, and there's a good chance that Bob will continue to lowball me in the remaining rounds.  Selling to John at $15,000 is the best option to maximize my earnings.  I'm confident I can get my minimum price point with John, and it's time to move on from this negotiation."
