Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product that I believe you'll find very valuable. I'm asking for $95, which I think is a fair price considering its worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

Here's why this offer makes sense:

* **Maximizes Potential Profit:**  Bob is willing to pay $100, so aiming high initially allows you to potentially secure the maximum profit.
* **Leaves Room for Negotiation:** Even if Bob counters, you have space to negotiate down to a price above your minimum ($80) and still make a good deal. 
* **Avoids Lowballing:**  Starting too low might make Bob think the product is less valuable. 

This strategy balances your desire for maximum profit with the understanding that you have a reliable backup offer from John."
