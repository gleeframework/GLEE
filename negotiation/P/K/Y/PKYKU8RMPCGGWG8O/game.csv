"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the value.  To be fair to both of us, I could meet you halfway between our offers at $12,750. This price reflects the true value of the product. What do you think?",12750.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $11,500? I think that's a reasonable compromise, and I'm willing to make a commitment to purchase the product at this price. What do you think?",11500.0,Bob,4,
