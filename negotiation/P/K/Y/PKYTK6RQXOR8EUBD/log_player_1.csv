I'm starting with an offer of $12,000. This is a good starting point because it's halfway between my minimum price of $10,000 and the estimated value of the product to Bob ($15,000). This gives Bob a good incentive to negotiate, while still ensuring I get a decent profit.  I'll see how he responds and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low for me. I can do better than that. I'll reject his offer and send a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $11,500. This is a slight increase from Bob's offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm hoping this will show Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair price while also being willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500

Bob's offer is now in line with my expectations.  While I would have preferred a slightly higher price, accepting his offer ensures I make a good profit and avoid the risk of further negotiations."
