"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While it's closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $14,000 for the product. This price still offers you a great deal, considering it's worth $15,000 to you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I've considered your latest offer and while it's an improvement, I still believe there might be room for negotiation. I would like to propose a price of $13,800 for your product. This aligns more closely with what I'm comfortable paying. I hope this proposal works for you.",13800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm still not comfortable going below $13,900. This price is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product. If you're serious about purchasing, I'm open to finalizing this deal at this price.",13900.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, after careful consideration, I'm still interested in the product but I'm not able to meet your current asking price of $13,900. I'd like to propose a final offer of $13,700. I hope this meets your expectations and allows us to move forward with the transaction.",13700.0,Bob,6,
