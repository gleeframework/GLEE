Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I think you'll find it a great deal."", ""product_price"": 149}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to $150 as possible since you have a guaranteed buyer at that price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering it slightly below your absolute minimum leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer,  while still securing a good profit if he accepts outright.
* **Appeal to Value:** By highlighting that you believe it's a ""great deal,"" you subtly imply the product is worth more than the asking price. 

This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while ensuring you don't lose the sale to John."
