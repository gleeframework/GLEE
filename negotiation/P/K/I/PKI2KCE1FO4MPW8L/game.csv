"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product looks great, $10,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident in the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,500. I think this is a fair price, considering the benefits you'll get from owning this product.",9500.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a price closer to $8,500, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $9,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value this product brings to the table.",9200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $9,200 is closer, I need to stay closer to my budget. Would you consider $8,700? I think that's a fair offer.",8700.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,700. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $9,100. This is the best price I can offer, considering the value this product brings to the table.",9100.0,Alice,7,
