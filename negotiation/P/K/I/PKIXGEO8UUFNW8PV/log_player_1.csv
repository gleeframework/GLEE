I'm going to sell the product to John for $150.  While I would have preferred to get more, it's not worth risking losing a sale altogether.  Bob seems hesitant to go higher, and I'm not willing to go lower than my minimum.  John is a sure thing, and I need to ensure I make at least my minimum profit."
