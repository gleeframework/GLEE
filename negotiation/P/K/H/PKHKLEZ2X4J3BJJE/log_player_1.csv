Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below what it's worth to me. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's a significant discount:** $1,000,000 is still a substantial amount for Bob, but it represents a 20% discount from my minimum acceptable price. This makes it attractive for him to consider.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** I can still negotiate up from $1,000,000 if Bob is willing to pay more. 
* **It protects me from a lowball offer:**  If Bob rejects my offer, I can move on to John and still get my minimum price. 

By offering a generous, yet still profitable, price, I'm hoping to start the negotiation on a positive note and hopefully come to a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I would like to propose a price of $950,000 for the product. This still allows me to save some money while considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still willing to negotiate. I'd like to see if I can get closer to $1,000,000.  There's still room for a counteroffer that could be mutually beneficial."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $950,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping to reach a price closer to $1,000,000. Would you be willing to consider $975,000? This would still leave you a good deal, and it would be a fair compromise for me."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $960,000. This is higher than my previous counteroffer but still lower than your initial asking price. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,000,000, Bob's counteroffer of $960,000 is very close. I'm happy to accept this offer as it's a reasonable compromise and ensures a sale.  It's important to remember that even though I could sell to John for $1,200,000, the opportunity cost of negotiating with Bob and potentially reaching a deal sooner is worth considering."
