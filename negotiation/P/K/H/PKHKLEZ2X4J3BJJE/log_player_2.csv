"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below what it's worth to me. Let me know your thoughts.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $950,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping to reach a price closer to $1,000,000. Would you be willing to consider $975,000? This would still leave you a good deal, and it would be a fair compromise for me.
