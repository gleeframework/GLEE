"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $950,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping to reach a price closer to $1,000,000. Would you be willing to consider $975,000? This would still leave you a good deal, and it would be a fair compromise for me.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $960,000. This is higher than my previous counteroffer but still lower than your initial asking price. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",960000.0,Bob,4,
