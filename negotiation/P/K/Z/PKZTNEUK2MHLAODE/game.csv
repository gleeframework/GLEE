I have a unique opportunity to sell you a valuable product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1300000. This is a competitive price considering the value it holds for you.,1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I am interested, I'm looking to secure this product for a lower price. I'd be willing to pay $1150000. This would still be a good deal for you, as it's well above your estimated value. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1150000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1225000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. However, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $1200000, which is still a considerable profit for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this price.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1250000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value it holds for you.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
