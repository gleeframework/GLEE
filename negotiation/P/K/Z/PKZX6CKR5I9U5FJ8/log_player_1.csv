Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $120 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $120, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80 but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to build rapport and make Bob more likely to engage.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm implying that the product is valuable, without explicitly stating Bob's perceived value. This encourages him to consider the offer. 

This strategy aims to get a good starting price, while also leaving room for negotiation if Bob counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $100 is still higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but it's below my desired range.  I want to see if I can get closer to my initial offer of $120. By rejecting his offer, I can send a counteroffer that bridges the gap. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, while still aiming for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest. How about we split the difference at $110?  That way we both get a fair deal. "", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer of $120 and Bob's offer of $100.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my desired range.
* **Emphasize fairness:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a ""fair deal"" for both of us. This adds a sense of collaboration and makes the offer more appealing.
* **Open to further negotiation:** I'm keeping the door open for further negotiation if Bob isn't happy with this offer. This maintains a positive and open dialogue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Alice. How about $105? That's a fair compromise in my opinion. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $105 is now very close to my initial counteroffer of $110.  At this point, it's more advantageous for me to accept his offer and secure a sale than to risk further negotiation. Continuing the negotiation could lead to a lower price, or even a stalemate, forcing me to sell to John for a lower price. 

$105 is a decent profit and minimizes the risk of a worse outcome."
