Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This is a strong opening position that leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident that the product is worth more than $1,000,000 to me, and I'm hoping to maximize my profit. I'll be prepared to negotiate down if necessary, but I want to see if Bob is genuinely interested in the product and willing to pay a significant amount for it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to **reject Bob's offer**. While $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe the product is worth more, and I want to see if I can negotiate a higher price with Bob.  I'm willing to continue the negotiation process for now, but I'll keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $1,200,000.  This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, showing flexibility while still protecting my profit margin.  I'm hoping this price will be appealing to Bob, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
