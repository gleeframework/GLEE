"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $12,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $16,000? It's a fair price, and I believe you'll still get great value from the product.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product, but $14,000 just isn't enough for me to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is my absolute minimum.  It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you say?",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is your minimum, but I'm still not comfortable going that high. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and $15,000. How about $14,500?",14500.0,Bob,6,
