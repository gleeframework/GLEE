(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to get a lower price.  There's a chance you can get a better deal than buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significant discount is a good strategy to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. $1,000,000 is a substantial drop from her initial offer, but still within the range of what you're willing to pay. This counteroffer sets the stage for further negotiation and shows your seriousness in acquiring the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is closer to your maximum budget, it's still above your desired price point. There's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting this offer allows you to continue bargaining and potentially get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your target price, and it's now time to meet her halfway. This counteroffer is a compromise, showing that you're serious about buying the product while still trying to save money. It leaves room for further negotiation if needed, but also shows that you are ready to finalize the deal if she accepts."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is only $50,000 above your maximum budget, there's still a chance you can get a better deal. By rejecting this offer, you can continue to negotiate with Alice and try to get closer to your target price of $1,200,000. There's a possibility that Alice might lower her price even further in order to finalize the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1225000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a strategic move. It's a compromise between Alice's last offer of $1,250,000 and your maximum budget of $1,200,000. It shows that you are willing to meet her halfway, but also that you are firm on your budget. If Alice is truly motivated to sell, she may accept this offer to avoid the risk of you going to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,275,000 is getting closer to your maximum budget, but it's still not within your desired price range.  While you could continue negotiating, the risk of Alice not accepting your counteroffer is high. Buying from John for $1,200,000 guarantees you the product at your maximum budget and avoids further negotiation."
