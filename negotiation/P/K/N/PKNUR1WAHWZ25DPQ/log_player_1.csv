Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $95. I believe it's a fair price considering its value."", 
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to start negotiations slightly above your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a profitable outcome. 
* **Close to Bob's Value:** Offering it at $95 is just below Bob's perceived value of $100, making it more likely he'll accept or propose a counteroffer close to your desired range.
* **Alternative Option:**  You always have the option to sell to John for $80, so there's no pressure to accept an offer below that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $85 is closer to your minimum, it's still below what you aim to get. By rejecting, you signal that you're looking for a better offer and keep the negotiation open. You can try countering with a price closer to $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your perspective, Bob, but I'm looking for something a bit closer to $90. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile."", 
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer aims to find a compromise. It shows willingness to negotiate while still striving for a price closer to your target.
* **Highlighting Value:** Re-emphasizing the product's value reinforces your position and justifies the higher price point.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $90 leaves some wiggle room for Bob to potentially counter with a price between $85 and $90."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $87.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** $87.50 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price ($80) and provides a reasonable profit margin.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing to negotiate could risk Bob walking away or becoming frustrated. Accepting at this point secures a good deal.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Selling now avoids potential delays associated with further negotiation, allowing you to use the funds for other opportunities."
