"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $100. If that doesn't work for you, I'm happy to go with John's offer.",100.0,Bob,4,
