Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is slightly below my minimum acceptable price of $150, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. It's also a reasonable starting point as it's more than half of the value Bob assigns to the product. This should encourage him to consider my offer, but still leave space for a potential counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is more than the product's worth to him, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm not willing to sell for such a low price. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $100. If that doesn't work for you, I'm happy to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is still too low for me.  While I could continue to negotiate with him, it's likely that we'll just go back and forth for a while.  Since John is willing to pay my minimum price of $150, it's in my best interest to sell to him and avoid further negotiation."
