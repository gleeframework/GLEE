"Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which reflects its value to me while still allowing for a good profit for you.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but the product's value is significantly higher than your current offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price represents a fair compromise, considering its potential and the unique benefits it offers.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm prepared to offer $950,000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it reflects a reasonable compromise for both of us. Let's try to reach an agreement before we run out of time.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to move on the price.  However, I need to see a more substantial increase to make this work. I'm willing to drop to $1,150,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's more than fair given the value this product holds.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your need to get a good price, but $1,150,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is a significant increase from my last offer. Let's close this deal. If we don't agree now, I'll have to explore other options.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
