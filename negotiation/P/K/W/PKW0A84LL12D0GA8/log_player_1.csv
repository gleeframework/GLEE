Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but I am looking for a more reasonable price. Could we discuss something closer to $500000?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $500,000 is better than nothing, I know the product is worth more to me than that, and I'm confident I can negotiate a better price. I'll try to meet him in the middle with a counteroffer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $500,000 is significantly below what the product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $750,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $600,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling it for that price. I'm willing to keep negotiating and see if I can push for a higher price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I've considered your offer, and while I appreciate your negotiation, $600,000 is still below the value I see in this product. I'm willing to go down to $650,000.
