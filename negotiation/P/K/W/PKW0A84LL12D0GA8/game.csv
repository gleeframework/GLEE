"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but I am looking for a more reasonable price. Could we discuss something closer to $500000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $500000 is significantly below what the product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $750000. This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",750000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I've considered your offer, and while I appreciate your negotiation, $600000 is still below the value I see in this product. I'm willing to go down to $650000. This is a good compromise and  I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's try to reach an agreement in this round.",650000.0,Alice,5,
