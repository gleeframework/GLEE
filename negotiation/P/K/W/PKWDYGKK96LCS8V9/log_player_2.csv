# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. I think it's a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $175 is significantly more than Bob's maximum budget of $100.  It's worth negotiating with Alice to see if a lower price can be reached."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and it's still a good deal considering the product's value.  Let me know if you're interested.

While $125 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still more than he's willing to pay. Bob should reject Alice's offer and continue to negotiate."
