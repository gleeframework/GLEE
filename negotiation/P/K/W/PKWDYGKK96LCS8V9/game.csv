"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and it's still a good deal considering the product's value.  Let me know if you're interested.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $110. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's closer to my budget and still allows you to make a decent profit. Let's try to come to an agreement.",110.0,Bob,4,
