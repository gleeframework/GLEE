"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 11500} 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is serious about buying and how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm going to lower my price a bit, but I'm still holding firm on getting more than $10,500.  This shows Bob I'm willing to compromise but also that I'm not desperate to sell."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer is very close to my minimum.  We're at round 4, and I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob and then being forced to settle with John for $10,000.  It's time to accept the offer and move on."
