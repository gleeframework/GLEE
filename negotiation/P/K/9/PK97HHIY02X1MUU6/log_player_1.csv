{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but allows room for negotiation. It also demonstrates a willingness to be flexible while ensuring I still profit from the sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to be flexible, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $95?  It's a fair price that still allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $85. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $85 is getting dangerously close to my minimum value. While I could continue negotiating, the risk of getting stuck with a price that's too low is too high. It's time to cut my losses and move on to the guaranteed sale with John."
