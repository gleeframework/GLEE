"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product, which I know you've been interested in. It's a valuable asset that could greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000.  This is a fair price that allows you to significantly increase your profits while giving me a great return on my investment. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is less than your maximum budget, you have a better alternative. John is guaranteed to sell you the product for $1,000,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can potentially negotiate a lower price with her or proceed to buy from John and save $50,000."
