"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price reflects that value.  I'm confident you'll see this as a great opportunity. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who's willing to pay the full market price of $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Alice is clearly trying to inflate the price. You know you can get the product for $1,500,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept Alice's higher offer."
