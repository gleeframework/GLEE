{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product! I'm asking for $100 for it, but I'm open to negotiating. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is significantly higher than my minimum value of $80.  This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get a better price. I'm also using friendly language to encourage a positive response from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $100 is a little more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you be open to $80?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $80 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get a better price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $80 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $90?  That's still a good deal for you, and it works for me."", ""product_price"": 90}
