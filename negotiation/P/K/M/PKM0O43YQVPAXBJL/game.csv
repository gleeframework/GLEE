"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $180 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'd be interested if you could come down to $135.  Let me know what you think.",135.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I can do $160, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. It's a great product and I think it's worth more than $135. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $145?  Let's get this deal done.",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $145. I can do $155, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great product and I think it's worth more than that.",155.0,Alice,5,
