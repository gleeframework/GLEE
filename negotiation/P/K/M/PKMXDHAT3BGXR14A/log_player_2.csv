{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, there's no reason to accept it immediately. You want to see if you can get a better price. Rejecting the offer allows you to initiate a negotiation and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend.  Would you be willing to come down to $125?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This shows Alice you're serious about getting a good deal, and it leaves room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the feedback, Bob! I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $137.50. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $137.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your desired price point, it's still a bit higher than you're willing to pay. You're still in the early stages of negotiation and there's room for Alice to lower the price further. Rejecting this offer allows you to continue the negotiation and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice. $137.50 is still a bit high for me. How about $130? I'm really interested in this product, and I think we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer continues to chip away at the price while still being respectful of Alice's position. You're showing that you're willing to compromise, but you're still pushing for a price closer to your ideal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $130 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit more and offer it to you for $135. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $135, which is within your budget and getting closer to your desired price point.  While you could continue negotiating, it's likely you won't get a significantly better price. Accepting this offer allows you to secure the product while still saving money compared to the initial price or buying from John."
