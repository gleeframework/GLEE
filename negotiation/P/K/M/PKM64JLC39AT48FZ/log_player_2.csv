Alice's offer is still a bit high, but it's closer to my limit. It's worth rejecting and making another counteroffer to see if we can reach a better price."

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget, and I'm not sure if I can get her any lower. It's better to just buy from John for $1,500,000 and avoid further negotiation."
