"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price point.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8,750. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,900, which is a fair compromise.  This price is close to your offer and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's reach an agreement at this price and move forward.",8900.0,Alice,5,
