Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price close to my minimum of $120, but I'm also leaving room for negotiation. It's likely Bob will counteroffer, and I'll be ready to adjust my price based on his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $110 is closer to my minimum, I still want to try and get closer to my desired price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 112}
``` 

I'm going to try and split the difference with Bob. I'm confident that $112 is a fair price considering my minimum and his willingness to pay $110."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $108 is getting too close to my minimum value of $120, and it's not worth risking further negotiation. I'm going to take the guaranteed $120 from John."
