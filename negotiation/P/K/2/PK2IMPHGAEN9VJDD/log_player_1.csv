Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,190,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential benefits to you. What do you think?"",
 ""product_price"": 1190000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Knowing John provides a guaranteed $1,200,000, Alice needs to aim for a price higher than that with Bob. 
* **Negotiating Room:** Offering the product slightly below John's price leaves room for Bob to counter-offer while still keeping the potential profit significantly higher than Bob's perceived value.
* **Strategic Messaging:** The message focuses on the product's value and fairness, subtly implying a degree of flexibility without directly stating it."
