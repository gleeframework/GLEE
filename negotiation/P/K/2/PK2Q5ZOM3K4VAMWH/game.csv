"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds significant value. While I cannot disclose the exact details of the product just yet, I can assure you that it's worth at least $800000 to me. I'm confident that it could be even more valuable to you.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1000000. This is a price I'm confident is fair and reflects the true potential of the product. Consider it an investment in a promising opportunity. If you're interested, please let me know. If not, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $800000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
