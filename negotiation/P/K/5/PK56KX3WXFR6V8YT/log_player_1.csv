Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $130. I think you'll find it's a great deal."", ""product_price"": 130} 

Here's why I chose this approach:

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($150) than mine ($100). This leaves room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit.
* **Justification:** Offering a reason (""a great deal"") might make Bob more receptive, even if it's subjective.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  By starting at $130, I anticipate Bob might counter-offer, allowing me to potentially settle somewhere between $130 and his counter-offer.

I'll carefully consider Bob's response before making my next move, keeping in mind my safety net of selling to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit steep for me.  Could you do it for $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

While $110 is above my minimum, I think there's still room for negotiation. Bob's counteroffer suggests he's quite interested in the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $120?"", ""product_price"": 120}

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This common negotiation tactic can feel fair to both parties and signal a willingness to compromise.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** $120 still provides a significant profit margin over my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Maintaining Momentum:** By making a counteroffer, I keep the negotiation moving forward and signal my continued interest in selling to Bob."
