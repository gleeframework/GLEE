"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a high price, aiming to maximize my potential profit.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my minimum, giving me space to negotiate down if necessary. 
* **Testing the waters:** This first offer will gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Not meeting minimum:**  While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation potential:**  Bob has shown interest, and his offer suggests he's willing to pay more than John. This gives me room to negotiate further.
* **Maximizing profit:** I'm willing to take the risk of continuing negotiations in hopes of securing a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm reducing my offer from $2,000,000 to $1,800,000, showing willingness to compromise.
* **Remaining above minimum:**  This price is still significantly higher than John's offer and my minimum threshold, leaving some room for further negotiation.
* **Testing Bob's limits:** This counteroffer will give me a better understanding of how far Bob is willing to go to secure the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting minimum:**  Bob's offer finally meets my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **No further room for negotiation:**  While I'd like to earn more, there's no guarantee that Bob will increase his offer further. 
* **Time constraint:**  I've already gone through several rounds, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing Bob altogether.
* **Avoiding risk:**  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me a sale at my minimum, eliminating the uncertainty of further negotiation and the risk of losing out to John."
