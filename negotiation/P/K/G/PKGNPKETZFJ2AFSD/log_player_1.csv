Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale. I believe it's quite valuable, but I'm offering it to you for $119.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows me to potentially negotiate down a little if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Ensure a Profit:** Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, the price is still well above my minimum acceptable price ($80).
* **John as Backup:** Knowing I have a guaranteed sale to John at $120 gives me leverage. I don't need to desperation-sell to Bob."
