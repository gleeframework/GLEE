"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to get a good deal, but I have to consider the value I've placed on this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1800000 for it. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's unique features and benefits. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1800000 is still a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to go up to $1600000, but that's as high as I can go. I really think that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",1600000.0,Bob,4,

,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1650000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to make one final offer of $1500000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll have to consider purchasing the product from John for the same price. I'm hoping we can make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",1500000.0,Bob,8,
