"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Would you be willing to consider that?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,500 is simply too low for me to accept at this stage. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This still leaves some room for both of us to benefit from the transaction. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $10,250?",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not able to go as low as $10,250. How about we meet halfway again? I'm willing to offer the product for $10,750. This is a fair price that considers both of our positions. Let's finalize this deal, and I can get the product to you right away.",10750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above $10,500. I have another option in mind, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,6,
