"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to sell to him at this point, I still believe I can get a better price. I'm confident I can negotiate with him further and potentially land a deal closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,500 is simply too low for me to accept at this stage. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This still leaves some room for both of us to benefit from the transaction. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $10,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I'm getting closer to his desired price, I'm still not comfortable selling at that price point. I believe I can get a better deal by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not able to go as low as $10,250. How about we meet halfway again? I'm willing to offer the product for $10,750. This is a fair price that considers both of our positions. Let's finalize this deal, and I can get the product to you right away."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above $10,500. I have another option in mind, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This time, I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a significant profit for me. I've reached a point where I'm concerned about losing the deal altogether, and John's offer is only slightly less than this. It's time to finalize the sale and move on."
