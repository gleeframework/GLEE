Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking $100 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to Bob's value, but I want to leave room for negotiation.  By starting at $100, I still make a good profit, but also show I'm willing to be flexible.  This increases the likelihood of a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is close to my minimum price of $80, and it's still a good profit for me. Accepting his offer is the most efficient way to close the deal and secure a good outcome."
