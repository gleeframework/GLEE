You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","I will reject Alice's offer because the product is worth $1,500,000 to her, and I can buy it from John for $1,000,000 which is a better deal for me.
