"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is well above my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $900,000. This represents a substantial starting point for our negotiations.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I can offer it to you for $1,350,000. This represents a fair compromise.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,350,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, but that's my final offer. I'm confident this price reflects the product's value and allows us both to close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
