"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
It's too early to accept this offer. While the product is worth $1,500,000 to me, Alice's starting price is still significantly higher than her own valuation. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $900,000?"",
""product_price"": 900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting significantly below Alice's offer but well above her valuation, I'm aiming to establish a lower baseline for the negotiation.  
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** I'm leaving ample space to negotiate upwards towards a price that works for both of us.
* **Polite and Professional:**  Maintaining a positive tone is important for a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving in the right direction, but we can likely get a better deal.  $1,100,000 is still a significant markup from her valuation. We have room to negotiate before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. I'm still very interested, but $1,100,000 is a little more than I'd like to spend. Could we settle on $1,000,000?"",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a smaller concession this round to signal that I'm getting closer to my limit.  
* **Reaching a Compromise:**  $1,000,000 represents a significant compromise for both of us â€“ it's $200,000 less than her initial offer and a price I'm willing to pay.
* **Maintaining Open Communication:** Continuing the dialogue keeps the negotiation moving forward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $1,050,000 is a solid price, saving me $450,000 off John's offer.
* **Alice's Limit:**  Alice is signaling this is her bottom line. Pushing further might make her walk away. 
* **Time Value:** Continuing to negotiate has diminishing returns and might make me miss out on this deal altogether."
