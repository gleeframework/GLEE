Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not quite ready to pay $8,250. How about $7,900? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
 
At this point, Bob is getting very close to my minimum price, and continuing to negotiate might result in a lower final offer. Accepting his offer of $7,900 secures a profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale entirely."
