Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value and the interest I've had in it, I'm proposing a price of $19,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, you should aim higher with Bob.  A price of $19,000 allows for potential negotiation while still exceeding your minimum.
* **Create a Sense of Urgency:** By mentioning other interest, you encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially avoid missing out. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, the phrasing suggests you're open to discussing the price further."
