Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, but I still think I can do better than $75. I'm willing to go up to $85, but that's my final offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has drawn a line in the sand and is unlikely to go lower than $85. While closer to your target, it's still more expensive than buying from John at $80. It's time to cut your losses and secure the product at the best guaranteed price."
