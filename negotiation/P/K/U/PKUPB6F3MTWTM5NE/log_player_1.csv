"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm starting with a price of $90. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than the product's worth to Bob, but not so high as to be immediately rejected. I want to see if Bob is willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is better than nothing, I'm not willing to settle for less than $80 right now. I'll see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm counter-offering at $85. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum price. Hopefully, this will be enough to get the deal done."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $78 is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not happy with it. I'm going to see if I can push for a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 82}
