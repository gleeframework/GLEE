"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $110.  It's a great deal, and I know you'll get good use out of it. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $110 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $100 from John.  Since your goal is to save money and you're indifferent between buying from Alice or John, going with John gets you the best price."
