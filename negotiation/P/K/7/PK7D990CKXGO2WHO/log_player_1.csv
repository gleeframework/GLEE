"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 17000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good deal while leaving room for negotiation.  I know the product is worth $15,000 to me, so I'm leaving some wiggle room to potentially come down in price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum, but I'm not ready to sell to John yet. I'm going to counter and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at my minimum price point. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me there."
