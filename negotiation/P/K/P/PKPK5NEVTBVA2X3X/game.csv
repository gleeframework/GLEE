"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in your product, $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,000. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $13,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  Could you meet me halfway at $17,500?",17500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17,500 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $15,000, which is my absolute limit.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work.",15000.0,Bob,4,
