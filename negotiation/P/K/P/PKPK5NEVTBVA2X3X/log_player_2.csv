"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.  Therefore, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the logical first step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in your product, $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Opening:** Bob starts with a lower counteroffer to establish a strong negotiating position. 
* **Reasonable Justification:** Bob provides a reason for his counteroffer (budget constraints), which makes it sound more realistic. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  He leaves some room for negotiation while staying within his budget limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $13,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  Could you meet me halfway at $17,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Budget:** Alice's offer of $17,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** Bob can still potentially save money by rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate. 
* **Risk of Buying from John:** While John offers a guaranteed price of $15,000, Bob might still be able to secure a better deal with Alice by continuing negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17,500 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $15,000, which is my absolute limit.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Bob presents his final offer, clearly stating his budget constraint.
* **Appealing to Compromise:**  He encourages Alice to compromise and highlights the potential for a deal.
* **No Further Room:** Bob establishes that he's unwilling to go higher, increasing the pressure on Alice."
