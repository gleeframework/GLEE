"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a good deal, you can likely get a better price. You're willing to pay up to $150, and Alice values the product at $120.  There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to spend a little less. How about $125? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm still holding out for a better price. How about we meet in the middle at $135? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll still get a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $135 is closer to what you're willing to pay, you can still try to get a better price. You're still willing to pay more than Alice's bottom line, so there's potential for a win-win agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  Let's try $130. I think that's a fair compromise that gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 130}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to accepting, Bob! But I still need to make a little more profit. How about we go back to my original offer of $135? It's the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is firm on $135 and is unlikely to go lower.  You're willing to pay up to $150 and this offer is a good deal compared to John's price of $150. It's a good compromise to secure the product at a decent price."
