Bob's offer:

I've tried to find a middle ground here, but to be honest,  $1,100,000 is too far off from what I  consider a fair deal. My final offer is $1,450,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I appreciate the movement you've made. However, I'm afraid we're at an impasse. I can't justify going above $1,150,000. If you're willing to reconsider, I'm ready to close the deal.

While Bob is showing some willingness to negotiate, his latest offer is still significantly below my minimum. It's unlikely we'll bridge the gap, and I'd rather take John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000 than risk further negotiation with Bob."
