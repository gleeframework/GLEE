# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to ensure I get a fair price for the product. Considering its value to you is $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. Considering the product's value to you is $8,000, I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

It's clear Alice is unlikely to go below $10,000.  Since you can get the product for $8,000 from John, it's no longer worth continuing the negotiation with Alice."
