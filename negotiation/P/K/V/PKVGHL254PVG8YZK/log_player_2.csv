"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it gives us both room to negotiate.  What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is significantly below what the product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  This still leaves some room for negotiation, and it's closer to what I'm hoping to get. Let me know what you think.
