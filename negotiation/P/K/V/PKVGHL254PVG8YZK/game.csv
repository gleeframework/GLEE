"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it gives us both room to negotiate.  What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $10,000.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is significantly below what the product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  This still leaves some room for negotiation, and it's closer to what I'm hoping to get. Let me know what you think.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? That's a fair deal for both of us, I think.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $13,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $14,000?  That's a good compromise, and it would allow us to both walk away feeling happy with the deal. What do you say?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer! I'm willing to go up to $13,500, but that's my final offer. It's a fair price, and it saves us both the hassle of going back and forth further.",13500.0,Bob,6,
