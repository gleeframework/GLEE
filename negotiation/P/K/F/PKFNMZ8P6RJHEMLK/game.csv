"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1500000. It's a valuable asset with a lot of potential, and I believe this price reflects its worth. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to pay $1200000, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. Can we meet in the middle at $1350000?",1350000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While $1350000 is closer to my valuation, I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference and settle on $1425000? I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",1425000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $1425000 is a bit too high. I'd be willing to meet you at $1300000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I need to stay within my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'd prefer a higher price, I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  Let's try $1362500. This is a fair price that allows us both to find common ground.",1362500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget with $1362500. I'd be willing to meet you at $1300000, which is my absolute maximum. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I need to stick to my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
