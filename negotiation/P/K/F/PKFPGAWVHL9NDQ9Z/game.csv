"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $10,500?  This would still be a great deal for you and allow me to stay within my budget.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $11,500 for the product. How about we discuss a price of $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11,500 is still a bit outside my budget.  Let's split the difference:  $11,250. I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the transaction.",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,500 and $11,250, which would be $11,375. This is the lowest price I can consider, and I believe it's still a fair offer considering the value of the product.",11375.0,Alice,5,
