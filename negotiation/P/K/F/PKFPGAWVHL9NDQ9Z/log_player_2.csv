"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $10,500?  This would still be a great deal for you and allow me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $11,500 for the product. How about we discuss a price of $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price.  Bob should continue negotiating, hoping to bring the price down further. There's still potential for a better deal, and Bob has a few rounds left to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11,500 is still a bit outside my budget.  Let's split the difference:  $11,250. I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the transaction."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,500 and $11,250, which would be $11,375. This is the lowest price I can consider, and I believe it's still a fair offer considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,375
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,375 is the lowest she's willing to go, and it's a better deal than buying from John for $12,000. Bob has only a few rounds left, and continued negotiation might not result in a significantly lower price.  It's time to accept the offer and secure the product."
