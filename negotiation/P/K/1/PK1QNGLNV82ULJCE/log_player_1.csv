``` 

While I could continue pushing for a higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $1,920,000 is a strong strategic move at this stage:

* **Significant Profit:**  We are well above our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, securing a substantial profit.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob is clearly committed and has steadily increased his offer. Holding out too long risks alienating him.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now provides immediate returns and avoids the uncertainty of continued negotiation."
