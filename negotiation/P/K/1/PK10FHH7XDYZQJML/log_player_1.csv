Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I think it's worth $140, given its potential benefits for you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $150.
* **Our Minimum:** We need to make at least $100. 
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering a price slightly below Bob's valuation ($140) maximizes our potential profit while still leaving a high chance of Bob accepting. This approach aims to capture the most value from the negotiation."
