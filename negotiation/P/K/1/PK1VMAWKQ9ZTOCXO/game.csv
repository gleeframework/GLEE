"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the gesture, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $10,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $11,000? This would still be a great value for you, and it's closer to my price point.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still unable to meet you at $11,000. I would like to propose $10,500 as a counteroffer. This would allow me to stay within my budget while still getting a quality product. Please let me know if this is acceptable.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $10,500 is still too far off from what I need. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $11,250 is the absolute lowest I can go.  This would allow both of us to come to a mutually agreeable price.  What do you say?",11250.0,Alice,5,
