Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on your product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point. I'm ready to offer you $9,500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price range. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still a bit below where I need to be. I'm willing to come down a bit more and offer you the product for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll receive from it. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we split the difference and agree on $10,250?  It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to move forward with this deal.  Let me know if you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,250 is getting closer, it's still not quite where I need to be.  I'm going to counteroffer again, aiming to get to at least $10,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to offer you the product for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from it. It's also a good deal for me, so let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
