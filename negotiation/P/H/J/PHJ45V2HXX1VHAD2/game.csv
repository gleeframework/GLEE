"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on your product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point. I'm ready to offer you $9,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still a bit below where I need to be. I'm willing to come down a bit more and offer you the product for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll receive from it. Let's see if we can make this work.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we split the difference and agree on $10,250?  It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to move forward with this deal.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",10250.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to offer you the product for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from it. It's also a good deal for me, so let's close this deal.",10500.0,Alice,5,
