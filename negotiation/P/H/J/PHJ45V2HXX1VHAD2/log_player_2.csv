"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal. It's worth negotiating with Alice to see if a lower price is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on your product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point. I'm ready to offer you $9,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above Alice's minimum value of $8,000. This gives Alice room to negotiate without feeling like she's losing out. It's also a good starting point for Bob to see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still a bit below where I need to be. I'm willing to come down a bit more and offer you the product for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll receive from it. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, $11,000 is still a bit higher than Bob wants to pay.  He can likely get a better price if he continues to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we split the difference and agree on $10,250?  It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to move forward with this deal.  Let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to be persistent in negotiating a lower price.  He's offering a price that's closer to Alice's previous offer, demonstrating his willingness to compromise while still ensuring he gets a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to offer you the product for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from it. It's also a good deal for me, so let's close this deal.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
