"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget for this type of product. I'm willing to offer $800000 for it, which is a fair price considering my own valuation.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget constraints. While $800000 is significantly lower than my initial asking price, I'm willing to compromise. I'm prepared to drop the price to $1200000, which reflects both the value of the product and the need to find common ground. Let's see if this offer is more agreeable.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1200000 is still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable.  I'm going to stick with my original counteroffer of $800000.  This reflects the value I see in the product, and I'm confident it's a fair price.",800000.0,Bob,4,
