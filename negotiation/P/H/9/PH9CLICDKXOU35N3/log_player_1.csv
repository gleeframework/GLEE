Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. Let's try to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

While Bob is moving closer to my price, it's clear he's unlikely to reach a number I find acceptable. Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum desired price."
