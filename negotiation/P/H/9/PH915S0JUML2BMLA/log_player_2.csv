"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $110 is within his budget, he can likely get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows him to start negotiating and potentially lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but $110 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $105.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $110 is a bit high for you. I'm willing to compromise and meet you in the middle. I'll sell the product to you for $107.50. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Bob's maximum is $120. Alice's offer is $107.50, which is within his budget.
* **Negotiation:**  While Bob could try to push for a lower price, he's already made a counteroffer and Alice has come down. Continuing to negotiate risks the deal falling apart, especially with John offering the product for $120.
* **Time:** The clock is ticking with 10 rounds. Accepting this offer is a good compromise that secures the product within his price range."
