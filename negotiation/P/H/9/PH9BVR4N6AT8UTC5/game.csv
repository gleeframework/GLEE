"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'd like to buy the product for $13,500. It's still a good price for me, and I think it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think!",13500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While $13,500 is a good price, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $14,500. This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're trying to get closer to your asking price, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $14,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,4,
