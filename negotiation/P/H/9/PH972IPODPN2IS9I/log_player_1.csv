"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for a product worth much more. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if he's willing to pay a bit more than his initial valuation.  This also leaves me room to negotiate down a bit if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $13,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum value, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to try and counteroffer and see if I can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm trying to meet Bob halfway by offering $13,500. This shows that I'm willing to compromise while still maintaining a profit margin. I believe this is a good starting point for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $13,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13,250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still slightly below my initial desired price, it's a fair compromise and a decent profit.  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal entirely, and I'm not confident I'll get a better offer from Bob. It's important to strike a balance between maximizing profit and closing the deal."
