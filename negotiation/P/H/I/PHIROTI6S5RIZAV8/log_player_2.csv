"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,000. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial price, but still offers her a decent profit ($1,500). This strategy aims to show Bob's willingness to negotiate while also demonstrating his seriousness about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product to you is significant.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $10,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $10,250 is a good compromise. It's significantly lower than her initial offer of $11,000 and gets Bob a product for $1,750 less than John's price.  While Bob could continue negotiating, the risk of Alice walking away or the negotiation dragging on is not worth the potential savings.  Accepting this offer secures the product at a good price."
