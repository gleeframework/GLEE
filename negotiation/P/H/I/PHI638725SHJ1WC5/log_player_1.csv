"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting high with $10,000. This sets the initial bar and allows me to potentially negotiate down while still getting a good price. I am hoping to get the best price possible but am prepared to accept John's offer of $8,000 if Bob keeps counter-offering too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $8,500 is better than John's offer, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point.  I want to see if Bob is willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm counter-offering with $9,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this shows a willingness to negotiate while still keeping the price higher than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $9,000.  This is a good price, and while I'd ideally get more, it's significantly higher than John's offer and we're only in round 4.  There's a risk of losing the deal if I keep rejecting and counter-offering."
