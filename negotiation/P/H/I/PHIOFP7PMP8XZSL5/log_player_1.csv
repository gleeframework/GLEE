"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}

I'm starting with a high price, knowing that Bob's valuation is unknown. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially secure a better price than John's offer."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price and what John is offering. I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round."

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and it's closer to his initial offer than mine. I'll reject and try to push him closer to my value."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'm aiming for. There are still a few rounds left, so I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating to potentially secure a better deal."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but this time it's just slightly above John's offer. This is a strong signal that I'm serious about reaching an agreement, but I'm not willing to go much lower. With only a few rounds left, I need to find a compromise soon."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. While I'm not happy with the current offer, I'm hoping to reach a compromise in the final two rounds.  I will make one last counteroffer to see if we can reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm lowering my price one last time to try to reach an agreement with Bob. This offer is still above John's offer, but it's a significant compromise on my part.  I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in the product and accept this final offer."

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,425,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is the last round, and while Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'm hoping to get. I'm concerned that if I reject his offer, we might not reach an agreement, and I'll be left with no deal. 

It's better to secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John rather than risk losing everything."
