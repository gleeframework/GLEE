"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a relatively high price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. I don't know Bob's value for the product, so I'm aiming for a profit while leaving space for negotiation. If he rejects, I can adjust my offer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob.  It's too early to sell to John, as I haven't exhausted all my options with Bob. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm countering with $12,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. I'm hoping this will be a more appealing price point for Bob while still ensuring a decent profit for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is a good compromise and is closer to my ideal price than my minimum. It's time to accept and close the deal.  Selling to John would only net me $10,000, so this is the better option."
