Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other potential buyers. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, aiming slightly lower than that with Bob allows room to potentially earn even more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $950,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but leaves him room to negotiate. It also underscores the product's high worth.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning other buyers creates a sense of urgency, potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of the message implies willingness to discuss the price further, should Bob counter-offer."
