"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $80 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $100. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's lower than what I'd sell it for to someone else.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100.
