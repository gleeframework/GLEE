"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, my budget is limited, and I am looking for a price closer to $10000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate towards that amount?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to you, and it's a bit closer to my minimum price. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
