"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500 to make this work. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be a great value.  Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $12,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let's make this happen!",12000.0,Alice,5,
