Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,500,000.  Let me know your decision soon, as I have another interested party waiting."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you want to aim higher with Bob. Starting at $1,500,000 gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Value proposition:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob specifically aims to justify the higher price.
* **Sense of urgency:**  Mentioning ""another interested party"" creates a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's personality:** If you know Bob is particularly price-sensitive, you might slightly lower the initial offer. However, starting high is generally a good negotiation tactic.
* **Negotiation skills:** Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters your initial offer. Having a clear understanding of your lowest acceptable price will help you through the negotiation."
