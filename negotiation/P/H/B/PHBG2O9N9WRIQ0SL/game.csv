"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'm prepared to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering your value for it and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This price still allows me to make a good profit and is closer to your budget. Let's make a deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? It's a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit and me to stay within my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
