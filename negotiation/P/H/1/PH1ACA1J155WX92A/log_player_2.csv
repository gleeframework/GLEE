"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is valued at $100 by you. I am proposing to sell it to you for $95, which is a great deal considering its quality and value. This opportunity won't last long, so let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum price point of $100.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best option to save $5."
