Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next rounds."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm open to negotiating, $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
