"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its unique features and benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $13,500. I'm confident this represents a fair deal, but I'm open to discussing further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,500 is a decent deal, it's still above Bob's ideal price point. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price in subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're offering, $13,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. Given my budget and the product's worth to me, I'd like to propose a price of $11,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both of our interests. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $11,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $12,250? This reflects the product's significant value while acknowledging your budget considerations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,250 is getting closer to Bob's desired price point, it's still above his ideal price.  Bob is willing to continue negotiating to see if he can get the price even lower.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. While I appreciate the compromise, $12,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,500, which is a fair price that reflects both our needs. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11500}
