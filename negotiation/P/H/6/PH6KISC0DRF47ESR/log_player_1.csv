Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're offering, $13,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. Given my budget and the product's worth to me, I'd like to propose a price of $11,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both of our interests. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
