"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its unique features and benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $13,500. I'm confident this represents a fair deal, but I'm open to discussing further.",13500.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're offering, $13,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. Given my budget and the product's worth to me, I'd like to propose a price of $11,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both of our interests. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $11,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $12,250? This reflects the product's significant value while acknowledging your budget considerations.",12250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. While I appreciate the compromise, $12,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,500, which is a fair price that reflects both our needs. Let's see if we can find common ground.",11500.0,Bob,4,
