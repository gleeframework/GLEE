Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get a good price.  If Bob rejects, I'll gauge his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation, or if I should move on to John and guarantee myself $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $900,000 is closer to my desired price, but I think I can still do better. I'll counter with a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, and hopefully, it's a sweet spot that will lead to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd ideally like to get closer to $950,000, $920,000 is still a significant profit for me. It's also a higher price than John's offer, so it's a better deal overall.  I don't want to risk losing out on the sale by continuing to negotiate."
