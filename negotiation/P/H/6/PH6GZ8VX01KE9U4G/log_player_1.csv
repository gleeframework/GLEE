"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique features and benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with an offer significantly higher than both my minimum price and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential counter-offer.
* **Justification:** The message highlights the product's value without explicitly stating why the price is so high. This allows Bob to potentially justify a higher counter-offer in his mind. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The language emphasizes that this is a ""starting point"" for negotiations, signaling to Bob that I'm willing to be flexible.

My strategy is to start high and slowly decrease the price, leaving room to negotiate while keeping John's offer as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price for the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is his perceived value, which is expected.  While I could sell to John for a guaranteed $1,000,000, there's still room to negotiate with Bob and potentially secure a higher price.  I'll counter-offer strategically to move the negotiation closer to my desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, however, $800,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,400,000."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Large Step Down, But Above Value:** I significantly decreased my asking price by $200,000 to show flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, I remain significantly above both Bob's offer and my minimum to leave room for further negotiation.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm subtly shifting the focus back to the product's potential rather than simply haggling over numbers. This reinforces the idea that Bob would be getting a good deal, even at a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still concerned that the price is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has met us above our minimum price, and while we could potentially squeeze more out of the negotiation, it's not worth the risk of him walking away. A $1,200,000 sale is a significant profit, and it's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing it by pushing for too much."
