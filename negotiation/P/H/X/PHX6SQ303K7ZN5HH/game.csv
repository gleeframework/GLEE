"I'm really interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $6000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $7000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7000 is a little too low for me.  I understand you have a budget constraint, but I can't go that low.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $8500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's the lowest I can go.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $8500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $7500, which is the lowest I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",7500.0,Bob,4,
