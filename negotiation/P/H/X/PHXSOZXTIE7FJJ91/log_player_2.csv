**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $1,300,000, which is less than John's price of $1,500,000.
* **You still save money:**  Even at $1,300,000, you are buying the product for less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best strategy to save the most money."
