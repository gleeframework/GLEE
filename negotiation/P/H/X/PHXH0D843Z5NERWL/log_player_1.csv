Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for sale. I'm asking for $200 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get a good deal."
