"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our exclusive product. Given its high value to you, we believe it's important to offer a fair deal. We propose to sell the product to you for $1,200,000. This price reflects a premium over the cost of production while ensuring a reasonable profit for us. We are confident this offer will be beneficial for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's opening offer is significantly higher than her product valuation ($1,000,000).  There's a lot of room for negotiation. You know you have John as a backup, so you can afford to counteroffer aggressively."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the product's value, but I'm working with a tighter budget.  I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:** Starting with a lower counteroffer ($900,000) leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly below Alice's asking price. This strategy aims to understand Alice's flexibility and potentially secure a much better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. After considering your offer, I believe we can find a mutually beneficial solution. I would like to counter your offer with a proposal of $1,050,000 for the product. This price still ensures a good return for us while reflecting the product's value to you. Please let me know if this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down, but she's still significantly above her valuation. We're making progress. Let's continue negotiating to see if we can push the price closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something around $950,000.  Would that price point be feasible?"",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Meeting in the middle:** This counteroffer splits the difference between Alice's previous offer ($1,050,000) and our last counteroffer ($900,000).  This shows a willingness to compromise but keeps us firmly in the desirable price range.
* **Testing the waters:**  By staying slightly below the $1,000,000 mark, we're testing to see how much Alice is truly willing to budge below her product's value to make a deal. 
* **Maintaining a fallback:** We still have the option to go with John at $1,500,000, so we're not desperate to close the deal at any cost."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In light of your latest offer, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,025,000 for the product. This price aims to bridge the gap between our previous offers while still providing a reasonable profit for us. I hope this proposal meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Favorable Price:** Alice has come down considerably and is now only slightly above her product's value ($1,000,000). Securing the product at $1,025,000 is a good deal. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Further negotiation might only yield small incremental savings. The time and effort required might not be worth the potential difference in price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a risk Alice might be less flexible in subsequent rounds, and we could end up with a less favorable outcome. It's better to secure a good price now."
