"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is better than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, $115 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for it.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to start with a counteroffer that is closer to his desired price point, but still allows room for further negotiation. This counteroffer also acknowledges Alice's offer and shows a willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 isn't quite enough for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $110.  This is a great deal for you and it lets me make a decent profit. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to get the product for under $110. He's already saved $5 from the initial offer, but he wants to see if he can get it down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer, but $110 is still a bit high for me. How about $108? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 108}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally lowering his offer, showing Alice he's serious about getting a deal but not willing to go too far below his target. $108 is a reasonable compromise, and it's still within his $120 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $108 isn't quite working for me. I'm willing to go down to $109. This is a fair compromise, and we can close this deal quickly. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $109, which is only $1 more than Bob's last counteroffer. At this point, it's likely that further negotiation will be difficult. Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product for a good price within his budget and avoids risking further rounds that might lead to a stalemate or a worse outcome."
