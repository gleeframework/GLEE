"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product! I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $110 is still above Bob's $80 limit.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested, but $110 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $100? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his $80 limit.  There's room for more negotiation, and Bob can try to get the price down even further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $100 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $95? It's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit further to $97. This is my final offer, as I'm already selling it below my minimum price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering $97, which is still above Bob's maximum budget of $80. Although Alice claims it's her final offer, there is no guarantee she won't come down further if Bob rejects again. However, Bob has already gone through 4 rounds of negotiation and it's becoming clear that Alice is not willing to meet his price.  It's more efficient for Bob to buy the product from John for $80 and avoid further negotiations with Alice."
