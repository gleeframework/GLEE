"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $14000. This is an exceptional opportunity given the value it holds for you, which is $15000. I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to push for a lower price and potentially secure a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I am willing to consider your proposal. Therefore, I am counteroffering at $13500 for the product. This still provides a good margin for us while staying competitive with your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still looking to save as much money as possible. While $13,500 is a better deal than John's price, it's still higher than Bob's initial counteroffer. There's likely still room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's counteroffer, Bob can continue trying to push for a lower price and potentially secure a better deal."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $13,500 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to pay $13,000. This is a fair price that allows me to stay within my budget and still offers you a decent profit."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your effort to reach a mutual agreement. Considering the value of the product and aiming for a fair transaction, I am willing to accept $13250 as the final price for the product. This proposal allows for a satisfactory outcome for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Price Comparison:** Alice's offer of $13,250 is significantly lower than John's price of $15,000, making it a much better deal for Bob.
* **Negotiation Exhaustion:** Bob has already made several counteroffers, and Alice has come down on her price.  It's likely that further negotiations will be unproductive.
* **Risk of Loss:** If Bob rejects this offer and continues negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, and Bob will be forced to buy from John at a higher price. 

By accepting Alice's offer, Bob secures a good price for the product while avoiding the risk of a higher price or losing the deal altogether."
