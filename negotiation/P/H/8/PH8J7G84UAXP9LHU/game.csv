"Hi Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000. It's a fair deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $975,000 yet. I'm willing to go down to $1,025,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll love the product.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I can see you're really serious about getting this deal done. I'm glad we're close, but I'm not quite ready to accept $1,000,000 yet. I'll meet you at $1,050,000, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to go that high, I'll have to consider other options.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
