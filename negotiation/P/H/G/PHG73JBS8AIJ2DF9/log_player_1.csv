"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Opening Offer:**  I'm starting high, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value ($1,000,000). 
* **Focus on Value:** I highlight the product's worth to Bob to justify the price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial offer is ambitious, it leaves space for negotiation in the subsequent rounds.
* **Prepared to Walk Away:** I have a backup option with John, which gives me confidence to hold firm if the negotiation doesn't work out in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $1,200,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering your own valuation. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $850,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation room:**  While Bob's offer is below my minimum, it indicates he is willing to negotiate. 
* **Time to counter:**  I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my target. 
* **John's offer as leverage:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $1,000,000 gives me confidence to hold firm in the negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is too low for me. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that still leaves room for both of us to benefit."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm lowering my price from the initial $1,200,000 to $1,100,000, showing willingness to negotiate. 
* **Justifying the price:** I reemphasize the product's value to Bob to support my counteroffer. 
* **Room for further negotiation:** I'm still above my minimum value, leaving space for potential adjustments in future rounds. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  I'm not accepting Bob's low offer, reminding him of my alternative with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,100,000 is still out of my price range. I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for the product, which reflects its value to me and leaves room for you to make a profit.  Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $900,000 is below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation still ongoing:** While Bob's offer is lower than I'd like, it shows he is still willing to negotiate and potentially go higher. 
* **John as a safety net:**  I can still sell to John for $1,000,000, giving me confidence to hold out for a better price from Bob.
* **Time for another counteroffer:** I'll reject Bob's offer and counter again in the next round, aiming to reach a price closer to my target."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $900,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product to you. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to accept $1,050,000. This is a fair price that considers both our needs."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob:** I'm lowering my price from $1,100,000 to $1,050,000, demonstrating a willingness to compromise and find a solution.
* **Emphasizing the value:** I reiterate the product's value to Bob, subtly reminding him of the potential he's missing out on if he rejects my offer.
* **""Middle ground"" appeal:**  The phrase ""meet in the middle"" suggests a fair deal that benefits both parties.
* **Staying above minimum:** My counteroffer is still above my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000, allowing for some wiggle room if needed.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  I'm not conceding to Bob's low offer, reminding him of my option to sell to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget, but $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle at $950,000? This would be a fair compromise that benefits both of us. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** $950,000 is still less than my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation is getting closer:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my target, but it's still not within my acceptable range. 
* **Time to counter again:** I'll reject Bob's offer and try to reach a compromise in the next round.
* **John as a safety net:** I can still sell to John for $1,000,000, which provides me with the confidence to hold out for a better price. 

I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I'm not going to sell below my minimum value."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your need to be within your budget, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $950,000 is still too low for me.  I'm proposing $1,025,000. This is a small compromise on my part, but it's the best I can do while still ensuring a fair deal for me. Let's finalize this."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** I'm lowering my price again from $1,050,000 to $1,025,000, showing flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement. 
* **Appealing to ""finality"":** I mention ""finalizing this"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Staying above minimum:** My counteroffer is still slightly above my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000, leaving some wiggle room if necessary. 
* **John as a backstop:**  I'm still prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob doesn't meet my offer, which gives me confidence in my stance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,025,000 is still a bit above my budget. Let's aim for the middle ground. I'm prepared to offer $987,500.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $987,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** $987,500 is still less than my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.
* **Limited negotiation rounds:** With only two rounds remaining, there's not enough time to negotiate further and risk getting a lower price.
* **John's offer is secure:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum value.  
* **Minimizing risk:**  Selling to John ensures I get my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob potentially leading to a lower outcome.

It's better to secure a known, reliable deal with John rather than risk further negotiation with Bob and potentially ending up with less than my minimum."
