Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize your potential earnings from Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While close to Bob's perceived value, the offer leaves a small margin for potential negotiation if he tries to haggle.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, justifying the high price.
* **Backup Plan:**  Remember, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $800,000 if Bob declines.  
 
This strategy balances ambition with a degree of realism to achieve the best possible outcome for you."
