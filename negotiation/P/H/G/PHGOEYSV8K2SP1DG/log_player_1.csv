"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 feels fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Aiming high initially leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's eagerness. 
* **Justification:**  Mentioning the ""potential"" of the product subtly hints at its value to Bob, justifying the high price.
* **Polite and Open:** Maintaining a positive and collaborative tone encourages negotiation rather than confrontation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is a significant sum, it's still a substantial distance from your initial asking price and even further from his perceived value of $1,200,000. There's room for negotiation. Selling to John for $800,000 would be settling for the bare minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the market value, but the product's unique features and potential warrant a higher price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?"",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession and Compromise:** Coming down by $75,000 shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate while still staying above the halfway point between your initial offer and his.
* **Reiterating Value:** By re-emphasizing the ""unique features"" and ""potential,"" you remind Bob of the product's worth beyond a standard market comparison.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** Suggesting you ""meet in the middle"" frames the counteroffer as a fair compromise and encourages Bob to reciprocate with a similarly reasonable move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider $975,000? I think that's a more reasonable price considering the market value and the product's potential. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, indicating he's willing to pay more than his initial bid. However, the increase is still relatively small. You're aiming for a price that reflects the product's true worth to him, and there's room for further negotiation before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While market value is a factor, this product offers unique advantages that justify a premium price. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This feels like a fair and final offer considering the value you're gaining."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** The tone shifts slightly to signal this is a strong offer, not just another step in a back-and-forth.  The phrase ""fair and final"" adds weight without being overly aggressive.
* **Value Focus:**  The counteroffer emphasizes the *benefits* to Bob, not just the product's features. This reminds him why he's interested in the first place.
* **Strategic Concession:** Dropping to $1,000,000 is a significant move. It shows you're serious about closing but not desperate. This price point is psychologically appealing and may be Bob's tipping point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective on the product's unique advantages, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, so I'll offer $987,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $987,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** While not ideal, $987,500 is a strong price, exceeding your minimum by a significant margin. It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a substantially better outcome.

* **Finality:** Bob stating his ""final offer"" increases the risk of pushing further.  He might be serious, and you'd lose the deal entirely.

* **Time Value:**  Dragging negotiations out has diminishing returns. Accepting now secures a very good price and allows you to move on."
