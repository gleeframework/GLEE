"Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. Given my budget and the value I see in this product, I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. This represents a significant saving for you while still allowing me to purchase the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is significantly below its true worth and what I'm willing to accept. To find a middle ground, I propose $1,700,000. This acknowledges your interest while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,700,000 is still a bit too high for me. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This reflects a fair compromise and allows both of us to walk away with a reasonable deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
