Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1900000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price to allow room for negotiation. This also establishes the product's value in Bob's mind.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $1,900,000, there's a significant gap between the offer and both your minimum and Bob's perceived value, allowing for a potential compromise.
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This initial offer will help you understand how eager Bob is to purchase the product and how flexible he might be on price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. Given my budget and the value I see in this product, I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. This represents a significant saving for you while still allowing me to purchase the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below both your minimum ($1,500,000) and your initial asking price. Rejecting this offer allows you to:

* **Demonstrate Value:**  Show Bob you're not willing to drastically undervalue the product. 
* **Negotiate Upwards:**  By rejecting his offer, you signal that you're looking for a price closer to your range, encouraging him to potentially increase his offer in the next round.
* **Maintain the Option of John:** You still have the safety net of selling to John at your desired price if negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is significantly below its true worth and what I'm willing to accept. To find a middle ground, I propose $1,700,000. This acknowledges your interest while ensuring a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1700000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Decrease, But Still Above Minimum:** This counteroffer lowers the price by $200,000 from your initial offer, showing flexibility. However, it remains significantly above Bob's offer and your $1,500,000 minimum, protecting your interests.
* **Moving Towards a Middle Ground:** This price aims to find a compromise between Bob's initial offer and your starting point. It encourages him to move closer to your range while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Maintaining a Sense of Urgency:** By keeping the price above John's offer, you subtly remind Bob that you have other options and encourage a quicker resolution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,700,000 is still a bit too high for me. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This reflects a fair compromise and allows both of us to walk away with a reasonable deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below your absolute minimum of $1,500,000.  Furthermore, his increments are getting smaller, suggesting he might not be willing to meet your price point. You have a guaranteed offer from John at your desired price, so it makes more financial sense to cut your losses with Bob and proceed with the guaranteed sale."
