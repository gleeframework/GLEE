Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at a price slightly below the midpoint between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's estimated value. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still leaving me with a healthy profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I've left room to negotiate downwards if Bob counters with a lower offer. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I've emphasized the value of the product to Bob to further motivate him to accept.

**Note:**  I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net. If negotiations with Bob don't work out, I can always accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still above my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is lower than my initial price, it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate further.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  I have the option to sell to John if negotiations with Bob break down. This ensures I'm not locked into a deal I'm not happy with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $1,100,000 is tempting, I need to stay closer to my asking price.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,125,000.  This would still be a fantastic deal for you, given the product's value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1125000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I've proposed a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing my willingness to compromise.
* **Maintain Profitability:**  $1,125,000 is still a good profit for me while remaining competitive with Bob's offer.
* **Reiterating Value:** I've again highlighted the product's value to Bob to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is now my minimum:**  While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's final offer is at my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:** There's a chance that rejecting this offer could lead to more back-and-forth with no guarantee of a better outcome.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  I still have the option to sell to John if this deal falls through, so I'm not taking a huge risk.

It's important to be pragmatic in negotiations.  Sometimes, accepting a good deal is better than risking a stalemate or a lower price."
