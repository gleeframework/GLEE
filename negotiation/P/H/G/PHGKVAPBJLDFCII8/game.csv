"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit though.  How about $10,500?  That's still a great value for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
