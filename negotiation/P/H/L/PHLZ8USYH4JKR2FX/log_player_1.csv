Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle around $1,200,000? I believe that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $1,450,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a lower price point.  Would you consider $1,300,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.
