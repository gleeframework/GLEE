"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle around $1,200,000? I believe that's a fair price.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,450,000? This price reflects the product's value and leaves room for both of us to walk away happy. What do you think?",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $1,450,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a lower price point.  Would you consider $1,300,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I want to make this work. However, I can't go any lower than $1,500,000. This price reflects the true value of the product. If you're serious about making this purchase, this is my final offer. Let me know what you think.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
