"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

There's no reason to accept Alice's offer right away.  Since you're willing to pay up to $12,000, there's always the option of buying from John. Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significant discount of $2000 from Alice's initial price is a good strategy. This shows Alice that you're serious about negotiating and are willing to pay a fair price, but also that you're not willing to accept her initial offer. This will hopefully encourage Alice to come down in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, which is good, but it's still above your target. Rejecting her offer allows you to continue negotiating for a better price. There's still room to bargain before reaching your maximum budget of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown she's willing to negotiate.  This counteroffer  moves closer to her latest offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still trying to save some money. This should encourage further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now within your budget and is only $200 more than your last counteroffer. Continuing to negotiate may not lead to a significantly better price and risks exhausting your rounds. Accepting this offer secures the product at a good price and leaves room for potential future negotiations."
