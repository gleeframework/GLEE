"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $1200000 is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering its exceptional value and rarity, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering $1600000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's true worth. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1600000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1400000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your latest counteroffer. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $1400000. Considering the product's exceptional value and rarity, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm counteroffering $1500000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's worth. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your latest counteroffer. I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but $1500000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer of $1300000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay, and I hope we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your latest counteroffer. I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $1300000. I've already compromised significantly, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1300000 and $1500000, which is $1400000. This is my final offer.
