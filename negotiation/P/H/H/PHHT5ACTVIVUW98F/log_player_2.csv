"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your business. Considering its value and the benefits it brings, I propose a price of $14,500 for the product. This is a special offer tailored to your needs and I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

You can likely get a better price than $14,500, so it's worth negotiating further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. After considering your offer, I am unable to accept $13,500 for the product. However, I am willing to negotiate further. Would you be interested in a price of $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $14,000, which is a good price considering your maximum budget is $15,000. It's better to secure the product at a good price than risk further negotiation and potentially having to buy from John at a higher price."
