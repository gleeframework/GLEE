"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you highlighting the product's features. However, $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for it, considering its value to me. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Given the value I place on the product and the interest you've shown, I am willing to negotiate closer to my original asking price. How about we agree on $120 for the product? I believe this strikes a fair balance between what I'm looking for and your budget.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $120 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and agree on $100? It's closer to my budget and a fair compromise, I think.",100.0,Bob,4,

"I see where you're coming from, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground. Considering the value of the product and your budget, how about we settle on $110 for the product? This is slightly above your proposed offer but below my initial asking price, aiming for a mutually beneficial solution.",110.0,Alice,5,
