"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, $12,000 is a decent price, but there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to get the product for as close to Alice's value ($10,000) as possible. By offering $10,500, Bob shows a willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for Alice to make a profit.  This counteroffer is aggressive but not unreasonable, potentially prompting Alice to reconsider."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $11,500, which is a good price for Bob, considering his value of $15,000. While Bob could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting the offer or the negotiation taking too long means it's better to accept this offer and secure the product at a good price.  There's also the risk that Bob could run out of rounds and be forced to buy from John at a higher price."
