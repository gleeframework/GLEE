"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I propose a price of $110 for it. This offer takes into account the worth you see in the product, aiming to make it an attractive deal for both of us. Please let me know if this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $110 is less than your maximum budget of $120, you can potentially get a better deal from John. Rejecting Alice's offer might lead her to propose a lower price, getting you closer to your goal of saving as much as possible."
