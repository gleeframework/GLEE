"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $650,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $950,000. This is a fair price, considering the value it will bring to your business.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $800,000 is your maximum budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $825,000, which is a compromise that still allows me to get a good price for the product. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is very unlikely to go below $825,000. At this point, taking the guaranteed deal with John for $800,000 makes the most sense to save the $25,000."
