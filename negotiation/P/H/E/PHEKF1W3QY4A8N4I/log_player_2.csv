"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since your maximum budget is $1,500,000 and Alice's offer is exactly that, there's no room for negotiation. You're not going to get a better price from Alice.  You might as well buy from John, as the outcome is the same."
