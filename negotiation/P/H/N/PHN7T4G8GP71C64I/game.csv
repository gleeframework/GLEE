"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic deal for both of us, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I really like the product, but I have a budget constraint and need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay closer to my initial offer. I'm offering you the product for $1,300,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down from $1,400,000 to $1,300,000, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,200,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there yet.  How about $1,250,000?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and  allows us both to achieve a good outcome.  Let's try to come to an agreement here.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,250,000, so I'm offering $1,225,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price that works for both of us.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,225,000 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but we need to be closer to my previous offer. Let's split the difference and go with $1,237,500. This feels like a fair compromise and allows us both to achieve a win-win scenario.  Let's make this happen!",1237500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,237,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,237,500, so I'm offering $1,218,750 for the product. I think this is a fair price that works for both of us.",1218750.0,Bob,8,
