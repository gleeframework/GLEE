"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $18000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $12000, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $18000. I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",14000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but $14000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $16000. This is a compromise that should work for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,3,
