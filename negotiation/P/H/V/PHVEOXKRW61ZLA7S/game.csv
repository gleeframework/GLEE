"Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,200,000 is simply too low.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?  This gives us both a good deal and allows me to stay within my desired range.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable going that low.  Let's split the difference at $1,325,000. It's a fair compromise, and it allows me to come closer to my desired price. What do you think?",1325000.0,Alice,5,
