"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $12500, which is a significant discount from the original price. I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but $12500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. Can you consider that price?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $11000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $11000 is the best price for this product, Alice. I'm willing to pay $9500, which is the maximum I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at this price?",9500.0,Bob,6,
