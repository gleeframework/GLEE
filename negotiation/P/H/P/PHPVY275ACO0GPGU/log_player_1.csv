Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I'm comfortable selling to John for $15,000, so anything above that is profit.
* **Bob's value:**  Bob values the product at $8,000, so I need to offer him a price that's above that to make it appealing.
* **Negotiation:**  $12,000 is a fair price that gives Bob a good deal (a $4,000 savings compared to John's offer) and allows me to make a profit. 

This strategy balances my desire for a good profit with the need to make the offer appealing enough to Bob."
