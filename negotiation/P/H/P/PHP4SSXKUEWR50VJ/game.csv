"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I'm thinking of a price of $15,000 for it.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15,000 is far beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for this product. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $8,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $13,500. I think this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $13,500 is still too high for me. Let's split the difference - I'm offering $10,500. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,500 is still a bit below my target, Bob. However, I'm willing to be flexible. I'm counteroffering at $14,000, which is a compromise that I think is fair considering the value I'm bringing to the table. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",14000.0,Alice,5,
