Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially setting the price at $1,100,000.  I believe this to be a fair offer considering its potential benefits to you. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Starting high allows Alice to potentially secure a price closer to her product's value to her ($1,200,000) while still offering it at a price Bob might consider (above his valuation but with room for negotiation).
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Alice has a safety net in John, ensuring she won't be forced to accept a low offer from Bob. 
* **Negotiation:** The message leaves room for Bob to negotiate, showing Alice is open to discussion and potentially reaching a mutually agreeable price."
