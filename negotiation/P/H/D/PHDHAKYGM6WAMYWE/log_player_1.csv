I'm offering the product to Bob for $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my guaranteed minimum value with John, giving me a good potential profit.  Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'm aiming high, hoping to get a better price than John's offer. If Bob rejects, I'll still be able to sell it to John and secure a decent profit."
