"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product that I believe you'll find valuable. I think a fair price would be $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $12,000, and Alice's offer is $11,000. This is a good deal, but you can potentially do better.
* Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price. 
* Buying from John is a fallback option if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm looking to save a bit more. I'm happy to pay $10,000 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $11,000 is my ideal price, I could meet you halfway at $10,500. This offer reflects the true value of the product.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer of $10,500 is a good compromise and falls within my budget of $12,000.
* While I could potentially continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might become less willing to bargain further, and I could end up paying more or having to buy from John at a higher price.
* Accepting the offer ensures I get the product at a reasonable price and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiations."
