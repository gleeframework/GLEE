"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's a great opportunity for you to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, that price seems a bit high to me. Would you consider a lower price?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $950,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also being more reasonable than my initial offer.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway.  How about we settle at $825,000? That's a fair compromise.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $825,000 is a tempting offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,5,
