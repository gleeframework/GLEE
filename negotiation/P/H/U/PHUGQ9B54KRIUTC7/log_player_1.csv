"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This leaves room for negotiation and hopefully gets us close to the middle ground of our perceived values.  I'm confident that Bob will see the value in this deal, as it's significantly less than what the product is worth to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, $90 is still a bit low. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round to try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
``` 

I'm offering $105, which is still above Bob's offer but closer to the middle ground. This should demonstrate my willingness to compromise while still ensuring I get a decent price for my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would ideally like to get more, Bob's offer of $85 is very close to my minimum price. I'm going to accept this offer before running the risk of further negotiation and possibly ending up with the lower price of $80 from John."
