"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. Would you be willing to consider this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I can accept. This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it can bring you a significant return. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my initial offer, so I'll propose $1,250,000. Can you consider this price?",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, taking anything less than $1,300,000 would be selling this product short of its true potential. I'm confident you'll see a significant return on this investment, even at that price.  Let's make this happen - do you agree?",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your confidence in the product's potential, Alice, but I'm still not willing to go above $1,250,000. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to my previous offer and propose $1,260,000. Can you consider this price?",1260000.0,Bob,6,
