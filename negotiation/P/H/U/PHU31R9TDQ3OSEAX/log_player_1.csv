Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're making a profit of $2,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob has a higher value for the product, so he might be willing to pay more.
* **It demonstrates your willingness to compromise:** By offering a price less than your ideal, you show that you're open to negotiation. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below your ideal selling price.  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting this offer gives you the chance to see if you can get closer to your target. You'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,500? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground:

* **It's closer to your ideal price:** You're trying to get closer to your desired profit margin.
* **It shows you're willing to compromise:** By moving closer to Bob's offer, you demonstrate flexibility.
* **It's still a good deal for Bob:** The price remains within Bob's value range, increasing the chance of acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is very close to John's offer of $8,000.  While there's a slight chance Bob might agree to a higher price in the next round, it's not worth the risk.  Selling to John guarantees you a minimum profit of $8,000, which is more than acceptable given the current negotiation."
