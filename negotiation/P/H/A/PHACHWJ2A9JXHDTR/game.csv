"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is reflective of its worth and potential ROI for you.  What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I was hoping to discuss a more competitive price. Based on my research, I believe the product's value is closer to $1,800,000. Would you be willing to consider a price adjustment to meet me in the middle?",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the product's value.  While $1,800,000 is a tempting offer, I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $2,100,000. This price reflects its unique features and the potential return on investment it offers.  What do you say?",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $2,100,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers, so I'm proposing a price of $1,950,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",1950000.0,Bob,4,
