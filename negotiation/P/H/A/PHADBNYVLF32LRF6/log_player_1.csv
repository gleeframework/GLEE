Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to your operations, potentially saving you significant costs in the long run. I'm confident we can agree on a price that benefits both of us. How does $1,300,000 sound?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While John guarantees $1,500,000, there's a chance to get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Starting high ($1,300,000) leaves room for negotiation. It's still significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but less than John's offer, giving Bob a potential ""deal"" feel.
* **Open Communication:** The message emphasizes mutual benefit and invites discussion, increasing the likelihood of reaching an agreement. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Skills:**  This strategy assumes Bob is open to negotiation. A very tough negotiator might walk away immediately.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  If a quick sale is critical, a lower, less negotiable offer might be wiser."
