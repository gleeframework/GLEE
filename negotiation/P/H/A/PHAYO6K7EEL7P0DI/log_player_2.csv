"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $1,150,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $1,050,000?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $1,100,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you'll get from this product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to Bob's maximum:** $1,100,000 is only $100,000 more than Bob's target of $1,000,000. 
* **Better than John's price:** This price is significantly better than John's offer of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation risk:**  Further negotiation could potentially result in a lower price, but there's a chance Alice might walk away or counter with a higher price, forcing Bob to buy from John at an even higher cost.

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice at this point, as it balances savings with minimizing risk."
