"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $120 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $105 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $115. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $115 is closer to his target, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. He might be able to get Alice down to $110 or even closer to his desired $100 by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $115 is closer, I'm still looking to get a bit closer to my target price.  I'm confident we can reach a deal at $110.  Let's see if we can make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your target price, Bob, and I'm willing to get closer to it. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $110. I'm thinking of a price of $112.50. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been trying to get the price down to $110. While Alice has come down to $112.50, this is still higher than Bob's desired price.  Considering that Bob can buy the product from John for $100, it makes sense to stop negotiating with Alice and purchase from John.  Bob saves $12.50 by choosing this option."
