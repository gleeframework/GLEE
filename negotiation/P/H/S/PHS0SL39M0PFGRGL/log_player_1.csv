Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm offering it to you first. Given its potential, I'm starting the price at $1,300,000."", ""product_price"": 1300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  I want to anchor the negotiation high, leaving room for potential concessions. 
* **Leave Room:** While I know Bob's maximum is $800,000, I'm leaving space to go down while still aiming for a price above my minimum ($1,000,000). 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This initial offer will help me understand how eager Bob is to purchase the product and how he values it. 
 
This is a starting point, and I'm prepared to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Valuation:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is above his perceived value of $800,000. This indicates room for negotiation.
* **Below My Minimum:**  While closer, $900,000 is still less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **John as Leverage:** I have a guaranteed offer from John, giving me leverage to push Bob closer to my desired price. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm serious about getting a higher price while keeping the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints. However, the value of this product is truly significant. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,100,000?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This approach aims for a perceived sense of fairness, potentially making Bob more receptive.
* **Strategic Concession:** By decreasing my price by $200,000, I demonstrate a willingness to negotiate while still remaining above my $1,000,000 minimum.
* **Maintaining Value:** My message emphasizes the product's worth, justifying the higher price point.

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while aiming for a price that satisfies both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching the Limit:** Bob's offer is inching up, but it's clear he's unlikely to reach my $1,000,000 minimum. Further negotiation might yield minimal gains.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** John offers a guaranteed sale at my desired price. There's no risk of further negotiation or Bob backing out.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing negotiations with Bob consumes time and energy. Selling to John provides immediate closure.

While I might have been able to extract a bit more from Bob, the certainty and efficiency of selling to John outweigh the potential for a marginally higher price."
