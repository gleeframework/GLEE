"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity and I believe it's a fair price given its value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** It's common to start with a higher price to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasis on value:** Highlighting the unique value of the product might make Bob more inclined to consider the offer. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message conveys that I'm open to discussion, making Bob feel like he has some leverage.

**Important Notes:**

* This is just a starting point.  The optimal price will depend on factors we don't know yet, like Bob's budget and how much he values the product. 
* I'll need to adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses in the subsequent rounds. 
* The threat of selling to John is a powerful tool, but I need to use it strategically to avoid alienating Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the unique nature of the product, but based on my research, I believe we can find a more agreeable price. How about $950000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is closer to my minimum:** While Bob's offer is still below my ideal, it's significantly closer to my minimum value of $800,000.  
* **Negotiation is still possible:** Rejecting this offer allows for further negotiation. There's still room for me to potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **Avoiding John's offer:** Selling to John now would mean leaving money on the table. I believe I can get a better price with Bob.

**Next Round:**

In the next round, I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle.  It's important to maintain a balance between pushing for a higher price and being flexible enough to reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. It's a fair price considering the unique value of this product. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows good faith and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Reiterating value:**  I'm still emphasizing the product's unique value to justify the price.
* **Seeking compromise:** I'm making it clear that I'm open to finding a solution that benefits both of us.

**Next Steps:**

* **Wait for Bob's response:**  I'll analyze Bob's counteroffer (if any) and adjust my strategy accordingly.
* **Consider John's offer:** If Bob continues to reject my offers, I'll need to carefully weigh the potential of getting a slightly better price from Bob against the certainty of John's $800,000 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. I would like to counter with $960000. This seems like a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing in on the deal:** Bob's offer is very close to my desired price. Accepting it will ensure a good profit and a quick close.
* **Limited room for negotiation:** Further negotiation might be possible, but it's risky. I've already made concessions and it's possible Bob won't budge further.
* **Minimizing risk:**  While I could potentially get a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer minimizes the risk of the deal falling through or having to settle for John's lower offer.

**Next Steps:**

* **Finalizing the agreement:**  I'll proceed with finalizing the sale with Bob. I'll confirm the details of the agreement and ensure a smooth transaction.
* **Monitoring John's offer:**  While I'm happy with the deal with Bob, I'll keep John's offer in mind. If the deal with Bob falls through for any reason, I have a backup option."
