Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. I believe this is reflective of its worth and potential. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have leverage. Starting with a higher price than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) allows room for negotiation.
* **Gauge Interest:**  The message is framed to gauge Bob's interest level and potential for negotiation. His response will give you insight into how much he might be willing to pay. 
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning ""listing it publicly,"" you subtly remind Bob that he might lose the opportunity if he doesn't engage.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if his initial response suggests he's not willing to pay $20,000. You can always adjust your price closer to $15,000 if needed, but never go below that threshold."
