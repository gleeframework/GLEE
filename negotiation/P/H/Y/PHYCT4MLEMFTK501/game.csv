"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a little high for me right now. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $825,000. This is a more competitive price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $825,000 is closer, but to be honest, I need to stay closer to my initial offer. Would you consider $750,000? I think that's a fair compromise that reflects the product's value and works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $800,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $790,000. This is a one-time offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",790000.0,Alice,5,
