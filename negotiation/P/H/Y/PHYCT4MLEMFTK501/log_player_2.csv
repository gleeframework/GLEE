"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $825,000. This is a more competitive price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $825,000 is closer, but to be honest, I need to stay closer to my initial offer. Would you consider $750,000? I think that's a fair compromise that reflects the product's value and works for both of us."",

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $800,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $790,000. This is a one-time offer, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $790,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $790,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a good deal for you. You're getting the product for $210,000 less than its worth to you and significantly less than John's offer. While you could try to negotiate further, Alice seems firm, and this price is already a strong win."
