"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. I'm interested in making a deal, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me, and it's a significant discount from your original offer.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to offer you the product for $850000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's still a significant discount from my original offer.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $850000 is still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to go up to $800000, which is the midpoint between your original offer and my initial counteroffer. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",800000.0,Bob,4,
