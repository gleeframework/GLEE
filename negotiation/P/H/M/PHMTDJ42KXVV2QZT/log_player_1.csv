Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product ahead of other interested parties. Given its value and exclusivity, I'm proposing a price of $12,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation and potentially securing a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value ($8,000).
* **Anchoring Bias:**  A higher initial offer can influence Bob's perception of the product's value, making a counteroffer within a more favorable range for you.
* **Backup Option:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, so there's a safety net if Bob rejects the initial offer. 

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can gradually lower the price, but always aim to stay above your minimum acceptable price of $10,000."
