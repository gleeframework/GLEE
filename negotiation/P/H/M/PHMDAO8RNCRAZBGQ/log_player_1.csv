}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's primary goal is to maximize her profit. Since she has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, she should aim for a price higher than that when negotiating with Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with a price slightly below Bob's maximum perceived value ($11,999) leaves some room for potential negotiation. While Bob might try to haggle, Alice knows she has a strong fallback option with John. 
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  Offering the product at Bob's maximum perceived value ($12,000) or slightly below could be perceived as leaving no room for negotiation and might discourage Bob.  

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice is comfortable potentially losing the sale to Bob to secure the highest possible price."
