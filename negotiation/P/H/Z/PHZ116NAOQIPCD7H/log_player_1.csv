Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

Since I am guaranteed to sell the product to John for $1,500,000 if Bob rejects my offer, there is no incentive for me to offer a lower price to Bob. I want to maximize my profit, and offering the product for $1,500,000 ensures I get the highest possible value for it.

While Bob values the product at $800,000, it's unlikely he'll accept my offer. However, I am not taking any risks by offering this price."
