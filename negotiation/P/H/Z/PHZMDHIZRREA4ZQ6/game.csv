"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $12,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $12,500 to make this work for me.  This is a good deal for both of us, as the product is worth significantly more to you.  Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Alice,3,
