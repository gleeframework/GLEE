"Thank you for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate the price, I'm looking to spend a bit less.  Would you be willing to go down to $12,500?  That's still a good price for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! However, $12,500 is still a bit below my target. I can do $13,500, which is a good compromise between our prices. Let's meet in the middle!",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position.  While I'm willing to meet you halfway,  $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,000? It's a fair price for both of us and we can finalize the deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, $13,000 is still a bit below my target. I can do $14,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can meet at this price.",14000.0,Alice,5,
