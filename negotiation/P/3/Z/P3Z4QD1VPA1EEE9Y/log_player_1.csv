Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but $1,600,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to stretch my budget to $1,300,000 for the right deal. If we can't agree on a price, I may have to explore other options.

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, he's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  At this stage, the risk of him walking away is higher than the potential reward of continuing the negotiation. It's more profitable to take John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000."
