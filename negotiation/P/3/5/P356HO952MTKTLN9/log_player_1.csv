This offer starts high, but it's still below what the product is worth to me ($1,200,000). It leaves room for negotiation while still maximizing my potential profit.  It also demonstrates confidence in the product's value."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1500000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. This is my best offer, and it reflects the value I see in it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While it's tempting to take $1,000,000, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price by counter-offering.  I'll try to bridge the gap and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Bob's offer:

While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired outcome. I believe I can push Bob a bit further. I'll counter-offer again, hoping to find a price we both agree on."
