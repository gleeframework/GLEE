"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1500000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. This is my best offer, and it reflects the value I see in it. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, $1000000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1300000, but I'm not able to go any lower than that.  This is still a fantastic deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1300000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1100000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. Let's see if we can finalize a deal at this point.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1100000 doesn't quite cover my costs.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1200000. This is a great price for you, considering the product's value, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. I'm confident this is a fair and mutually beneficial deal. Let's close this out.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
