Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's above his maximum budget, and he has a better option with John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, $1000000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1300000, but I'm not able to go any lower than that.  This is still a fantastic deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay.  He has a better option with John, who is selling the product for $1,200,000.  He can counteroffer Alice again, but at this point, it's likely more efficient to go with John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1100000 doesn't quite cover my costs.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1200000. This is a great price for you, considering the product's value, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. I'm confident this is a fair and mutually beneficial deal. Let's close this out. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

At this point, Bob should choose to buy from John. 

* **Alice's offer is $1,200,000:** This is the same price as John's offer.
* **There's no guarantee of a better price:**  Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, but there's no guarantee that she'll go lower.
* **Time and effort:** Further negotiation with Alice will take time and effort without a clear benefit.

Bob can save himself the potential hassle of further negotiation by simply buying from John."
