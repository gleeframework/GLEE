``` 

This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:**  Bob values the product at $10,000, so you're offering it for a price he might be willing to pay, especially if he sees the value in it.
* **It's below your minimum:** It's still above your minimum of $12,000, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** You can adjust the price based on Bob's response and your assessment of his willingness to negotiate."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to offer $10,000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum of $12,000.  I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
