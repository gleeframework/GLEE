Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible while still incentivizing Bob to buy.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so offering it below this is a guaranteed loss.
* **John as Leverage:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" subtly leverages John's guaranteed purchase, creating a sense of urgency. 
* **The Offer:** $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation but ensures a significant profit for Alice. Bob gets a $50,000 discount compared to John, making it an attractive deal for him."
