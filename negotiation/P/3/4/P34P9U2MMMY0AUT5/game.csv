"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $1,800,000. This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber. Let me know your thoughts.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,800,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $950,000?  That's a significant jump from my last offer and demonstrates I'm serious about buying.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we are getting closer. I recognize you're serious, so I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is my absolute bottom line, as it represents a significant compromise on my end.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
