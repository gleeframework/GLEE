Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $1,800,000. This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber. Let me know your thoughts.

Alice's offer:

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has come down to her minimum price of $1,500,000.  This is above your maximum price and more importantly, you know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John. It's time to cut negotiations with Alice and buy from John."
