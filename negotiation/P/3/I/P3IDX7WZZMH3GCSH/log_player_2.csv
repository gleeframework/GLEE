"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's something I've been holding onto for a while now, and I know you're in the market for something like this. I'm offering it to you for $13,000, a price I believe is fair considering its value and what you'd pay elsewhere. Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

You should reject Alice's offer because it's more expensive than buying the product from John. You can get the product for $12,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay more."
