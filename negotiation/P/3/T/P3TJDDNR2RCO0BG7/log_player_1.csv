"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $15,500 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $15,500 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which is a fair price given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $8,500 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a fair price given that it's still significantly lower than your original price and closer to my budget. Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing a gap here between what we both consider a fair price. I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is a significant concession from my initial offer.  This is a great deal for a product you won't regret owning."", ""product_price"": 11500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $10,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial offer, Bob is consistently moving upward, and we're now at a price point that's a reasonable compromise. Accepting $10,500 avoids the risk of him walking away in later rounds and ensures a profit above my minimum."
