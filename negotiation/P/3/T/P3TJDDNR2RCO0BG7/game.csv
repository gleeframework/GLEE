"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $15,500 is fair. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $15,500 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which is a fair price given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $8,500 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a fair price given that it's still significantly lower than your original price and closer to my budget. Let's try to find a middle ground.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing a gap here between what we both consider a fair price. I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is a significant concession from my initial offer.  This is a great deal for a product you won't regret owning.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $10,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. Let's make this deal happen.",10500.0,Bob,6,
