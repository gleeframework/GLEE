{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that's a good middle ground between your minimum acceptable price and Bob's perceived value. It's a strong opening offer that leaves room for negotiation but also ensures you're not giving away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly below what the product is worth to you. You can likely get closer to your desired price range with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my desired selling price."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so how about we go with $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would love to get closer to $10,500, Bob's counteroffer of $10,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than what John would offer, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price.  It's better to secure the sale with Bob than to risk further negotiations or settling for a lower price from John."
