"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  While it's within my budget, I can likely get a better deal by negotiating.  I'll reject the offer and see if I can push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,450,000 is still a bit steep for me. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This seems like a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. However, $1,300,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product for $1,350,000. This reflects the value of the product while still allowing for a reasonable profit margin for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,350,000. This is still a bit more than I'd ideally like to pay, but it's significantly closer to my counteroffer.  It's also lower than John's price.  I think this is a reasonable compromise and I'll accept the offer."
