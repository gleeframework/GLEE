"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but not so high as to be immediately rejected.  This gives me room to negotiate downward.
* **Building Value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's uniqueness and value, hoping to convince Bob that it's worth paying a premium.
* **Negotiation Room:**  I have room to lower the price if necessary, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John for $1,000,000 if Bob won't meet my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above My Minimum:**  While $900,000 is closer to my minimum of $1,000,000, it's still not enough.  
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** Bob is clearly interested and has shown a willingness to negotiate.  There's a chance I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation.
* **Minimizing Risk:** Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, but I want to maximize my potential profit.  Rejecting Bob's offer gives me more time to see if I can get closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I understand your perspective, $900,000 is still below my target price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects the product's unique value and would be a great investment for you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise by reducing my price from $1,200,000 to $1,100,000.
* **Maintaining Value:**  I'm still above my minimum ($1,000,000) and  highlighting the value of the product to emphasize its worth.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation flowing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1100000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While $950,000 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my target. 
* **Negotiation Momentum:**  Bob is clearly interested, and we're moving closer to an agreement.  Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation going and allows me to potentially push for a higher price.
* **Risk Assessment:**  While selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum of $1,000,000 and potentially even exceed it.  Rejecting Bob's offer gives me more time to explore that possibility."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This price reflects the value of the product and provides you with a significant opportunity. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1025000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my last offer ($1,100,000) and Bob's last offer ($950,000). This shows a willingness to compromise and indicates a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** This price is still slightly above my minimum of $1,000,000, giving me a buffer in case Bob is unwilling to go any higher.
* **Emphasis on Opportunity:**  I'm highlighting the value and opportunity the product presents to Bob, hoping to entice him into accepting my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1025000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $975000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  $975,000 is very close to my minimum price of $1,000,000. However, I still believe there's room for a slightly better offer.
* **Negotiation Momentum:**  Bob is showing a clear interest, and the offers are getting closer.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can push for a higher price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While selling to John guarantees $1,000,000, I'm hoping for a slightly better outcome.  A few more rounds of negotiation could potentially lead to a deal that's closer to my desired price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting very close! I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000 for this product. It's a fair price that reflects its value and ensures a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm confident you'll see the potential in this investment. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is my final offer, as it meets my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Emphasis on Agreement:** I'm highlighting the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement to encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Confidence in Value:** I'm reiterating my belief in the product's value to reinforce its worth to Bob. 
* **Urgency:**  While I'm willing to sell to John for this price, I'm making it clear to Bob that we're nearing the end of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1000000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Negotiation Room:**  Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price, and we've already gone through several rounds of negotiation. It's unlikely he'll significantly raise his offer.
* **Time is Running Out:** We're nearing the end of the negotiation process, with only 2 rounds remaining. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. This is a safe and secure option, and I'm not willing to risk further negotiation for a potentially lower offer. 

It's time to secure the deal and move on to other opportunities."
