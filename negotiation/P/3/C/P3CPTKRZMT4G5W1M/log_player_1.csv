"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1000000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $800000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $800,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  Rejecting allows me to counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000 for the product. This is a significant investment for you, and I believe the value of the product will more than justify this price.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $850000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it will allow us to finalize this deal.  Let's make it happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $850,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. While I would prefer to get closer to $900,000, I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely and ending up with just $800,000 from John. It's a good compromise, and I'm happy to accept it."
