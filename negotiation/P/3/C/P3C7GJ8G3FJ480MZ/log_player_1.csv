Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $9,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a profit. If he rejects, I can consider his counteroffer and potentially come down a bit, but I'll keep John's offer of $8,000 in mind as my floor price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum price of $8,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $8,500. This is a compromise,  meeting Bob halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer. It also keeps me above my minimum price, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Although Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum desired price of $8,000.  While I'm open to negotiating, I've reached a point where I'm confident I can get my desired price from John.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000."
