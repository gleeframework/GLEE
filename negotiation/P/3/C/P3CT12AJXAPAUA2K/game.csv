"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not willing to pay $15,000 for the product. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. I hope we can come to an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While $15,000 represents its full value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $13,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,800 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the price John is willing to sell it for. I hope we can come to an agreement.",12800.0,Bob,4,
