"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The product is worth $800,000 to Bob. Alice's initial offer of $900,000 is too high.  It's better to try and negotiate a lower price. There are 10 rounds, so there's time to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth $800,000 to Bob, offering $750,000 is a significant discount while still being within the acceptable range for Bob.  This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while also setting a clear expectation for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $850,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay.  There are still rounds left, and Bob can continue to try and negotiate a lower price.  He can potentially get the product for closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is willing to pay $800,000 for the product, and this is the final price he is willing to pay.  This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to meet Alice halfway while still staying within Bob's budget.  If Alice rejects this offer, Bob can always buy the product from John for the same price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $820,000 is only $20,000 higher than Bob's ideal price of $800,000.  There's a good chance that Alice won't budge further, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal and having to buy from John at the same price. Accepting the offer secures the product at a reasonable price with minimal further risk."
