"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000.  I'm open to hearing your thoughts on this.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $1,750,000 is still too high for my budget. I could go up to $1,100,000.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product.  Let's settle on $1,600,000.  This is a significant price reduction on my end, demonstrating my willingness to make a deal.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your flexibility.  However, there's still a substantial gap between our positions. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000, which is my absolute maximum.  This is a fair offer considering John is also willing to sell at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
