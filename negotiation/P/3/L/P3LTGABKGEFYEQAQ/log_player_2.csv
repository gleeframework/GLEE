"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  The product is only worth $100 to you, and Alice is asking for $90. This leaves very little room for profit.
* **Negotiation is possible:** You have 10 rounds, which is ample time to try to negotiate a better price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If negotiations fail, you have a backup option with John. 

By rejecting the first offer, you signal to Alice that you are serious about getting a lower price, and you open the door for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  Since the product is worth $80 to Alice, a price of $85 offers a reasonable starting point for negotiation. 
* **Balancing risk and reward:**  This offer gives Alice some room to profit, while also providing you with a significant discount from her initial offer.
* **Keeping John's offer in mind:**  While you're aiming for a lower price, you're still within a range that's better than John's offer, giving you some flexibility.

By offering $85, you're demonstrating your willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a strong position to potentially secure a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $86. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $86
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant progress:** Alice has moved from her initial offer of $90 to $86, which is a good discount. 
* **Close to your goal:**  The price is now only $6 more than what the product is worth to Alice, which is a fair margin for both parties.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate might lead to a slightly lower price, but there's also a risk that Alice could become stubborn or decide to stop negotiating altogether. 
* **John's offer is still a backup:** If you reject this offer, you can always go to John, but you'll be losing money.

By accepting the offer, you secure a good deal with minimal risk. The potential for saving an additional few dollars is not worth the risk of further negotiations."
