"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is within Bob's budget, it's still significantly higher than the product's worth to Alice. Bob should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating Bob's willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for further negotiation.  A price of $950,000 is a good starting point, as it is still above Alice's value for the product, but offers a considerable saving for Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's a bit lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's preferred price point.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if a more favorable price can be reached.  There are still many rounds left, and Bob has room to maneuver without jeopardizing the deal by going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is willing to increase his offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating his genuine interest in the product.  However, $1,000,000 is still a good deal for Bob, representing a substantial saving compared to John's offer.  This counteroffer positions Bob to potentially secure a good price while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer in this round is equal to John's offer. Bob has no incentive to continue negotiating with Alice, as there is no potential for a better price.  Buying from John will guarantee the purchase of the product within Bob's budget."
