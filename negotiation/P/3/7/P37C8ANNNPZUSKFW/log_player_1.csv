"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic [product description]! It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $200. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price.  I'm still early in the negotiation, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer from Bob, but I don't want to settle for the minimum.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $150 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $175.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $160? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price, especially since I have more rounds to negotiate. I'll counter with a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget. How about we split the difference and go with $165? That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 165}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but $165 is still a bit steep. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $155? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to close the deal, I'm still within the negotiation phase and I want to maximize my profit. I'll counter with a price closer to my previous offer, but I'll also be mindful of the remaining rounds and the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you. Let's try $160. It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 160}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $157.50. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $157.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $157.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is getting tight. I've only got a few rounds left and I'm worried Bob will walk away. While it's not my ideal price, $157.50 is still better than selling to John for $150, and it's close enough to my minimum that I'm willing to accept it to close the deal."
