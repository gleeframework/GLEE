"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's worth.  I could consider coming down to $1,350,000.  This offer reflects the true value of what's being offered.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While I recognize its value, $1,350,000 is still a bit beyond what I had in mind. Would you be open to considering $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle at $1,250,000?  This feels like a fair price that acknowledges the value you're gaining.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000. This seems like a fair deal for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
