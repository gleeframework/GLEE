"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $950,000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm still confident that this product can bring significant value to you. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we settle on $825,000? This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $800,000.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $825,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a lower price point. Would you consider $750,000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal if you're agreeable.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $850,000. This is the minimum I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so how about we settle on $800,000?",800000.0,Alice,5,
