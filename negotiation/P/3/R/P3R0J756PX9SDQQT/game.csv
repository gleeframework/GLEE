"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe will be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you at a price of $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value and quality of the product.  Let me know what you think!",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  Given the value to me, I'd be happy to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price.  How about $10,500? That's still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,500 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  Considering the value to me, I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  If that works for you, we have a deal.  Let me know your thoughts.",10000.0,Bob,4,
