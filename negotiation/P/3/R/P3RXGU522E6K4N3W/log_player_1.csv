Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum, but still leaves some room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $110 is a good outcome. It's significantly better than selling to John for $100, and the negotiation process is likely to continue with further counteroffers."
