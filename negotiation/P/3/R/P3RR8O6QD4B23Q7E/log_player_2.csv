Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a fair price considering the value to you.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand we're still a bit apart on price. I'm willing to come down slightly further to $1,275,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's close this deal now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,275,000 is very close to Bob's target price of $1,200,000.  Considering the limited rounds remaining and the potential for Alice to make a higher counteroffer in the next round, accepting this offer is the best option. This secures a good deal for Bob while saving him money compared to buying from John."
