"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,200,000.  This would still give you a good profit and leave some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a fair price considering the value to you.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This would be a fair compromise and would allow us to finalize this deal quickly.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand we're still a bit apart on price. I'm willing to come down slightly further to $1,275,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's close this deal now.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
