Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $1,500,000 is unfortunately higher than my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000 for it. This price is still within the range of its value to me, but allows room for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I could consider letting it go for $1,350,000.  This price reflects the true worth of the product while still offering you a competitive deal."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,200,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while remaining within my financial limits.  I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob is now offering my minimum acceptable price. There's no guarantee of getting a better offer from him in the next rounds.  It's best to accept and avoid the risk of losing the sale."
