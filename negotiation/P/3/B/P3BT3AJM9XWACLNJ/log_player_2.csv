"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth more than your assessment. I propose we start the negotiation at $14,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. He has a clear goal of paying no more than $12,000, and Alice's opening offer is significantly higher. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the negotiation process and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. Considering the value of the product and our previous discussions, I would like to counter with an offer of $13,500 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should continue to reject the offer. He's still above his target price of $12,000. While Alice has come down from her initial offer, it's still too high.  He can continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $13,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $12,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than his target.
