"Hey Alice, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay $90.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit.  $90 is a little low for me, but I'm open to $105.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $100? That would be a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
