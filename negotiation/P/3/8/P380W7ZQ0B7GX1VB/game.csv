"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1800000. This is a great deal, and I think you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate your confidence in its value. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1800000. Would it be possible for you to lower the price slightly? I am willing to consider offers closer to $1600000.",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as $1600000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1700000. This is a fair price considering its value and what I've seen in the market. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still feel that $1700000 is a bit steep for my current budget. I would like to propose an offer of $1650000. I believe this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1650000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $1680000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1680000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. I understand your position and I appreciate your efforts to reach a compromise. I would like to propose an offer of $1670000. I believe this is a fair compromise between our positions and I hope it will be acceptable to you.",1670000.0,Bob,6,
