Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $120. I believe it offers significant value at this price."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $150 to Bob. 
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $120 gives Bob a 20% discount ($30 off) while still earning you a $40 profit over your minimum. This balances maximizing profit while still making the offer attractive to Bob. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves room for Bob to negotiate down slightly, while still keeping you comfortably above your minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have John as a backup buyer at $80 provides a safety net. However, aiming higher with Bob first is strategically sound."
