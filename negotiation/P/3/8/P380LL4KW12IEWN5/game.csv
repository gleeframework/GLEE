"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $850,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value I see in this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,100,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,100,000. However, that's still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. It's a solid offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product while staying within my financial constraints. Let's see if we can finalize a deal at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I need to make a profit on this sale, so I'm going to offer you a price of $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for profit, but $1,050,000 is still out of my range. I'm happy to meet you in the middle once more and offer $1,000,000. This is a substantial amount for me, and it shows my commitment to acquiring this product. Let's seal the deal at this price.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm offering you a price of $1,025,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
