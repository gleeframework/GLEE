"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $90 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer but $65 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",85.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to negotiate, but $75 is still a little lower than what I'm aiming for. How about we settle at $82.50? This is a good compromise for both of us, and it'll allow me to cover my costs. What do you say?",82.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but I need to stay under $80.  Would you do it for $78?",78.0,Bob,6,
