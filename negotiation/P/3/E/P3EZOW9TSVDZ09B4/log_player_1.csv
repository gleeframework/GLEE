Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can find a price that works better for both of us. Considering the value of the product, I would like to propose a price of $950,000. I hope this suggestion is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still push for a better deal.  I want to see if Bob is willing to go higher."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is closer to our desired price, I'm still hoping to secure a slightly higher value for the product.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I understand your position, and I'd like to propose a price of $960,000. I believe this offers a good balance between the value of the product and what I am willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $960,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I still feel like I can push for a bit more, especially since I have the option of selling to John for $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can close the gap in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your offer. However, I'm still aiming for a price slightly closer to my initial target. I'm willing to drop to $970,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've reviewed your latest offer and I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with a price of $965,000. I hope this proposal will help us reach an agreement that is beneficial for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $965,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $965,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get a slightly better deal.  The difference between $965,000 and my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) is substantial enough for me to keep negotiating.  I want to see if Bob is willing to go higher before I consider selling to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close.  I understand your position, but I'm still hoping for a slightly higher offer.  I'm willing to come down to $970,000. It's a good compromise that considers both our needs. Let's see if we can reach a deal. "", ""product_price"": 970000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your continued willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a final offer of $962,500. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between the value of the product and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $962,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $962,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're running out of rounds, and Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but not quite there yet. The risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially reaching a deadlock is too high. I'm going to sell to John for $1,200,000.  While it's not the best-case scenario, it's a good deal that ensures I get a return on my investment."
