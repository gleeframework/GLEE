"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $850,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know if you're interested. If not, I'll be moving on to another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $850,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  He can get the product from John for $800,000, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best option."
