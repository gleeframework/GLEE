"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Buying from Alice saves you money:**  Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is less than the $1,200,000 you'd pay John. 
* **Your goal is to save money:** Even though you value the product at $1,200,000,  saving $100,000 is a good outcome."
