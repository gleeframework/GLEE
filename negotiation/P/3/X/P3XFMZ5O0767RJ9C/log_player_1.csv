{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value to see if I can get a better price.  It's important to leave some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low, it's below my minimum value. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $100 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $130. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm coming down a bit from my initial offer, but still staying above my minimum value. This shows flexibility but also demonstrates that I'm serious about getting a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down to $130, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum value, and I'm comfortable selling to him at this price. It's better than selling to John for the same price, as I'd rather have the product go to a buyer who seems genuinely interested."
