"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. It's worth more to you than that, and it's a great deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Value to Bob:** $120
* **Alice's Offer:** $100
* **John's Price:** $120

Since Alice's offer is lower than what Bob is willing to pay and lower than John's price, it's the best option for Bob.  He saves $20 compared to buying from John."
