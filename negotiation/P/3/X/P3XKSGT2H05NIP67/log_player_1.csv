Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I know it's a valuable item, and I think this price is fair considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $14,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product, encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message implies that I'm open to discussing the price further, setting the stage for potential counteroffers.
* **Alternative Buyer:** The threat of selling to John for $15,000 provides a safety net and motivates Bob to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget constraint and I'm trying to save as much money as I can. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $10,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss for me.
* **Opportunity for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is low, he expressed interest in the product and acknowledged a budget constraint. This suggests that there's room for negotiation. 
* **Leveraging John:**  I have a backup option of selling to John for $15,000, which gives me leverage in negotiations with Bob.

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price that's closer to my desired value while still being attractive to him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I can't go as low as $10,000, I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This would still give you a good deal considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 12500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  My counteroffer of $12,500 is a compromise, splitting the difference between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Maintaining Value:**  The price is still above my minimum acceptable value, ensuring I don't make a significant loss.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I reiterate the value of the product to persuade Bob it's a good deal.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message again suggests flexibility and willingness to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the counteroffer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $12,500, which would be $11,250. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $11,250 is still too low. It's close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it's not enough to make it worthwhile for me.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Negotiating further with Bob could lead to a lower price, potentially below my minimum acceptable value.
* **Secure Profit:**  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees a profit and avoids the risk and uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob.

**Conclusion:** It's more advantageous to sell the product to John and secure a guaranteed profit of $15,000."
