"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $900,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a significant profit while staying within my price range.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

After careful consideration, we're willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $875,000.
