"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product is significant to you, but I am only able to offer $750,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I still believe the product is worth less than $825,000 to me. I would like to counter with an offer of $775,000. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually agreeable price.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $775,000 is closer to my target, I'm still not quite there yet.  Let's meet in the middle at $800,000. This price is fair considering the product's value to you, and it allows me to cover my costs.  I'm confident this is a deal we can both be happy with.",800000.0,Alice,5,
