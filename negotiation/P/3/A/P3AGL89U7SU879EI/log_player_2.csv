"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my minimum asking price and allows you a significant profit margin. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice. $1,200,000 is still too high, and you can potentially get a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This price still allows you a significant profit, and it's a fair compromise considering my minimum asking price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

While $1,000,000 is getting closer to your budget, it's still higher than you're aiming for. It's worth trying to negotiate further and see if you can get Alice to come down closer to your $850,000 offer."
