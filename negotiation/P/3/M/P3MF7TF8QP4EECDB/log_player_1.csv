Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This gives me a good starting point and leaves room for potential negotiation. Since the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, he might be willing to pay a bit more to get it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum value of $15,000. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
``` 

I'm offering the product for $16,000. This is a compromise, as it's higher than Bob's offer but still below my initial price. I believe this could be a reasonable price for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm going to offer $14,500.  This is getting closer to my minimum and is only slightly above Bob's last offer, making it a reasonable compromise.  Hopefully, this will be enough to convince him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum, but it's still not ideal. I'm not convinced we'll be able to reach a higher price through further negotiation. Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me my minimum and saves me the time and effort of continued negotiation."
