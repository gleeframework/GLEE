"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our premium product to you. It's an exceptional opportunity tailored specifically for individuals like yourself who value quality and excellence. Given its intrinsic worth of $10,000 to you, I propose to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a special offer designed to ensure you receive the best value while allowing me to maximize my earnings. I believe this price reflects the product's true value and offers you a significant saving. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is using sales tactics to inflate the perceived value of the product. While she claims it's worth $10,000 to me, I've already established my maximum price is $10,000. Her offer of $9,500 is still above what I need to pay John. By rejecting her offer, I can see if she'll come down further or proceed with buying from John at my set price."
