Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it will be highly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $18,000, which reflects its true value and potential."", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes it more likely to secure a price closer to your ideal outcome. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $18,000, you ""anchor"" Bob's perception of the product's value at a higher point. Even if he negotiates down, it's likely to be closer to $18,000 than it would be if you started at $12,000.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $12,000 gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell to Bob at any cost.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. If he outright rejects the $18,000, you can gauge his reaction and gradually lower the price during the negotiation process. Remember, your absolute floor is $12,000."
