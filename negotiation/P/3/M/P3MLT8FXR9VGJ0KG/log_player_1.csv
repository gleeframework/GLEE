Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $120 to me, I'll start with a price that's slightly higher than that. Here's my offer:

{""product_price"": 130}

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but if not, I'm prepared to negotiate further!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's made a counteroffer of $125. Since $125 is lower than my minimum price of $130, I'll reject his offer and proceed to the next round. I'll make a new counteroffer that's higher than $125 but still reasonable.

Here's my counteroffer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer"": 128}

Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Bob's counteroffer was $125, and my counteroffer is $128. Since Bob's offer is still lower than my counteroffer, I'll make another counteroffer that's slightly higher than $128.

However, I'm getting close to my minimum price, and I don't want to overdo it. I'll make a small adjustment to my counteroffer to see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle.

Here's my new counteroffer:
