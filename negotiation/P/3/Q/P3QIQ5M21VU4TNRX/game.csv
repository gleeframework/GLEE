"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $85 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer but $85 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $95? This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I am still aiming to keep my expenses lower. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $90 for the product. I hope this is a reasonable compromise.",90.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go any lower than $92. This is a significant compromise from my initial asking price, and it's the final offer I'm willing to make. If you're interested, let me know. Otherwise, I'll have to move on to other potential buyers.",92.0,Alice,5,
