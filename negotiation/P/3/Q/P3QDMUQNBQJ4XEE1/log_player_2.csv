The product is worth $120 to Bob, and Alice is asking for $170. This is way above Bob's value. It's better to reject the offer and make a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $170 might be a bit steep, but I'm still looking for a price that's closer to the value I've put into the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $155. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155.

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above Bob's value of $120. It's worth trying to negotiate further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised quite a bit, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $150. That's the minimum I'm willing to accept for this product. If you're willing to meet me at that price, I'd be happy to finalize the deal.

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice is now offering the product for $150, which is still above Bob's value of $120.  It's a better decision for Bob to buy the product from John for $120."
