"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $170 might be a bit steep, but I'm still looking for a price that's closer to the value I've put into the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $155. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",155.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $155 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $140.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",140.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised quite a bit, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $150. That's the minimum I'm willing to accept for this product. If you're willing to meet me at that price, I'd be happy to finalize the deal.",150.0,Alice,5,
