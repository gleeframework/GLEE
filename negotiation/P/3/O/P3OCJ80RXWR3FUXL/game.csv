,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $200 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for your product.  Let me know if you're interested.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $175. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you won't find this product for a better price elsewhere. What do you say?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $175 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $125.  This is a fair price, and I'm sure we can reach an agreement.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $125 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $160. It's a fair price considering the value of this product.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we both compromise a little.",160.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $160 is still higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $140.  This would be a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",140.0,Bob,6,
