"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $200. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  While $120 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll try to negotiate with Bob further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $175?  That's a fair price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $150 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $150 is my minimum acceptable price.  There's no reason to risk further negotiation, especially since I can sell to John for the same amount."
