Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 950000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate while still securing a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While selling to John for $800,000 is tempting, I believe I can get a better price from Bob by continuing the negotiation. I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still maintaining a substantial profit. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that could lead to a successful deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is still far below my minimum acceptable price.  At this point, I'm confident that I won't be able to get a better offer from Bob. Selling to John for $800,000 ensures a guaranteed profit and avoids further negotiation."
