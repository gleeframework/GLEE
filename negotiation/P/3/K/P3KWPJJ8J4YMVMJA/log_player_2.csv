"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Since Bob's maximum budget is $1,200,000, and Alice's offer is exactly that amount, there's no room for negotiation to save money. Buying from John at the same price is the most logical choice as it avoids the risk of a lengthy negotiation that might lead to Alice rejecting Bob's counteroffers."
