``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your desired price range.** You're aiming to spend no more than $1,200,000, and her offer is $950,000. 
* **You have a backup option with John.** While John's price is higher, it's still within your budget and offers a potential point of leverage for negotiation with Alice.

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can potentially:

* **Negotiate with Alice:** You can use John's offer as a bargaining chip and try to get Alice to lower her price.
* **Explore other options:** You might be able to find other sellers with more competitive prices."
