"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit your work. To start the conversation, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  What are your initial thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the initial offer of $1,300,000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth. It represents a substantial investment on my end, and that price wouldn't accurately reflect its value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? I'm confident this price offers a fair deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $950,000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
