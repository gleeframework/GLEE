You have three options:

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for $8,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay more.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and potentially get a better price from Alice."

Alice's offer:

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than what he can get from John.  He should continue negotiating with Alice to see if he can get a price closer to his target."

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000.  Even though Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than what Bob can get from John.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice runs the risk of her getting frustrated and ending the negotiations entirely, leaving Bob with no deal.  It's better to take the guaranteed price from John."
