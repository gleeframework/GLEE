"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price.  You can always choose to buy from John if you can't reach a deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is your best starting point.  You're offering the absolute maximum you're willing to pay.  This puts the pressure on Alice to either accept or counter with a price closer to your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate, especially since you know her bottom line is likely lower than what she's currently offering.  There's still room for a deal that benefits both of you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show Alice I'm serious about buying the product. It's a good compromise between my initial offer and her current offer, and it shows I'm willing to pay more than my initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to your budget, but it's still above your maximum. Continuing to negotiate gives you a chance to potentially get a better price, even if it's just a small reduction.  It's worth seeing if you can get her down to $1,200,000 or even closer to $1,100,000.  If negotiations fail, you can always fall back on buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a significant increase from your previous offer, showing Alice that you are serious about making a deal.  It's also a good compromise, as you know Alice won't go lower than $1,200,000 based on her value for the product.  This is a calculated risk, as if Alice rejects this, you can always fall back on buying from John."
