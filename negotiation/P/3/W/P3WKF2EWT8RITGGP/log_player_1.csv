"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. If he rejects, I can lower the price in subsequent rounds, but I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value, and I believe there's still room to negotiate. I'll reject his offer and counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,750,000. This is still above my minimum value but shows flexibility. Hopefully, Bob sees this as a more reasonable price and we can come to an agreement quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value.  I'm going to reject it and counter with a higher price in the next round. While I'm starting to feel the pressure of time and John's offer, I believe I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,600,000. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, but it's still above John's offer, and I believe I can still get a better price than that. I'm hoping Bob will recognize that we're getting closer to a deal and will meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm hoping for. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a higher price in the next round.  I have a few rounds left, and I'm confident I can still get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm getting close to my minimum, but I'm still going to hold out for a bit more. I'm going to counter with $1,550,000. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, but I believe it's still fair, and I'm hoping Bob will see it as a sign of good faith."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm running out of time, and while Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum value. With only two rounds left, I'm concerned I won't be able to get a better deal. I'm going to accept John's offer to avoid risking ending up with a lower price."
