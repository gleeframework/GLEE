{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's better than Alice's initial value of $12,000, Bob can still do better. He has a guaranteed alternative with John for $10,000, so there's room to negotiate further with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to get the price as close to his maximum value of $10,000 as possible. Offering $10,500 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's last offer, but still leaves room for some compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should again reject Alice's offer. While $11,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, he can still get a better deal.  He knows he can buy the product from John for $10,000.  There's still room to negotiate with Alice and potentially reach a price closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer slightly to $10,750. This shows Alice he's serious about getting a deal but is still willing to compromise. It also keeps the negotiation moving towards his target price of $10,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While it's still above his ideal price of $10,000, it's only $900 more.  This is a good compromise considering that Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate and Bob doesn't want to risk losing out on a good deal."
