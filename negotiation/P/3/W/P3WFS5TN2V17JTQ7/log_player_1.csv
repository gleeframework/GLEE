Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and increases the chances of Bob accepting the offer. If he rejects, I can still make a counteroffer, and if the negotiation fails, I can always sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low, but it's a good sign that he's willing to negotiate. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but it's still above Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise but also that the product is worth more than his offer. I hope this encourages him to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, but he's getting closer to my desired price. I'll reject his offer and counteroffer one more time before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

This is my final counteroffer. It's a small compromise from my previous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will see it as a fair price. If he rejects, I'll sell to John."
