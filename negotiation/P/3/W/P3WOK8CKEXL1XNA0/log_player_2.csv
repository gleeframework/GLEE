"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,000,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is $1,200,000 to me. I'm willing to make some concessions to get us started. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the value you've placed on it. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to get the price down, but $700,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $850,000, and I can get the product for $800,000 from John. It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed deal."
