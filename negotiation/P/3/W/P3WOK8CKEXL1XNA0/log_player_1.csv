As we're just getting started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,000,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is $1,200,000 to me.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree your product is valuable, that price point is a little too high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

Bob's offer:
