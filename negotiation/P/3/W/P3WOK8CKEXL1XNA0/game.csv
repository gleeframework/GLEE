"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,000,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is $1,200,000 to me. I'm willing to make some concessions to get us started. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree your product is valuable, that price point is a little too high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the value you've placed on it. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $900,000 is still a bit beyond what I'm comfortable spending.  Would you consider $700,000?  I believe that's a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to get the price down, but $700,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
