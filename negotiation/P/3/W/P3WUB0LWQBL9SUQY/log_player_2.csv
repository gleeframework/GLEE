"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's valued at $1,200,000 to you, and I believe we can find a price that benefits us both. I'm starting at $1,100,000, reflecting the significant value it brings. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high. While it's a significant discount from your maximum, it's still a good amount above what the product is worth to Alice. It's worth seeing if you can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to the product's actual value. I'm willing to offer $950,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it beneficial. Let's work together to make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. It's a decent decrease from her initial offer, but it's still above what the product is worth to her. I'm confident I can get a better price if I continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
