Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of making an offer of $10,800 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $10,800 is better than John's offer, I'm still confident I can get a better price from Bob. I'm willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $11,200. This is a fair compromise, and I believe we can finalize a deal on this price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11200}
```"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $11,000 is a good deal considering Bob's counteroffers and John's offer.  It's important to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
