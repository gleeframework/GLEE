Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly valuable to you.  I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we know John will buy the product for $15,000, securing a deal with Bob above his perceived value ($8,000) will net a higher profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $12,000 creates a substantial perceived discount for Bob, potentially enticing him to buy. This price also allows for negotiation room if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Selling to Bob quickly avoids potential delays associated with finding another buyer, even if John is a guaranteed sale.

This offer balances the risk of Bob rejecting the offer with the potential reward of a higher profit margin."
