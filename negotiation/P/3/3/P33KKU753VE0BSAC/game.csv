"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $110 for it. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. How about we meet in the middle at $130? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm happy to pay $115 for it. Let's see if we can make this work.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to make a profit. How about we compromise at $125? I'm willing to meet you halfway between $115 and $130",125.0,Alice,5,
