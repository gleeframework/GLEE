"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $10,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  I'm serious about buying this product, and I think this is a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
