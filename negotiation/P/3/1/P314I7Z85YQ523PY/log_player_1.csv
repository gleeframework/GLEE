Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000.  This offer is time-sensitive as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer is significantly above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" encourages Bob to act quickly and potentially accept your initial offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting high, you give yourself room to negotiate down if Bob pushes back on the price.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale and maximizing your potential profit."
