"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $85.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your budget, $85 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $130?  That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $130 is still too high for me. I'm happy to pay $100 for the product, which is a fair compromise.  Let me know if that works for you.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $100 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $120, which is a good compromise and a fair price for the product.  Let's make this deal happen!",120.0,Alice,5,
