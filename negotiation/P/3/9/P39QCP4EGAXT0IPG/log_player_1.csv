Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth at least $12,000, but I'm willing to part with it for $11,000."", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly above Bob's perceived value ($8,000) gives you room to negotiate while still aiming for a significant profit.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By mentioning you'll list it publicly, you create a sense of urgency for Bob to make a decision. 

**Important Note:**  This is just one approach.  You could experiment with different prices and messages to see what yields the best results.  For example, you could start with an even higher price to leave more room for negotiation."
