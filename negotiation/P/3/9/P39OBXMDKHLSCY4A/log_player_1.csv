{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $9,500 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate down. 
* **Not too high:**  I'm not starting at my minimum of $10,000 because I want to entice Bob to negotiate.  
* **Positive tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and upbeat to encourage a positive interaction. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects the offer, I'll assess his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.
* If Bob's counteroffer is too low, I'll make a counter-counteroffer.
* If the negotiation stalls or I feel like I'm not going to get a good price, I'll move on to John, who is guaranteed to buy at my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $8,500 for the product. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While I'm open to negotiation, Bob's offer of $8,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob.  His initial rejection suggests he's interested in the product, and his counteroffer means he's willing to pay more than his initial stated value. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired $10,000 but still within a range that might be acceptable to him. 
* I'll carefully consider Bob's response and be prepared to make further adjustments or ultimately sell to John if necessary."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you're interested. While I understand your budget, I need to make sure I get a fair price.  How about $9,000?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to what I need. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm moving slightly closer to Bob's offer but still maintaining a price that's closer to my minimum.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm highlighting the benefits for Bob (""good deal"") to encourage him to accept.
* **Openness to further negotiation:** I'm signaling that I'm willing to negotiate further if needed.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've successfully negotiated a price that meets my minimum requirements.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to evaluate whether to make another counteroffer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the flexibility. However, considering my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $9,000. Would it be possible for you to lower the price further? I am willing to go up to $8,800. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer of $8,800 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Limited room for negotiation:** While I'm open to negotiation, I'm getting closer to my minimum, and I'm not confident that I can get a higher price from Bob.  

**Next Steps:**

* I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, but I'll be prepared to move on to John if the negotiation doesn't produce a satisfactory price. My counteroffer will need to be very close to my minimum."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To make this work, I need to be at $9,800. This is a significant reduction from my original asking price, and it's the absolute lowest I can go.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 9800}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** I'm making a final counteroffer very close to my minimum of $10,000. This shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal but also that there's little room for further negotiation. 
* **Highlighting concessions:** I'm emphasizing the fact that I've already reduced my price significantly, making it clear that this is my final offer.
* **Direct and concise:**  The message is direct and avoids any unnecessary fluff, focusing on the price and encouraging a quick decision. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a price that's just below my minimum, which is a decent outcome.
* If Bob rejects, I'll move on to John and sell him the product for $10,000, guaranteeing my minimum price."
