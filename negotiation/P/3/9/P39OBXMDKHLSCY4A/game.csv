"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you're interested. While I understand your budget, I need to make sure I get a fair price.  How about $9,000?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to what I need. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the flexibility. However, considering my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $9,000. Would it be possible for you to lower the price further? I am willing to go up to $8,800.",8800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To make this work, I need to be at $9,800. This is a significant reduction from my original asking price, and it's the absolute lowest I can go.  Let me know if this works for you.",9800.0,Alice,5,
