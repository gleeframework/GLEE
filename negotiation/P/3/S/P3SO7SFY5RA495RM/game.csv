"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm still a bit above my minimum value for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value it holds for you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $10,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value it holds for you.",10500.0,Alice,5,
