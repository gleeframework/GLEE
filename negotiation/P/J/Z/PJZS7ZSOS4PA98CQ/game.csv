"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Considering the unique nature of this product, I'm willing to pay $750000.  What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $750000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $850000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",850000.0,Alice,3,
