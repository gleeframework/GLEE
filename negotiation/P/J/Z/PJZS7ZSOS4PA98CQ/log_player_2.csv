"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll find very valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than my maximum budget ($1,200,000), so it's worth exploring if I can negotiate a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Considering the unique nature of this product, I'm willing to pay $750,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $750000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $850000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my preferred price, and $850,000 is still a significant saving compared to buying from John.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy at a higher price from John outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price."
