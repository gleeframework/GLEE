# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I'm suggesting a price of $125 for it. This is a special offer tailored to your needs, considering the significant worth you see in it. I trust you'll find this price fair and reasonable. Please let me know if you have any questions or need more information. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

While Alice's offer is lower than her product's value to her, it's still more than you're willing to spend. You know you can get the product for $100 from John, so rejecting this offer makes the most sense."
