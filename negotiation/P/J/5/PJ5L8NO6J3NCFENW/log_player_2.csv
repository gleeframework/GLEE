Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm confident the product's value justifies a higher price. To demonstrate my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,000,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's worth while still allowing you to make a substantial return on your investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
