"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Could we perhaps negotiate the price down to $95?",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your interest.  However, $95 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $105?  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up on your offer. While $100 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the value of the product for me. How about $107? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to get what we want. Let me know your thoughts.",107.0,Alice,5,
