"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this incredible product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product. I believe this is a fair price considering my own valuation and the potential for a quick and hassle-free transaction. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I believe is still a good value for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000 for this product. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair price considering the value we both place on this item. I hope we can find common ground and finalize this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your increased offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair value for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
