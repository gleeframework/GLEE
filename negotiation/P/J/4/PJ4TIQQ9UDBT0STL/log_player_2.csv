# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than her stated value, you know you can get the product for $1,200,000 from John. Rejecting this offer opens the door for a counter-offer from Alice (potentially closer to your target price) or allows you to proceed with buying from John at your desired price point."
