"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be a great addition to your operations. I'm open to discussing the price further, but I'm confident it's a fair offer.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less than $1000000. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it. I'm open to further negotiations, but I need to make sure we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm not quite ready to accept $800000.  I'm willing to come down to $900000. This price still reflects the value of the product, and it gives us both room to make a deal. Let's keep the negotiation going.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think the product is worth less than $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850000. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,
