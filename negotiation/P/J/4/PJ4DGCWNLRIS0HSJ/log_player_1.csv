Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be a great addition to your operations. I'm open to discussing the price further, but I'm confident it's a fair offer."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less than $1000000. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it. I'm open to further negotiations, but I need to make sure we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $800,000 is my minimum, I believe I can still get more from Bob. It's worth exploring a counteroffer and seeing if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm not quite ready to accept $800,000.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, and it gives us both room to make a deal. Let's keep the negotiation going."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think the product is worth less than $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850000. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $850,000 is a good compromise, and it's closer to my desired price than John's offer.  I'm willing to accept it to avoid further negotiation and secure the deal."
