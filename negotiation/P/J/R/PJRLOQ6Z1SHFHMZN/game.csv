"Alice, thanks for the opening offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $1,050,000.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  To be honest, $1,000,000 is about the highest I can go. If you're willing to work with that, I'm ready to close the deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I'm not willing to sell at $1,000,000, as I believe the product is worth more to me. My next counteroffer is $1,080,000. I'm willing to meet you at the middle, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product. However, $1,080,000 is pushing my budget. I can offer $1,020,000 as a final attempt to find a compromise. Let me know if this works for you.",1020000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $1,020,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My next counteroffer is $1,100,000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle from here.",1100000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close, but that's still a bit high for me. I'm willing to bump my offer to $1,040,000.  That's a significant investment for me, and I hope you can see it as a fair compromise.",1040000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell at $1,040,000. I've already made significant concessions, and I need to get closer to my target price. My next counteroffer is $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",1100000.0,Alice,9,
