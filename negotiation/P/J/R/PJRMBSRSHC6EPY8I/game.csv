"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. Can you consider my counteroffer?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit lower than I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000?  That's a significant discount for you, and it allows me to secure a fair price for the product.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $1,080,000 is still a bit lower than where I need to be.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the deal.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
