"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 200} 
 
I'm starting with a price of $200. This gives me a good starting point, and leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident that the product is worth more than $150 to Bob, but I want to see if I can get even more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low. It's not even close to my minimum value of $150. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to counter with $175.  This is still above my minimum value of $150, and I'm hoping that it will be more appealing to Bob than his offer.  I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I won't go any lower than $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still way too low. I won't settle for anything less than $150, so I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm going to counter with $160. I'm getting closer to my minimum price, but I still want to see if I can get a little more. It's important to stay firm but also be willing to compromise a bit.  I'm hoping this price will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not going to settle for anything less than my minimum of $150. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm going to counter with $155. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but I'm trying to meet Bob halfway.  I'm at my minimum acceptable price, and I'm hoping that Bob will finally see the value in my product.  If he rejects this offer, I will sell the product to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached my limit with Bob.  He's not willing to come close to my minimum price, and I've already made significant concessions.  It's time to move on and sell the product to John for $150. This is a much better deal than what Bob is offering."
