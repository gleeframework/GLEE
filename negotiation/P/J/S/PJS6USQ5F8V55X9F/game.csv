"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This still represents a significant value for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,200 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",10200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $10,200 is close, but I need to be at least $10,500 to make this work for me.  I'm willing to accept $10,500 as my final offer.  This is the best I can do, so let me know if you're interested.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $10,500 is your final offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. I'm not willing to go any higher, so I hope you can consider this offer.",9800.0,Bob,6,
