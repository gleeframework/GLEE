# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, the value this product represents is significantly higher than your initial offer reflects.  I could be persuaded to part with it for $1,300,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its true worth.  What do you say?
