"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it worth the value. Let me know what you think!",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Can you meet me at that price?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $110 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $125? That's still a fair price for the value of the product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $125 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $125, which would be $117.50. Can you consider that?",117.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $117.50 is closer, it's still a bit below my minimum. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $120 for the product, which is a fair price for both of us. It's the minimum I can go, and I think it's a good deal for you as well. What do you say?",120.0,Alice,5,
