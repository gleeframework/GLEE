"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a win-win, allowing you to benefit greatly while recognizing the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $1,200,000 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you create the opportunity to negotiate a lower price with her or proceed with purchasing from John. This strategy maximizes your potential savings."
