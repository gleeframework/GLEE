"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize the value of this product, $1,300,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. This represents a fair price considering the value we both place on it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your business, $1,100,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $1,250,000. This price reflects the significant value you've acknowledged and allows for a profitable deal for both of us. Let's bridge this gap and find common ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still slightly higher than I can comfortably pay.  I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial solution.  I'd like to offer $1,150,000.  This price reflects a fair balance between our respective values, and I believe it will allow for a smooth and successful transaction.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I truly appreciate your continued interest in the product and your efforts to find common ground.  $1,150,000 is still a bit below my minimum, but I'm willing to make one final concession. I'm offering the product for $1,200,000.  This price reflects the inherent value of the product and ensures a fair outcome for both of us.  I believe this is our best chance to reach a deal.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
