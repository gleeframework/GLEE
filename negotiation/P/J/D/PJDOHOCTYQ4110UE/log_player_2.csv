"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. It's worth a significant amount to both of us, and I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,300,000.  Let's discuss this further and see if we can come to terms. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible, and Alice's initial offer is already above his maximum budget.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize the value of this product, $1,300,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. This represents a fair price considering the value we both place on it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your business, $1,100,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $1,250,000. This price reflects the significant value you've acknowledged and allows for a profitable deal for both of us. Let's bridge this gap and find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still aiming to save as much as possible.  While Alice's offer is closer to his budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. He should reject and try to negotiate a lower price again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still slightly higher than I can comfortably pay.  I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial solution.  I'd like to offer $1,150,000.  This price reflects a fair balance between our respective values, and I believe it will allow for a smooth and successful transaction."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I truly appreciate your continued interest in the product and your efforts to find common ground.  $1,150,000 is still a bit below my minimum, but I'm willing to make one final concession. I'm offering the product for $1,200,000.  This price reflects the inherent value of the product and ensures a fair outcome for both of us.  I believe this is our best chance to reach a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is now at Bob's maximum budget:**  The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for that price.
* **Further negotiation might be fruitless:**  Alice has already shown a willingness to compromise, and it's unlikely she'll go lower.
* **Buying from John is not advantageous:**  Buying from John would cost the same, and there's no guarantee that Bob can negotiate a better deal with him in future rounds.

Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at Bob's maximum price, avoiding the risk of further negotiation and potentially losing the deal."
