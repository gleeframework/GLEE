"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $145 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $130, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm on a bit of a budget. How about we meet in the middle at $115? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to negotiate, but $115 is still a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $125?  That's a fair price for both of us and gets this deal done.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer!  I'm willing to go up to $118, but that's really my limit.  What do you say?",118.0,Bob,6,
