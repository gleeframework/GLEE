"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $2,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $1,800,000 for the product.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and it's clear you recognize the value of this product.  While $2,300,000 represents a premium price for its unique qualities, I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the potential return on investment you'll gain.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,700,000 for the product.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but the gap between our valuations is still significant. To be frank, $1,700,000 undervalues the product's true potential. I'm willing to make one more move and offer it for $1,950,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a very fair compromise.",1950000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $1,950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,750,000 for the product, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price.",1750000.0,Bob,6,
