Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $14,000. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you, but if you're not interested, that's no problem at all."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to $15,000 as possible since John is our guaranteed backup.
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting at $14,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's interested but wants a slightly lower price.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is friendly but also implies that we have other options if Bob declines. This subtly increases the perceived value of the product.

**Why this strategy is better than offering a lower price:**

* Offering it at or below Bob's perceived value ($8,000) leaves significant money on the table.
* Starting too low might make Bob suspicious of the product's quality or your motives."
