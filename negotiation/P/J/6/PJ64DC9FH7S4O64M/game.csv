"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18000.

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you offering the product, but $18000 is way above my budget. I'm happy to pay $12000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer the product to you for $16000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's still a good deal for you since you're getting it for $4000 less than its true value. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $12000.  It's a fair price considering the value to me and a good deal for you as well. Let's close this deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer the product to you for $14500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and it's still a good deal for you since you're getting it for $2500 less than its true value. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",14500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14500 is still outside my budget.  How about $13000? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",13000.0,Bob,6,
