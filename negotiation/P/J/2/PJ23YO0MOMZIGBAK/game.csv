"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $125 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $130?  That would be a fair deal for both of us.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $122.50 is just too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $127.50. I'm confident you'll be happy with the product at this price.",127.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $127.50 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to go up to $125, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at $125?",125.0,Bob,6,
