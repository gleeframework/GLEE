I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is a significant markup from my guaranteed minimum value of $800,000. 

Here's my reasoning:

* **High Value:** I believe the product is worth more than $800,000 to me, but I don't know its true value to Bob. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  A higher offer gives me the potential for a larger profit.  Even if Bob rejects, I'm still guaranteed to sell it to John for $800,000.
* **Negotiation:**  A high starting point allows for more negotiation room if Bob is interested. 

Let's see if Bob is willing to take a chance!"
