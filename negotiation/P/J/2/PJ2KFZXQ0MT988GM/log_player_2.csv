"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

You can do better than $100.  It's worth rejecting the offer and trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm offering $90. It's a fair price for both of us. I'm willing to pay more than what the product is worth to Alice, but less than what I would pay from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, $95 is a good price for me. It's still cheaper than buying from John and it's likely that Alice won't go lower."
