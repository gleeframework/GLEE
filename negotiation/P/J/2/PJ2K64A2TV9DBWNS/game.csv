"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value and what I can consider. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This offer reflects the product's unique capabilities and the long-term benefits it offers.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that price is still not feasible for me. To be frank, I'm considering other options closer to $1,000,000. If you're able to make a more significant adjustment, I'm still interested.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm keen to find an agreement that works for us both. To show my commitment to making this deal happen, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a significant move on my part, reflecting my desire to work with you.  I believe this price represents a fair and mutually beneficial opportunity.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate the effort, but the gap between our positions is still quite large. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000. This is a strong offer, and I need to see a similar level of flexibility from you to make this deal work.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
