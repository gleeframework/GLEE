{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair deal that reflects its worth. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,150,000 is a strong starting point. It's significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but leaves room for negotiation while staying above my minimum.
* **Open Communication:** The message aims to start a dialogue and gauge Bob's interest. It emphasizes the product's value without being overly aggressive. 

This offer gives me the best chance of maximizing profit while still making the sale highly likely."
