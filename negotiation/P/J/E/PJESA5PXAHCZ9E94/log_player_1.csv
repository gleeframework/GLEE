Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $14,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob to make the offer more appealing.
* **Open to negotiation:** My message indicates I'm open to discussing the price further.

This strategy aims to maximize my earnings while keeping the negotiation open and potentially reaching a deal that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I'm hoping to keep my budget under $12,000 if possible. Would you consider lowering the price to $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is better than Bob's initial offer of $12,000, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 

I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my value, but I'm not willing to settle for $13,000 just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I can't go as low as $13,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,500. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between our initial offers.
* **Value proposition:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement.

This strategy aims to find a middle ground that satisfies both of our needs, hopefully leading to a successful transaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see, Alice. Thank you for your flexibility. Given my budget, I'd like to propose $13,000 as the price for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has remained firm on his offer of $13,000, which is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I've already made a compromise, and further negotiations seem unlikely to yield a result closer to my target.

Given that John is willing to pay my full asking price of $15,000, it makes more financial sense to sell to him and avoid further negotiations with Bob. This ensures I get the best possible price for the product."
