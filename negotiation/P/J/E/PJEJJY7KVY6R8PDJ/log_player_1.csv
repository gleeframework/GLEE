Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings. I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value, but significantly lower than my own minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Fairness Appeal:** Emphasizing fairness and the product's value for Bob helps build goodwill and encourages a response.
* **Leaving Room:**  This price allows for several counteroffers before I need to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Potential for Better Deal:** While $900,000 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get a higher price.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and continue the negotiation, potentially securing a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $900,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This price is still within your stated value, and it allows me to achieve a more reasonable return on my investment. Let's meet halfway and seal the deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate by reducing my price from $1,200,000. 
* **Fairness Appeal:** Highlighting that $1,000,000 is still within Bob's perceived value for the product emphasizes the fairness of the offer.
* **Motivating Acceptance:**  The language ""meet halfway"" and ""seal the deal"" subtly pushes Bob towards acceptance.
* **Final Negotiation:** This counteroffer gives Bob one last opportunity to accept before I need to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $950,000. This is the highest I can stretch within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:** Bob's offer of $950,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a better price.
* **Time Factor:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing time and potentially missing out on the guaranteed $1,500,000 offer from John.
* **Risk Mitigation:**  Selling to John guarantees a substantial profit and removes the risk of further negotiation failures with Bob."
