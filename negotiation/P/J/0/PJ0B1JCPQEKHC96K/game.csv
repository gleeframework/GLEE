"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm very interested in the product, but my budget is around $800,000. Let's start there. I'm willing to negotiate a bit from there, but that's where I need to be.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $800,000 is significantly below the product's true value. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This would be a fair compromise and allow us both to reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
