Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not too high):**  While we know John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, aiming higher with Bob is worthwhile. A starting price of $1,300,000 leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding our minimum. 
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This initial offer helps understand how interested Bob truly is and gives us a baseline for negotiation. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message emphasizes flexibility and a willingness to discuss, making Bob more likely to engage in counter-offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm very interested in the product, but my budget is around $800,000. Let's start there. I'm willing to negotiate a bit from there, but that's where I need to be. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is Anchoring:**  Bob's initial offer is his maximum perceived value ($800,000). While he's willing to negotiate, he's setting a low anchor.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's a significant gap between his offer and both our asking price and our minimum acceptable price. Rejecting keeps the negotiation alive. 
* **John as Backup:**  We have the security of John's offer ($1,000,000), so we're not desperate to accept a low price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $800,000 is significantly below the product's true value. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction, but Above Minimum:** We've dropped $200,000, showing flexibility, but we remain well above both Bob's offer and our guaranteed sale price with John. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the ""true value,"" we're subtly reminding Bob that his perception of the product's worth might be undervaluing it.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counter-offer will gauge Bob's willingness to move substantially from his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This would be a fair compromise and allow us both to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Bob only increased his offer by $100,000, indicating reluctance to move substantially.
* **Below Minimum:** Even with further negotiation, it's unlikely Bob will reach our $1,000,000 minimum.
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  John's offer provides a guaranteed $1,000,000, making further negotiation with Bob financially unwise. 

It's time to cut our losses with Bob and secure the guaranteed profit with John."
