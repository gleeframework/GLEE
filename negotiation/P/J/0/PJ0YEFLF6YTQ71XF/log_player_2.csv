**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save money. Alice's new offer is better than her previous one, but it's still above Bob's ideal price. Rejecting allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially reach a price closer to his desired $1,200,000."
