Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find something similar for less. I am willing to pay up to $120 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but the quality of this product is truly exceptional and I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $150?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the value of the product, but I'm still looking to keep my expenses down. Could we negotiate at $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 
This is a good time to accept Bob's offer. While you could try to negotiate further, $140 is a significant profit above your minimum ($120).  Continuing to haggle risks losing the sale altogether."
