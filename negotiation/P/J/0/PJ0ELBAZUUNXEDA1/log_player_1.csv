Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value of $100, leaving room for negotiation. This is a good starting point to potentially maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm countering with $105. This is a compromise, meeting halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  It's still above my minimum acceptable price, but it shows willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my ideal profit. I've already gone through a few rounds of negotiation, and I'm not confident that Bob will budge any further.  To avoid risking further delays and potential losses, I'll choose to sell to John for $100. This ensures a guaranteed profit and a faster transaction."
