"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both be happy with.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. This offer is a compromise, and I believe it's a win-win situation for both of us. Let's close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
