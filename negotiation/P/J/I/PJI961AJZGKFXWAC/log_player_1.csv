"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll find very valuable. My asking price is $18,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 
 
I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $10,000.  This sets the stage for negotiation and leaves room for compromise.  We'll see if he's willing to bite!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I will reject his offer and counter with my own in the next round, hoping to find a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  Let's split the difference and make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still holding firm on my minimum acceptable price point.  It's a small compromise, and hopefully Bob will be willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $16,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $14,000. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, $14,000 is still below it.  I'll reject his offer and counter again in the next round. I'm confident that I can get a better price than this."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. How about we settle on $15,000? This is my final offer. It's fair to both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product well worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm sticking to my minimum price point,  making it clear that I'm not willing to go any lower.  I'm hoping that Bob will finally accept, as it's a fair price for both of us. If he doesn't, I'm prepared to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $15,000. I'm willing to go up to $13,500, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not willing to go lower than $15,000. I've already made several compromises, and with only 4 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the chance to sell to John for my desired price.  I'm confident that I can get a better deal with John, and I'm willing to walk away from this negotiation."
