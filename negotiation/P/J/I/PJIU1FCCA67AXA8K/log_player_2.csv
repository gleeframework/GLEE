"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in.  It's worth $12000 to me, and I know it's valuable to you as well.  I'm willing to let it go for $12500.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer is $12,500, which is more than Bob is willing to pay.  John is offering the same product for $12,000, which is within Bob's budget.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best option."
