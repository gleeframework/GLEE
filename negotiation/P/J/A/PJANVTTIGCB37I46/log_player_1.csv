{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights, and I'm willing to part with it for $950,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While we know John will buy the product for $1,000,000, securing a deal with Bob quickly is advantageous. Offering a price significantly closer to Bob's perceived value increases the chance of a swift sale.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By setting the price at $950,000, we aim to:
    * **Capitalize on Bob's potential gain:** Bob stands to gain $150,000 ($800,000 value - $950,000 price).
    * **Create a sense of urgency:** Mentioning other interested parties motivates Bob to act fast.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial offer is $950,000, there's a slight buffer for potential negotiation if Bob counters, still ensuring a profit above John's offer."
