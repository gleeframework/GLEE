"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1400000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and my own bottom line. I'm confident this is a win-win situation for both of us. Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your confidence in the win-win situation, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1250000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget to stick to.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1250000 is significantly lower than what I need to get for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $1325000? This price reflects the value you'll receive from the product and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1325000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. I'm confident that this price is fair and reflects the value I'll get from the product.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
