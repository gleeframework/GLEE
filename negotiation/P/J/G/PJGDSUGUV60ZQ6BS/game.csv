"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $100 is tempting, it's a bit too low for me to let it go at this time.  I'm still willing to negotiate. How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. Would you consider $105?",105.0,Bob,4,
