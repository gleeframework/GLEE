"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $12,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By offering $12,000, I'm leaving room for Bob to counter-offer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price within the 10 rounds.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  The knowledge that I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me confidence in holding firm if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $9,500 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While $9,500 is lower than my initial offer, it's a good starting point for further negotiation.
* **Time is on My Side:** I have 8 more rounds to reach a more agreeable price with Bob. I don't want to settle too quickly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,500 is a step closer, it's still quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. Let's meet in the middle at $11,000. This price reflects the value of the product and still gives you a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm counteroffering with a price that is a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlight Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the higher price.
* **Staying Firm:**  I'm not budging significantly below my $15,000 minimum.
* **Time Pressure:** With 7 rounds remaining, I want to keep moving towards a resolution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,200 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, $10,200 is still far too low for me. 
* **Negotiation in Progress:**  It's clear Bob is willing to negotiate, and I want to see if I can get him to budge higher.
* **Time is on My Side:** I have 6 rounds left to get a better deal. I'm not in a hurry to settle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit. However, $10,200 is still quite a bit lower than my expectations. Let's split the difference and go with $10,600. That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10600}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to Negotiate:** I'm showing flexibility by counteroffering again, but not giving in too quickly.
* **Splitting the Difference:**  This tactic aims to find a middle ground that feels more agreeable to both of us. 
* **Urgency (Softly):** I subtly emphasize the need to reach a deal by mentioning ""getting closer.""
* **Maintaining My Minimum:**  $10,600 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but $10,600 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,300 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Not There:**  While Bob's offer is inching closer, $10,300 is still below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  I believe that with more rounds of negotiation, I can secure a price closer to my ideal range.
* **John as a Backup:**  I'm confident that I can sell to John for $15,000 if necessary, giving me the flexibility to continue negotiating with Bob. 
* **Time is on My Side:**  I have 4 rounds left to get a better offer from Bob. I'm not in a hurry to settle."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. Let's meet halfway again at $10,450.  It's a fair compromise that shows our commitment to reaching a deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10450}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to Negotiate:**  I'm showing Bob that I'm open to finding a solution. 
* **Splitting the Difference:**  I'm once again offering a price that is in between my last offer and Bob's. 
* **Emphasis on Compromise:**  I'm highlighting the compromise to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Maintaining Value:**  I'm still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Time Pressure:**  With 3 rounds left, I need to start pushing towards a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $10,450. I'm willing to pay $10,250 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  With only 2 rounds left, I'm running out of time to negotiate with Bob.
* **Not Meeting Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $10,250 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **John Offers a Secure Deal:**  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees a significant profit and eliminates the risk of further negotiations that may not yield a satisfactory result.

It's better to secure a guaranteed $15,000 from John than risk ending up with less from Bob in the remaining rounds."
