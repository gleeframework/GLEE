,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you consider my offer?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,500 is a step closer, it's still quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. Let's meet in the middle at $11,000. This price reflects the value of the product and still gives you a good deal. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,200 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",10200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit. However, $10,200 is still quite a bit lower than my expectations. Let's split the difference and go with $10,600. That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?",10600.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer. Let's meet halfway again at $10,450.  It's a fair compromise that shows our commitment to reaching a deal. What do you say?",10450.0,Alice,7,
