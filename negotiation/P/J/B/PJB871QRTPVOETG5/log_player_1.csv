Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first because I believe it could be very beneficial for you. I'm asking for $11,500.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money from Bob as possible, knowing that John provides a guaranteed $12,000 fallback.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but below your absolute minimum ($12,000) allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Appeal to Bob's Potential Gain:** Highlighting the product's benefit to Bob might make him more amenable to a higher price, even if it's slightly above his perceived value. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. He might try to negotiate, or he might reject it outright. However, this strategy gives Alice the best chance to maximize her profit."
