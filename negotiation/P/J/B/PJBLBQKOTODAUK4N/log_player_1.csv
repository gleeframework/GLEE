Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within a budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
