Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing my potential profit and ensuring a sale.  Here's why:

* **It's more than my minimum:** I'm getting $2,000 more than my minimum acceptable price, which is a good outcome.
* **It's attractive to Bob:** The price is still below Bob's perceived value of $12,000, giving him a potential gain of $2,000. This increases the likelihood of him accepting the offer.
* **It avoids risk:** If Bob rejects, I still have a guaranteed sale to John for $8,000. 

By offering $10,000, I'm striking a balance between maximizing my potential profit and minimizing the risk of losing a sale."
