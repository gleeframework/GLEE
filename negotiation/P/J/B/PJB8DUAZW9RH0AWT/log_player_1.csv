Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering the product to you for $119.  I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible while still exceeding my minimum selling price ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While I start high, the message implies I'm open to discussion, potentially leading to a price Bob finds acceptable.
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, I'm secure knowing John will buy it at my minimum acceptable price."
