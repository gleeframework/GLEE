"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $100 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I'll reject Alice's offer since I can buy the product from John for $150, which is less than Alice's offer of $120 is not a good deal for me.
