Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're asking for more than your minimum price of $80, which is important for maximizing profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  $100 is significantly lower than Bob's perceived value of $120, allowing for potential bargaining and a mutually agreeable price. 
* **It's a fair offer:** It's not too aggressive, giving Bob an incentive to negotiate rather than outright reject your offer.

Remember, you can adjust your offer and negotiating tactics based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is above your minimum, it's still significantly lower than the $100 you initially offered, and closer to your minimum of $80.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counter-offer and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95, which I think is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $95 is closer, but I'm trying to stick to a tight budget. Could we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, it's strategically advantageous to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Meeting in the Middle:** $90 represents a compromise and a reasonable midpoint between your last offer of $95 and Bob's offer of $85.
* **Avoiding Further Negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price or a stalemate.  Accepting ensures a sale and avoids the risk of a breakdown in negotiations.
* **Profit Over Risk:**  While $90 is not your ideal price, it's still a profit for you and a good deal considering Bob's initial rejection of your initial offer.  Selling to John for $80 would result in a lower profit."
