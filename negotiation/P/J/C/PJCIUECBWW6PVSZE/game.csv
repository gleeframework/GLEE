"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $15000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time.  I'm interested in buying but I'm only able to offer $10000 right now. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13500. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm firm on my offer of $10000. If you're willing to consider that, I'm happy to finalize the deal. ",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're firm on your offer of $10000, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $12500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,
