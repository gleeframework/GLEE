"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $12,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $11,500, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $12,800. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",12800.0,Alice,5,
