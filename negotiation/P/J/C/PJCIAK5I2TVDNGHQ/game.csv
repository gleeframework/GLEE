"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and gives you a good profit margin. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and still gives me a good profit margin. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $1,150,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,100,000? This would be a good deal for both of us, as it's within my budget and still gives you a healthy profit.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your proposal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,125,000. This is my final offer, and I hope you can meet me in the middle.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
