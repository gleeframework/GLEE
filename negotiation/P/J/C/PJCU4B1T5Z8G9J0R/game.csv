"I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price for this product, considering its value to you is $800,000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer is more reflective of that.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,050,000. I'd like to propose a compromise at $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to stay closer to my initial offer of $900,000.",950000.0,Bob,4,
