,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to cover my costs. Let me know if you're interested.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but  $9,800 just doesn't work for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go down to $10,150. This would be a great deal for both of us, as it's closer to your offer, but still allows me to cover my expenses. What do you say?",10150.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll add $150 to that, making it $9,650. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",9650.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're sticking to your price, but I can't go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $9,900. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",9900.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to go up to $9,800, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",9800.0,Bob,8,
