"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $1200000 simply doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to come down to $1500000. This price reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and would still allow us both to benefit from the deal.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1500000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1200000, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1300000. Can we discuss this price?",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering $1400000. It's a fair price that gives us both a good deal. What do you say?",1400000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1400000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1250000. Can we discuss this price?",1250000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While I understand your perspective, I'm still not comfortable with $1250000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $1350000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing us to move forward with the transaction.  What are your thoughts?",1350000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $1350000. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $1200000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
