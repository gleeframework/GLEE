"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you, and I'm aiming for a price around $22,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's a good idea to reject and start counter-offering to see if you can get a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $22,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go as high as $10,000 right now. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm willing to go.  Could you meet me halfway at $16,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While $16,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your limit. Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer allows you to keep negotiating for a better price. You might be able to get closer to your $8,000 target."
