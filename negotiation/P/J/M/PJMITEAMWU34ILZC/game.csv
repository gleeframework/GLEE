"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $22,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go as high as $10,000 right now. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm willing to go.  Could you meet me halfway at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
