"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This still leaves a good profit margin for you and allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $8,000. How about we meet in the middle at $8,250? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",8250.0,Bob,4,
