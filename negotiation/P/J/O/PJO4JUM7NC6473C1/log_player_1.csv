"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to maximize my potential profit. This is a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate.  If he rejects, we can then adjust the price based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safe option, I believe I can potentially get a better price from Bob through further negotiation. I will proceed to round 3 and counter Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm counter-offering with $1,200,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this compromise will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer, even though it's closer to my minimum acceptable price.  I'm motivated by the possibility of getting even closer to my target price.  I'll continue negotiating with Bob in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm counter-offering with $1,050,000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, but still higher than Bob's latest offer. I'm aiming for a middle ground, hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a little more to secure it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied.  There are only a few rounds left, and I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more. I'll continue negotiating with Bob in the next round, hoping to reach a price that's closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

With only a few rounds left, I'm making a final push with a counteroffer of $950,000. This is a significant compromise, but I'm hoping it will be enough to secure a deal with Bob.  If he rejects, I'll have to make a difficult decision in the next round about whether to accept his next offer or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell to John for $1,000,000.  We're down to the final two rounds, and Bob's offer hasn't improved significantly.  While I'd love to get a higher price, I need to be realistic about the potential of securing a better deal with Bob in the remaining rounds.  Selling to John ensures a guaranteed profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price."
