"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$75 is a good price, but I can likely get it lower.**  I'm willing to pay up to $120, so there's room for negotiation.
* **I have 10 rounds, so I can afford to be patient.**  There's no need to rush into a deal. 

I'll try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 60} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** A $15 reduction from Alice's initial offer is a significant drop, showing my willingness to negotiate. 
* **Leaves room for compromise:** I'm still willing to pay a decent price, so Alice has some room to counter without feeling like she's losing too much.
* **Sets the tone:** I'm starting with a lower price, hoping to quickly establish a lower range for the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $70
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still above my target price.** While $70 is better than $75, I'm still aiming for a lower price closer to my $60 counteroffer. 
* **I have rounds to spare:** There's no need to rush into a deal. I'll continue to negotiate. 

I'll send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 65} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** Alice has moved down from $75 to $70, showing some flexibility. I'm meeting her halfway by increasing my offer from $60 to $65. 
* **Maintaining pressure:** I'm still below her offer, but I'm showing a willingness to compromise, hoping to nudge her closer to my price.
* **Testing the waters:**  This counteroffer allows me to gauge if Alice is willing to meet me closer to the middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $72
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still too high.** While $72 is a slight improvement, I'm still not comfortable with the price.
* **I have more rounds to play:**  I'm not feeling pressured to accept this offer. I'll keep negotiating. 

I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 68} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the middle:** Alice's offer of $72 is only $4 away from my last offer of $68. This shows a clear desire to find a compromise. 
* **Demonstrating willingness to negotiate:** I'm demonstrating that I'm taking her offers seriously and am willing to move closer to her position.
* **Testing the waters for a final deal:**  I believe this offer could be the final one before I resort to John. If Alice rejects, I'll likely accept her next offer or go to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $74. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $74
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than my target price.**  I'm not willing to pay more than $70, and Alice is now asking for $74. 
* **I have limited rounds left:** I'm in round 7, and I'm not confident I can get Alice to budge significantly lower. 
* **John's offer is a safe haven:**  While it's not my ideal price, it's within my budget and a guaranteed deal.  

I'm choosing to buy from John to avoid the risk of further negotiation and potentially losing out on the product altogether."
