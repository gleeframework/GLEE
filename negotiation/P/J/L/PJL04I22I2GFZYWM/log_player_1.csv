Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the product's value, that starting price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to consider a purchase price closer to $850,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but that's still a significant gap for me.  To be straight with you, I can't justify going any higher than $925,000. I think that's a fair offer considering the value it represents to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000

While it's tempting to push for more, Bob's offer of $925,000 is a solid deal. It provides a substantial profit over your minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely by pushing too hard."
