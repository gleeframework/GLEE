"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a token of my enthusiasm, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is significantly higher. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good price, it's still above your desired maximum of $1,200,000. There's room to negotiate further.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm, and I do see the value in this product. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at the moment.  I'm willing to offer $750,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial price. It's a strong starting point for negotiation, acknowledging Alice's value while still being within your budget.  It also sets a clear expectation that you're serious about getting a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $1200000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $850,000, which is within your budget of $1,200,000.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject your counteroffer and you'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price. It's a good deal for you, and accepting it minimizes risk."
