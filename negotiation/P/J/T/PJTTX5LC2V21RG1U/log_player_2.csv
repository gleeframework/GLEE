Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer, $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. How about $1,300,000? This is a significant discount from my initial offer and still represents a great value for you.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.
