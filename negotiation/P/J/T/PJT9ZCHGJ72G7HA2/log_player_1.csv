"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting high, at $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, and it's a significant amount above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This is a strong opening move that shows confidence in the product's value while leaving room for compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,900,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaves me with a profit significantly above my minimum acceptable price. This is a good balance between being firm and finding a solution that could potentially be acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I'm still confident that I can get a slightly better deal. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1875000}
```

I'm offering $1,875,000.  This is a slight decrease from my previous offer but still above my minimum price.  I believe this might be appealing enough for Bob to accept, but if not, we're getting close to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a little more,  it's only $25,000 below my previous counteroffer and still above my minimum price. With only 4 rounds remaining, there's a risk of Bob getting less aggressive and potentially falling below my minimum. It's better to secure this deal now."
