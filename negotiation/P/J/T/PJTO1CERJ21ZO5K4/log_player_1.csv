Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product, and I appreciate your offers. However,  $1,050,000 is still too low for what this product can do.

Round 8
Bob's offer:

This is a tough call.  Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still a bit too low for me.  I have only two rounds left, and I don't want to risk losing too much money.  I'm going to take the safe route and sell to John for $1,000,000."
