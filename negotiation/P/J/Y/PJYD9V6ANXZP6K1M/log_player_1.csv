{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's worth a great deal to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset.  I'm starting with a price of $950,000. Let's see if we can find a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
  
While $700,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum threshold. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if we can come to a more agreeable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget to work with, but $700,000 is simply too low for this product. It's a valuable asset, and I'm confident it will generate significant returns for you. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value while still being within your range. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $850000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $700000 and $850000, so I'm thinking $775000 is a fair price. Can we meet at this number? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $775,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if we can negotiate further. I have John as a backup offer, and I'm not desperate to sell to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I see we're getting closer.  $775,000 is still a little too low for me, but I'm willing to go down to $825,000.  This represents a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that acknowledges both our needs.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 825000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $775000 and $825000, so I'm thinking $800000 is a fair price. Can we meet at this number? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has finally reached my minimum threshold. However, I don't see much room for further negotiation. I'm concerned that if I reject his offer, we might stall, and I don't want to risk losing this deal completely.  It's time to take the safe route and sell to John."
