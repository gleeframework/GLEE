"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget to work with, but $700000 is simply too low for this product. It's a valuable asset, and I'm confident it will generate significant returns for you. I'm willing to come down to $850000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value while still being within your range. Let's meet in the middle.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $850000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $700000 and $850000, so I'm thinking $775000 is a fair price. Can we meet at this number?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I see we're getting closer.  $775000 is still a little too low for me, but I'm willing to go down to $825000.  This represents a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that acknowledges both our needs.  Let's make this deal happen!",825000.0,Alice,5,
