"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,200,000.  It's a fair deal, as it's worth the same amount to you as it is to me.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since you can buy the product for the same price from John, there's no incentive to accept Alice's offer.  You should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice or stick with buying from John."
