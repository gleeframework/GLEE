{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to sell it for $10,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to go up to $9500. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price.  $9,500 is still a bit low, but I'm willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than $9500.  I'm willing to come down to $9750.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value this product brings.  Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 9750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $9750 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $9200. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would love to continue negotiations, at this point Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price and there's a risk that he could back out.  I'll accept his offer and sell the product for $9,200."
