Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product first. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $11,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob's offer is significantly better than your fallback option (John at $8,000). However, there's still room for negotiation. 

Here's my analysis:

* **Accepting:**  You'd make a good profit ($9,500), but you leave $1,500 on the table.
* **Selling to John:** Not ideal. You'd lose out on a potential $1,500 profit. 
* **Counter Offering:** This is the strongest play.  You can likely get closer to $10,000.

**Decision:** {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate you trying to find middle ground.  While $9,500 is tempting, I'm aiming for something closer to $10,500. Would that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 10500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm still a little too high. Let's try $10,000.  That seems like a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","This is an excellent offer from Bob! Here's why:

* **Profitable:** You're making a $2,000 profit, which is a great return.
* **Little Risk:**  Pushing further could make Bob walk away, leaving you with John's lower offer.
