Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, there's a chance to earn even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still leaves room for negotiation. It creates the impression that the product is highly valuable.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message is phrased to encourage discussion and potential counter-offers from Bob. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance:

* **If Bob accepts:** You secure a profit above your minimum.
* **If Bob negotiates:** You have room to lower the price slightly and still make a substantial profit.
* **If Bob rejects:** You move on to John, confident in your guaranteed sale price."
