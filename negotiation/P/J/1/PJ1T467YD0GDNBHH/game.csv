This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a fair offer.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I believe the price could be more aligned with the current market. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the market value, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,200,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
