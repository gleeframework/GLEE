"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,300,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a fair offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I believe the price could be more aligned with the current market. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $1,000,000."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the market value, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,200,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is now offering the product at her own valuation. It's unlikely she'll go any lower, and this price is well below your maximum and John's offer.  It's a good deal!"
