"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire something truly unique.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you acknowledging the product's value to me. However, I'm currently looking to spend a maximum of $1,000,000 on this product.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that figure?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
