"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire something truly unique. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob.  While it's tempting to accept, Bob can do better by making a counteroffer.  There's a good chance Alice will accept a lower price, as it's still better for her than selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you acknowledging the product's value to me. However, I'm currently looking to spend a maximum of $1,000,000 on this product.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that figure?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but it's still more than Bob is willing to pay. At this point, Bob is better off going with John, who is offering the product for his maximum price.  There's no guarantee that Alice will continue to lower her price, and further negotiation might just waste Bob's time."
