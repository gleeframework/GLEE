"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit too high for me at the moment. I'd be willing to buy it for $650,000.  Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $650,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the product's value to you. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? I believe this is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for countering.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle at $725,000? I believe that's a fair offer considering we're both trying to find a good deal here.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $725,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to move closer to your target. How about we meet at $850,000? I think this is a fair compromise that takes into account the product's value to you, as well as my own minimum price.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $775,000.  This is a strong offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us.",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $775,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about we settle at $875,000? I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you, and I'm willing to make a compromise to get a deal done.",875000.0,Alice,7,
