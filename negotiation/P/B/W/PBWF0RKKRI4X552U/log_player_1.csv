"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit margin.  I'll see how Bob reacts to this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum, but I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}

I'm going to meet Bob halfway, but I'm still aiming for a profit.  $13,500 is a reasonable compromise and hopefully he'll see that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still not ready to accept Bob's offer.  It's close to my minimum, but I'm going to see if I can get him to budge a little more before I settle for that price.  I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

I'm dropping the price to $12,500, which is still above my minimum and a good compromise. Hopefully, Bob will accept this offer and we can finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

It's getting risky to keep negotiating.  Bob's offers are getting lower and I'm worried I might end up with a worse deal than what John is offering.  It's time to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
