"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its unique value and features, I'm asking for $22,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $22,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $18,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you recognizing the value of this product.  While $18,000 is a bit lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $20,000 to make this deal happen.  This price reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $20,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $17,500. I believe this price is more reasonable and still reflects the value of the product.",17500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $17,500 is cutting it too close to my bottom line.  Let's settle this right now. How about $19,000, and we have a deal? This offer is only valid for this round, as I have other interested buyers.",19000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $19,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $18,750. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.",18750.0,Bob,6,
