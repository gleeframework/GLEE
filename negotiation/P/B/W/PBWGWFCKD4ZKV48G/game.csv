"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for both of us - you get a fantastic product at a fair price, and I get a good return on my investment. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget of $15,000. Can you meet me halfway?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $13,000? This would still give you a significant discount, and we could both walk away happy.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down. However, $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $13,000. How about $12,500? That would be a great compromise for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,4,
