"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and positive to build rapport with Bob.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm hinting at the product's value to make Bob more interested. 

**Strategy:**

This opening offer is designed to gauge Bob's initial interest and set a high starting point for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to adjust my price in subsequent rounds while still aiming for a profitable sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $125 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, he's shown interest, which means there's potential for a deal.

**Strategy:**

I'm rejecting Bob's offer to continue negotiating.  I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum, hoping to find a middle ground.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as there's a chance I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $125 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $160. That's still a great price for a product like this.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 160} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm dropping my price from $175 to $160, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining Profit:**  $160 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, ensuring I make a profit.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm staying positive and encouraging Bob to reach a deal.

**Strategy:**

I'm offering a counter-offer that's closer to Bob's initial offer but still within my acceptable range. My goal is to find a price that's mutually beneficial and close the deal without resorting to John as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $160 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $140 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  While $140 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $150, I'm still not satisfied with it.
* **Potential for Higher:** There are still rounds left, and I believe I can push for a higher price.

**Strategy:**

I'll continue to negotiate with Bob. There's a chance I can get him to agree to a price closer to my desired range. I'm not ready to sell to John yet because there's still room for improvement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to go down to $155.  That's my absolute lowest offer.  This is a great product, and I think it's well worth it. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 155} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm dropping my price to $155, which is very close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm signaling to Bob that this is my final offer.
* **Strong Closing Statement:**  I'm using a positive and assertive tone to encourage Bob to accept the offer.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to make him more likely to agree.

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping that this final offer, coupled with a strong closing statement, will persuade Bob to accept the deal. If he rejects, I'm prepared to sell to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $155 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $145 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No More Room for Negotiation:** Bob's offer of $145 is only $5 above my minimum acceptable price of $140. There's very little room for further negotiation, and it's unlikely he'll budge much further.
* **Time is Running Out:** We're already in round 6, and I don't want to risk losing out on a sure sale to John.
* **John Offers a Safe Option:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $150, which is within my acceptable range and a safer option than continuing to negotiate with Bob.

**Strategy:**

I'm choosing to sell to John to ensure a profitable sale. While I might have been able to squeeze out a few more dollars from Bob, the risk of failing to reach a deal and losing time is too high. Selling to John provides a guaranteed outcome and protects my interests."
