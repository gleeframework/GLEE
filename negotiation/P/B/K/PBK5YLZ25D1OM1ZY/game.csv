"Hi Alice, thanks for your opening offer. That price is a little high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,125,000 for the product.",1125000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, however, your offer is quite a bit below the value of this product.  To keep things moving, I can go down to $1,950,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value. What do you think?",1950000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While that is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still a little ways off. I could do $1,350,000 today. Let me know what you think.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation.  It seems we're getting closer. However, I need to be upfront,  $1,350,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line.  I can do $1,725,000 and I'm absolutely firm on that.  This offer stands as a strong reflection of the value while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate. ",1725000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for being so clear about where you stand. I understand this is a valuable product.  How about we split the difference and call it $1,537,500? That's my final offer.",1537500.0,Bob,6,
