,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $900,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $900,000 is significantly below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but let's meet in the middle.  I'll offer you the product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,000,000. Would you consider selling the product to me for $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 still doesn't work for me. I'm willing to compromise further. How about $975,000? This is a good deal for both of us, as it's a fair price for the product's value.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $960,000, but no higher. Would you consider selling the product to me for $960,000?",960000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. While I'm willing to make a final compromise, $960,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm offering you the product for $970,000.  This is the best price I can offer, and I think it's fair considering the product's value to you.",970000.0,Alice,7,
