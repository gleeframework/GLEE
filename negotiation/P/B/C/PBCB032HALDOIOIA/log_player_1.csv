Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Our goal is to get as close to $150 as possible while ensuring Bob is likely to buy.
* **John as Backup:** We have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John, so we don't want to go lower than that.
* **Appeal to Value:**  The message highlights ""great deal"" to nudge Bob towards accepting.

By starting at $140, we leave room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer."
