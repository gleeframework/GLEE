{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd find very valuable. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that's above my minimum ($8,000) but still leaves room for negotiation, knowing Bob values it at $12,000.  I'm hoping to strike a deal that's mutually beneficial and earns me a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. Could we perhaps agree on a price closer to $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm tempted to accept Bob's offer,  I believe I can still negotiate a higher price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, but still lower than Bob's perceived value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000? It's still a great deal for you, considering you value it at $12,000."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget and the value I place on the product, would it be possible to reach an agreement at $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, and is higher than John's offer of $8,000.  It's time to close the deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
