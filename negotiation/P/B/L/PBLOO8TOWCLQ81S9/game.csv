"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $10,500 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm trying to be fair here.  $11,000 is cutting it close to my bottom line, but I'm willing to accept $11,750.  This is my final offer.",11750.0,Alice,5,
