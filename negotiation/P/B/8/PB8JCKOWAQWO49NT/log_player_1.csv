Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $95. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible. While you could offer it for $100 (its value to John), there's a chance Bob will pay slightly more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $95 leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's really interested, but still ensures a profit for you. 
* **Beat Bob's Valuation:** The price is still higher than Bob's $80 valuation, but it's close enough that he might be tempted if he perceives the product as valuable or rare.

**Important Note:**  There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, this strategy balances risk with the potential for a higher profit than selling directly to John."
