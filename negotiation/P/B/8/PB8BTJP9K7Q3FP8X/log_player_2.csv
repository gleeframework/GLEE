"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming for the best possible price, and $130 is still above your maximum budget. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you're aiming for the lowest price possible, start with a bold counteroffer at $110. This leaves some room for negotiation while still being below your maximum budget. It's also a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, showing your willingness to bargain."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget than her initial offer, it's still above your target price of $120.  There's still room to negotiate, and you should try to get a better deal.  You still have time to counter before buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to your target price, but it's still $5 above what you're comfortable paying.  This counteroffer compromises by moving halfway between her offer and your previous counteroffer. It shows a willingness to meet her halfway while still advocating for a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now significantly higher than your budget.  At this point, it's clear that she's not willing to negotiate down to a price you're comfortable with.  You have enough rounds left to negotiate, but it seems like the bargaining is going in the wrong direction.  Buying from John guarantees you get the product at your maximum price and avoids potentially wasting more time with Alice."
