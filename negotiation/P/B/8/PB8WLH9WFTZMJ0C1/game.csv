"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but  $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000, which is still a significant amount and reflects the value I see in this product. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a significant amount, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and the initial offer I made.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm really interested in this product and believe it has a lot of value. I'm willing to offer $800,000, which is my absolute maximum. This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product and you to get a quick sale.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your maximum offer of $800,000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the product's value to you and the initial offer I made, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll offer you $850,000, which is my final counteroffer. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it.",850000.0,Alice,5,
