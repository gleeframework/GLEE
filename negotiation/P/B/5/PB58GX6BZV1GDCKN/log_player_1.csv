"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly valuable product. Given its potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a price higher than your desired outcome. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:** While the price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, the message emphasizes the product's ""potential"" to justify the high initial offer. 
* **Open Communication:** The message encourages a dialogue, inviting Bob to share his thoughts and begin the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is the maximum value he places on the product. However, it's equal to your minimum acceptable price. Rejecting now allows you to:

* **Explore Higher Ground:** There's still room to negotiate upwards from Bob's offer. He might be willing to go higher, especially if you highlight the product's unique benefits. 
* **Maintain Leverage:** You still have the option to sell to John for your minimum, so there's no immediate pressure to accept a lower price.
* **Gauge Seriousness:**  Bob's quick jump to his maximum suggests he's quite interested. Your rejection will test his resolve and willingness to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the value. However, the price you're offering doesn't reflect the true potential and scarcity of this product. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,450,000. This feels like a fair reflection of its worth."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** While you rejected Bob's offer, you're showing flexibility by significantly decreasing your initial asking price.
* **Holding Firm:** The counter-offer remains substantially above Bob's initial bid, preserving room for further negotiation.
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message reiterates the product's unique qualities (""potential,"" ""scarcity"") to justify the higher price point. 
* **Seeking Compromise:** By positioning the offer as ""middle ground,"" you signal a willingness to negotiate a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, but I still think $1,200,000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,300,000. This is my final offer, I'm not willing to go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is a significant increase from his initial $1,200,000 and a reasonable compromise from your $1,450,000.
* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** While he might have some wiggle room, it's risky to assume he'll budge significantly from what he's declared as his ""final offer."" 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing negotiations carries the risk of Bob walking away. Accepting now secures a $100,000 profit over your guaranteed sale to John.

It's a good deal at $1,300,000 - better to take the win than potentially lose the sale by pushing for more."
