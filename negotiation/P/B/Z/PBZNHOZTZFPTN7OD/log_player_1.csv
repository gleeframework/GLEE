"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but $9,500 is significantly below my minimum price. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $9,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about we settle on $10,500? This would give us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our offers. How about we settle on $10,250? This would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum, and it's important to close the deal before the rounds run out.  $10,250 is a fair compromise, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John or having to make further counteroffers that could potentially push the deal further away."
