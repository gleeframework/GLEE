"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $95 is my ideal price, I could be persuaded to go down to $88.  I believe this product will be very beneficial for you and $88 is a fair price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but $75 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. I can go down to $83, but that's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $83. 
You have three options:

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly signaling this is her final offer. While we could try to push for a slightly lower price, the potential savings are minimal compared to the risk of losing the deal entirely. At $83, we're still getting a good deal compared to John's $100 price."
