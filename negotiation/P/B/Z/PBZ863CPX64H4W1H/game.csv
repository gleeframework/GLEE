"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you.  It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I know it holds the same potential value for you.  To show my confidence in this deal, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000.  This is a fair price that benefits us both.  If you're interested, let's discuss further.  If not, I'm confident another buyer will be happy to purchase it.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
