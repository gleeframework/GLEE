"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but $120 is a bit high for me.  How about $100?  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that 120 might be a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. How about we meet in the middle at 110? It's a fair price that I'm willing to accept, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $95? I'm really interested in this product, and I believe this price would be fair for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that 95 is still a bit lower than I'm willing to accept, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at 105? It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.",105.0,Alice,5,
