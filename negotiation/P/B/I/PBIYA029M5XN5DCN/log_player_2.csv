"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

```

**Explanation:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible. While $120 is better than John's $150, you can likely get a better deal by counter-offering.  Alice is willing to sell for $80, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but $120 is a bit high for me.  How about $100?  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that 120 might be a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. How about we meet in the middle at 110? It's a fair price that I'm willing to accept, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $110 is better than John's offer, we're still aiming to save more.  Alice is willing to sell for $80, so there's still room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $95? I'm really interested in this product, and I believe this price would be fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that 95 is still a bit lower than I'm willing to accept, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at 105? It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $105. This is still a good price, saving you $45 from John's offer. While you could try to counter-offer again, there's no guarantee Alice will budge further.  Accepting her offer is the most sensible choice to save money and get the product."
