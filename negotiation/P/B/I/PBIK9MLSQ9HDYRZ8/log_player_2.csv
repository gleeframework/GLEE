Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer to $400,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, showing Alice that I'm serious about closing the deal. However, it's still below her last offer, leaving room for compromise. If Alice rejects this offer, I might have to consider buying from John, as I'm getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is back to her original offer of $500,000. While I would prefer a lower price, we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  If I reject this offer, I risk losing the opportunity to buy from Alice and being forced to purchase from John for a significantly higher price.  Therefore, I'm going to accept Alice's offer and purchase the product for $500,000."
