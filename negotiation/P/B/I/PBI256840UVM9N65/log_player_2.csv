"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price, considering its worth to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Let's negotiate.  Alice's offer is too high. We have room to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you do $10,000?"",

``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it leaves us room to negotiate upwards if needed.  We're aiming for a price that's significantly below our $15,000 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? That's a significant discount from my original offer and reflects the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is better, we can likely still negotiate a bit lower.  Let's push a little further before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice. I'm getting closer, but $12,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. How about $11,000? That's a fair offer."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

We're inching closer to a potential deal. By countering with $11,000, we're signaling that we're serious but still aiming for a lower price point."
