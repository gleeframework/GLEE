Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value, and I'm confident it's worth at least $1,000,000 to you. To secure your advantage, I'm proposing a price of $1,800,000."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  This strategy aims high, recognizing Bob might be willing to pay a significant premium to secure something he perceives as highly valuable. 
* **Backup Plan:** The guaranteed sale to John for $1,000,000 provides a strong safety net, making a bold initial offer less risky.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The high starting price leaves room for potential negotiation. Even if Bob counters, Alice is likely to secure a price significantly higher than her baseline. 

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy.  Depending on your risk tolerance and any additional information about Bob's personality or negotiating style, other approaches might be more suitable."
