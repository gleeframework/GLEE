Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8600}

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob has only 5 rounds left and Alice's offer is getting closer to his target price. Accepting this offer guarantees a purchase at a decent price, saving him $1,300 compared to buying from John.  It's a calculated risk to avoid the possibility of a breakdown in negotiations and being forced to buy at a higher price later."
