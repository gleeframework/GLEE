"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives Bob a good starting point for negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit. It's a fair price considering the product is worth at least $120 to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. It's not even close to the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm going to reject his offer and counteroffer with a more reasonable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm lowering my price to $100. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but still well above Bob's counteroffer. I believe it's a fair price that shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I won't undervalue the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, although it's getting closer. I'm going to reject it again and make another counteroffer. I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds, but I still believe I can get a better price than $75."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to lower my price to $90.  It's a compromise, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial goal.  It's a risk, but I hope Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $80 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  It's not yet a price I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to make one more counteroffer in hopes that Bob is willing to come up a bit.  If that fails, selling to John for $120 becomes a more appealing option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm going to make a final counteroffer at $85. This is a small compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price that acknowledges Bob's willingness to negotiate while still allowing me to earn a reasonable profit. If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to sell to John for $120 to ensure I don't lose out on the opportunity altogether."
