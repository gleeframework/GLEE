"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $150 to you, and we're willing to sell it to you for $130. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You want to save as much money as possible.  While $130 is a good deal, you can potentially get it for even less. It's worth exploring further negotiation before going with John's $150 price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I'm looking to pay closer to $110.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:**  A $110 offer is significantly lower than Alice's original price, but it's still higher than her value of $100. This shows you're serious about buying but willing to negotiate.
* **Sets the stage:** By offering a specific price, you encourage Alice to consider a counteroffer, keeping the negotiation moving. 
* **Room for compromise:** This price leaves room for some back and forth, potentially leading to a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. After considering your offer, I believe we can find a middle ground. I would like to propose a price of $120 for the product. This still allows us to maintain a fair profit while being more reasonable than my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $120, which is a good deal for you. It's still within your budget of $150 and is a reasonable compromise.  There's a good chance you could negotiate further, but accepting at this point avoids risking the deal falling through or having to buy from John at a higher price."
