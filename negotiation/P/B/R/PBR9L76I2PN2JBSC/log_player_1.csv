**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, your goal is to see if you can get even more from Bob.
* **Finding a Sweet Spot:** Offering the product between Bob's value ($1,000,000) and your minimum ($1,200,000) creates a potential win-win.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price of $1,150,000 gives Bob a significant discount while still netting you a profit above your guaranteed sale. 
* **Exclusivity Incentive:**  By highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity,"" you add a subtle pressure point that might encourage Bob to act quickly."
