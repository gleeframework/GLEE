"I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $145? That way we both get a good deal.",145.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $145 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $130, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $130?",130.0,Bob,4,
