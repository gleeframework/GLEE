Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. I know it's worth more to me, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** By starting at $175, I set a high initial price. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed. 
* **Appealing to Bob's interest:** The message emphasizes that I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us, making it seem like I'm open to negotiation.
* **Knowing my backup:**  I have John as a backup buyer willing to pay $150, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob is unwilling to meet my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is significantly lower than my minimum price of $150, and even lower than what John is willing to pay. 
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:**  I want to see if I can get a better price by making a counteroffer.  It's likely Bob is willing to pay more than $120.
* **Leveraging John's offer:**  Having John as a backup buyer gives me confidence to reject Bob's offer and negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $145? That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle (somewhat):** This counteroffer is a compromise, offering a price halfway between my initial $175 and Bob's $120.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Still above my minimum:** $145 is still above my minimum price of $150, but it's closer to Bob's offer, making it more likely he'll accept.
* **Positive messaging:**  The message highlights that this offer benefits both of us, increasing the chances of acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $145 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $130, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $130 is still below my minimum price of $150, and John is willing to pay more.
* **No significant room for negotiation:** There isn't much room left for negotiation; another counteroffer from me might lead to a stalemate. 
* **Guaranteed profit with John:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and a faster transaction. 

It's better to secure the guaranteed $150 from John than to risk further negotiations with Bob."
