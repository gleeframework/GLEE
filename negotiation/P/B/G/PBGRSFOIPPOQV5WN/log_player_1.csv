Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but it's lower than what John is willing to pay.  This gives Bob an incentive to accept the offer, as he still saves $100,000 compared to buying from John.  It also ensures that I maximize my profit, as I'm getting more than what I would get from John."
