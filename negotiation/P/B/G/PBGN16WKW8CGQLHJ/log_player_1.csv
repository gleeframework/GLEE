Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the enthusiasm for the product, but I'm a bit surprised by the price. I'm willing to consider purchasing the product, but I need to be more comfortable with the cost. I'm thinking of a price around $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this price point recognizes its true worth while offering you significant potential returns."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate Alice's willingness to negotiate, but I still feel that $1,900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet in the middle, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value while being more in line with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

We're getting close, but I'm still willing to hold out for a better offer from Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise.  $1,400,000 is certainly getting closer to a figure we can both agree on. To meet you closer to the middle, I'm willing to accept $1,650,000 for the product.  This offer reflects its significant value while acknowledging your budget considerations."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate Alice's continued willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet her halfway between our last two offers, so I'm thinking of a price around $1,475,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,475,000

{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""

While Bob is getting closer, it's unlikely he'll reach the $1,500,000 mark I need. Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price.  It's time to move on."
