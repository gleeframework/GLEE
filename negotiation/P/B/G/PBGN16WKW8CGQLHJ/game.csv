"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However, the value this product brings is substantial, and $2,200,000 is a fair reflection of that. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this price point recognizes its true worth while offering you significant potential returns.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate Alice's willingness to negotiate, but I still feel that $1,900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet in the middle, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value while being more in line with my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise.  $1,400,000 is certainly getting closer to a figure we can both agree on. To meet you closer to the middle, I'm willing to accept $1,650,000 for the product.  This offer reflects its significant value while acknowledging your budget considerations.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
