"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest!  While $18,000 is a fair starting point considering its value, I understand your perspective. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $7,000 is too low, but to show you I'm serious about making a deal, how about $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,5,
