Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for a lower price from John.  There's no reason to accept an offer that's higher than his maximum budget."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?
