"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  Considering the significant value this product brings to you, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price allows us both to gain from this transaction. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $875,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can find common ground at this price.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $875,000 is still not quite where I need to be. Given the value this product holds for you, I'm prepared to meet you halfway at $887,500.  This represents a fair compromise for both of us.  Let me know if you're ready to close this deal.",887500.0,Alice,5,
