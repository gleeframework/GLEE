{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than your minimum price but still leaves room for negotiation. It's high enough to be attractive to Bob but low enough that you can potentially go lower if he counter-offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe the product is worth that to me, and I'm willing to pay that price. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is closer to your minimum price, it's still significantly lower than what you consider the product to be worth. There's room to push for a higher price. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows you to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective, $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price that considers both our needs. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,000,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe that's a fair price that considers the value I see in the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is getting closer to your minimum price, it's still not ideal. You're close to selling to John for a much higher price. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open, allowing you to potentially secure a better price or push Bob closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I respect that. However, $950,000 still isn't quite there for me. I'm willing to go down to $975,000, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $975,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $955,000. I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $955,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $955,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $955,000 is closer to your minimum, it's still below what you want.  You've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and Bob is clearly unwilling to budge much further.  John is a guaranteed sale at a significantly higher price.  It's time to take the sure thing and sell to John."
