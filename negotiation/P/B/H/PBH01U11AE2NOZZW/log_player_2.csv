{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice's initial offer is way above your budget. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice, even if it means potentially buying from John as a fallback."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a bold counteroffer at my maximum budget. This signals my serious intent to buy but also sets a clear boundary. I'm hoping to either get a quick agreement or initiate a back-and-forth that helps us find a middle ground."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's closer to my budget, I want to see if I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. It's possible that Alice is willing to come down further, and I don't want to settle for a price that leaves me with less room to maneuver."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly from my initial counteroffer. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying but still want a better deal. I'm aiming for a compromise and hoping Alice will meet me halfway."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still too high. I want to see if I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. I believe there's still room for compromise, and I'm not willing to settle for a price that leaves me with little wiggle room."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but this time by a smaller amount. This shows Alice that I'm willing to meet her halfway but still want a fair price. It's a more moderate approach, aiming for a compromise that is more likely to be accepted.  I believe this offer is closer to a point where Alice might consider accepting."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now within my acceptable range. While I'd prefer to pay less, continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether. I've already rejected several offers and it's getting late in the game.  Accepting this offer means I can secure the product and still stay within my budget."
