"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair for both of us. How does $12000 sound? It's a significant discount from what it's worth to you, and still allows me to get a good price for it. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
