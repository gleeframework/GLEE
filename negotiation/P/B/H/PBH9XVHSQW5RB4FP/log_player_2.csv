"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should try to lower the price further."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested,  $950,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let me know if you're open to negotiating further."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that 950000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. How about we discuss a price of 900000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but it's still too high for Bob's goal of saving as much as possible.  Bob should continue negotiating to try to lower the price further."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's try $875,000.  This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we discuss a price of 887500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $887,500 is close to Bob's last counteroffer of $875,000. While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will walk away or increase the price.  At this point, accepting the offer is the best option to secure the product at a good price, especially since it's significantly lower than John's offer of $1,000,000."
