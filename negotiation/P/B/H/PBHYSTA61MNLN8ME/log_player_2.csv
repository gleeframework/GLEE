"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate from here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's starting offer is a good sign, but it's way too early to accept. There's plenty of room for negotiation. I should start with a counteroffer significantly lower than my $1,200,000 maximum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider a price closer to $650,000?"",
""product_price"": 650000
}
``` 

This counter-offer accomplishes a few things:

* **Shows Interest:** It acknowledges Alice's offer and expresses continued interest in the product.
* **Establishes a Lower Range:** By countering with a significantly lower price, it sets a new starting point for negotiation and signals willingness to negotiate.
* **Leaves Room for Compromise:** It doesn't go too low and leaves space for further negotiation towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $650,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to consider a revised price. After careful thought, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $850,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but that's still a big gap.  Let's see if I can nudge her closer to my range before considering accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate the movement, but $850,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  Could you meet me somewhere around $725,000?"",
""product_price"": 725000
}
```

Here's why this counteroffer makes sense:

* **Acknowledges Progress:**  It recognizes Alice's willingness to negotiate by lowering her price.
* **Continues Negotiation:** It shows you're still interested in finding a price that works for both of you.
* **Aims for the Middle Ground:** By suggesting $725,000, it pushes towards a compromise closer to the middle of the current negotiating range. 
* **Keeps John as a Backup:**  It's getting closer to John's price, but there's still room to negotiate with Alice before considering that option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $850,000 is still a bit above your budget, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to meet you at $800,000, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with. This is already a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

This is a good deal! Alice has come down significantly, and $800,000 is a great price compared to John's offer.  It's time to accept and seal the deal!"
