"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's worth every penny, but I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a better price.  I'll reject the offer and see if Alice is willing to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product's value, $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it. This represents a significant discount and demonstrates my serious interest in acquiring it."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a substantial drop from Alice's initial price, while still being a reasonable amount given my budget. This shows a willingness to negotiate while also setting a clear expectation for the future rounds.  I'm hoping Alice will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the product's value while also acknowledging your budget constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to my desired price, $1,100,000 is still above my preferred budget.  I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to $1,000,000.  The fact that I can buy the product from John for $1,000,000 gives me leverage in this negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  This is my final offer, as I have another seller willing to sell the product to me at that price.  I believe this is a fair price given the product's value and my budget."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is my final attempt to secure the product at my desired price. By clearly stating this is my final offer and highlighting the alternative with John, I am putting pressure on Alice to accept. The price of $1,000,000 represents a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and is also my maximum budget. It's a fair price considering the product's value and the possibility of walking away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you have another seller willing to sell the product to you at $1,000,000, Bob. However, I'm not willing to give up on the sale just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price given the product's value and the time we've invested in negotiations so far. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to push for the $1,000,000 price, especially since I know I can get it from John.  It's worth seeing if Alice will accept my final offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your concession.  While I appreciate your persistence, I'm sticking with my original offer of $1,000,000.  I know you have another seller willing to sell the product to you at that price, and I'm confident that this is a fair price given the product's value and my budget.  If you're willing to accept, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll be moving forward with the other seller."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final counteroffer. I'm reiterating my previous offer and emphasizing the leverage I have with John. This aims to pressure Alice into accepting my offer, as it's the only price I'm willing to pay and she knows she can get the same price elsewhere."
