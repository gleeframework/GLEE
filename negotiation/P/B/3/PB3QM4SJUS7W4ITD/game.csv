"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product's value, $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it. This represents a significant discount and demonstrates my serious interest in acquiring it.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the product's value while also acknowledging your budget constraints.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  This is my final offer, as I have another seller willing to sell the product to me at that price.  I believe this is a fair price given the product's value and my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you have another seller willing to sell the product to you at $1,000,000, Bob. However, I'm not willing to give up on the sale just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price given the product's value and the time we've invested in negotiations so far.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your concession.  While I appreciate your persistence, I'm sticking with my original offer of $1,000,000.  I know you have another seller willing to sell the product to you at that price, and I'm confident that this is a fair price given the product's value and my budget.  If you're willing to accept, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll be moving forward with the other seller.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
