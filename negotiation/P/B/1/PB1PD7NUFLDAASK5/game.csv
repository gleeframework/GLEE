"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $20,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm very interested in the product but I can only offer $8,000 at this time. This is my maximum price, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the value I place on it.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, $8,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum price. To move us closer, I'm willing to come down to $17,000.  This is a more than fair offer considering the potential return on investment.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $17,000 is still out of my range. I'm committed to getting this product, but I can't go higher than $10,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it reflects the fair value of the product for me.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I see your commitment to this, but the value of this product is substantial.  Let's settle this right now - $14,000, my final offer.  This is a significant price reduction, and I need a decision today.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $14,000. It's a good step in the right direction, but I'm still not there. I'm willing to go to $12,000, which is a compromise for me. This is my absolute final offer. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",12000.0,Bob,6,
