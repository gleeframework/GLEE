"Alice,  $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering your valuation.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me to accept. This product holds significant value, and I'm confident it can bring you even more than your initial assessment.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your position. However,  $1,100,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,090,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
