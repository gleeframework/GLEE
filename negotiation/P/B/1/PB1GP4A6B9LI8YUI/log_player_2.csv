"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially even more so than to me. I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is too high.  Bob can potentially get a better price by negotiating with Alice, or as a last resort, buy from John for $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering your valuation.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me to accept. This product holds significant value, and I'm confident it can bring you even more than your initial assessment.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save money. While $1,100,000 is a better offer than Alice's initial price, it's still too high. Bob can continue negotiating with Alice in hopes of reaching a lower price. There's still room for a compromise before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand your position. However,  $1,100,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,090,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,090,000 is getting closer to Bob's desired price range. It's still higher than Bob's last counteroffer of $1,075,000, but it's a significant decrease from Alice's previous offer of $1,100,000.  Given that Alice is stating this is her final offer, and Bob has limited rounds remaining, it's prudent for Bob to accept the offer and avoid the risk of further negotiation leading to a higher price or the need to buy from John at an even higher cost."
