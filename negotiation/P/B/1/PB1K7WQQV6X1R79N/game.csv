"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price. While $9,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to come down to $13,500. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $11,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",11000.0,Bob,4,
