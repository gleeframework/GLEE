"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you. However, I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a great compromise, considering its value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad to hear that we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $9,500. This is my final offer, as I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,5,
