Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm afraid $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $7,500.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty, but I'm not willing to go down to $7,000. However, I'm willing to compromise again. I can offer you the product for $7,250, but this is the last time I'm willing to budge. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding firm at $7,250 and has indicated she won't budge further.  Since John offers the product for $8,000, it makes more financial sense to cut negotiations with Alice and buy from John.  While continuing to negotiate with Alice might yield a slightly lower price, it's risky, and the potential savings are minimal compared to John's guaranteed offer."
