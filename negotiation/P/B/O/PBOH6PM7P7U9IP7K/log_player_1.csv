Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,750,000. This is above his perceived value of $1,000,000 but leaves room for negotiation. 

Here's the strategy:

* **Starting High:**  I'm aiming high to maximize my potential profit. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $1,750,000, I create space for Bob to counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John will pay $1,500,000 gives me confidence to hold firm if Bob doesn't meet my expectations.  I'm not desperate to sell to him.

This approach balances the need to get a good price with the risk of losing the deal.  I'm ready to counteroffer if needed, but I'm also prepared to walk away if Bob is too far off from my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. It's also far lower than the price I initially offered ($1,750,000). While it's tempting to take $1,000,000, it's not worth sacrificing my desired profit.

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:**  I won't accept anything less than $1,500,000 for this product.
* **John's Offer:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a guaranteed option, and I don't want to risk losing that.
* **Negotiation Opportunity:**  While Bob's offer is too low, it opens a space for counter-offering. I can try to meet him halfway, but I won't settle for less than my minimum.

By rejecting Bob's offer and counter-offering, I can potentially secure a better price. I'm ready to walk away and sell to John if negotiations don't go my way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counter-offering Bob at $1,250,000. This is:

* **Higher than Bob's offer:**  This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not completely cave to his low price.
* **Lower than my initial offer:**  I'm demonstrating flexibility and willingness to find a middle ground. 
* **Above my minimum:** This price still allows me to make a profit and stay above my minimum acceptable value.

**Strategy:**

* **Finding a Middle Ground:** I'm aiming for a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This is a common negotiation tactic. 
* **Keeping the Pressure On:**  While I'm reducing my price, I'm not accepting his initial offer, signaling that I'm still confident in my product's value.
* **Preparing for More Negotiations:**  I'm expecting Bob might counteroffer again. If he does, I'll be prepared to adjust my offer accordingly. 

This counter-offer is a step in the right direction, keeping the negotiation moving while still aiming for a favorable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, it still falls short. I'm not willing to compromise my financial goals just yet.

**Reasoning:**

* **John's Offer:**  I have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay $1,500,000. This gives me a strong fallback position.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Bob's offer shows he's willing to negotiate further. There's still room for him to increase his offer.
* **Minimizing Loss:**  Rejecting his offer now allows me to potentially secure a better price without significant risk.

**Next Steps:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation and attempt to secure a price closer to my desired value. I'm prepared to make another counteroffer, but I'm also willing to walk away and sell to John if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counter-offering Bob at $1,150,000. This is:

* **Higher than Bob's offer:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise but still aiming for a better price.
* **Lower than my previous offer:** This shows flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Closer to Bob's offer:**  This indicates I'm starting to see the potential for a deal.

**Strategy:**

* **Bridging the Gap:**  My counteroffer is a smaller increase from Bob's last offer, making it more likely he'll see it as a reasonable compromise.
* **Testing the Waters:** I'm gauging Bob's willingness to pay more. If he accepts, I've secured a good price. If he rejects, I'll need to reassess my strategy.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  This price is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, ensuring I don't lose too much profit.

This counteroffer represents a compromise, but it still allows me to maintain a strong negotiating position. I'm prepared to adjust my offer further depending on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While I would prefer to earn more than $1,500,000, Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is simply too low.  I've already lowered my price significantly from my initial offer and Bob still seems unwilling to meet me halfway. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees me a profit above my minimum acceptable price. There's no risk involved.
* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  Bob's repeated rejections suggest he's not willing to pay a price closer to my desired value. 
* **Time and Effort:**  Further negotiations could be time-consuming and may not lead to a significantly better outcome.

It's time to cut my losses and move on. I'm confident that John will be a reliable buyer and I can avoid further hassle and potential losses."
