Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm willing to let it go for $175, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, we can start lowering the price, keeping in mind our minimum value of $150, and John's guaranteed offer as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand your value for it, but my budget is limited. Would you consider selling it for $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is our minimum acceptable price.  While we could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee we'll get a better price, and we risk losing Bob entirely. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and meets our minimum goal."
