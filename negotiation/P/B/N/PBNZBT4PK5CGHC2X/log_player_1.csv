"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to get the best possible deal. If Bob rejects, I'll adjust my price accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
``` 

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still aiming for a profit margin. I think this price is fair considering the value to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $95 is getting close to my desired price, and I'm worried that if I continue to reject his offers, I might lose the deal completely. Selling to John for $100 is an option, but it's not as good as $95. So, I'll accept Bob's offer."
