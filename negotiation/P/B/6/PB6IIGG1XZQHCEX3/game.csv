"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",850000.0,Alice,3,
