Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking $10,000 for it.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000:** This is a starting point that's higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.  
* **Message:** I'm trying to be friendly and positive, highlighting the value of the product while keeping the price high enough to maximize my potential profit. 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting high because I don't know Bob's valuation.  If he's genuinely interested, he may be willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, it's better to know his counter-offer and assess his true interest level.  

**Important:** This is just a starting point! Based on Bob's response, I'll adjust my strategy, potentially lowering the price if necessary, but always keeping in mind my minimum value and the option of selling to John as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price.  While I would prefer more, accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation, which could lead to a lower price or even a rejection.  There's also the chance that John might not be available or change his mind. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Guaranteed Sale:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and guaranteed sale.
* **Minimum Value:** $8,000 is my absolute minimum, so accepting doesn't result in a loss.
* **Uncertainty of Future Negotiations:**  There's no guarantee that I can get a better price by rejecting Bob's offer and counteroffering. 

**Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the most practical and risk-averse decision in this situation.**"
