Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in purchasing the product, but $1,750,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. This price still reflects its value to me, but it's more in line with my financial constraints. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
