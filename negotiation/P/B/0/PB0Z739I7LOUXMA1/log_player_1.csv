"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but it gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary. I want to gauge Bob's initial interest and see if he's willing to play at this price point.  I'm confident the product is worth more than $1,500,000 to me, so I'm not afraid to start high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,800,000 is a good price, I believe I can still get closer to my initial asking price. I'm confident the product is worth more to Bob, and I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,900,000.  This is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding out for a higher price.  I want to see if Bob is truly interested in the product and if he's willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I think there's still room for negotiation and I'm willing to see if I can squeeze out another $50,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1850000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,850,000.  This is a small decrease from my previous counteroffer, but it shows I'm willing to compromise.  I'm hoping this will get Bob to accept, as it's only $100,000 away from his last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $1,700,000.  We've been going back and forth for a while now, and I'm starting to run out of time. While I would love to get closer to my initial asking price, this is a good deal and I'm happy with the outcome.  It's above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, and it's clear that Bob is not willing to go much higher."
