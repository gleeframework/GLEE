Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

This offer is strategically calculated:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:** You're aiming for a good profit, but not pushing Bob to the edge.
* **It's lower than Bob's valuation:** This gives Bob a clear incentive to buy, as he'll still make a profit. 
* **It's higher than John's offer:** You're still getting a good deal, ensuring you're not losing money if Bob rejects the offer.

This approach maximizes your chances of securing a higher price while also maintaining a good chance of a successful sale."
