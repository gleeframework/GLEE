Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm still confident I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, while I appreciate your interest, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial price. How about $1,350,000? This is a fair price considering the value the product offers you."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $1,325,000? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,325,000 is close enough to my desired price and a better deal than selling to John.  I'll accept it and move on."
