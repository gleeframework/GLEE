"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. We're open to negotiating a fair price. Our initial offer is $800000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's initial offer of $800,000 is significantly below your maximum budget of $1,500,000. There's room for negotiation and you can likely get a better price. It's too early to consider buying from John at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, we're willing to meet you halfway. Our new offer is $1100000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is closer to your desired price point, but there's still room for negotiation.  You can likely push for a lower price, especially since you're willing to pay up to $1,500,000. It's too early to consider John's offer as you're getting closer to your target price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still hoping to get closer to $1,050,000.  Let's keep working towards a deal that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your persistence, Bob. We're willing to make another concession. Our new offer is $1030000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,030,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,030,000 is very close to your desired price point, and it's much better than John's offer of $1,500,000.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a good chance Alice won't go lower, and you risk losing the deal entirely.  Accepting her offer at this point ensures you get the product at a good price while saving a significant amount of money."
