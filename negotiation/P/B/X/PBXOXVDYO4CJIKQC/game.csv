,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $10,000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $12,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for this exceptional product.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate your willingness to work with me.  While $12,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still stretching my budget a bit. How about we settle at $11,500? That would work well for me.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. However, $11,500 is still a bit lower than I'd like. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $13,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for this exceptional product.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm afraid $13,000 is still outside my budget.  To be completely transparent, I've found a similar product for $15,000. However, I prefer yours and I'm willing to make one final push. If you can do $12,250, we have a deal.",12250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty about the similar product, but I'm glad you still prefer mine. I'm willing to meet you halfway on the price, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm counteroffering at $13,500. This is as low as I can go, and I'm confident it's a price that reflects the value of this exceptional product.",13500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $13,500 is still pushing my budget too far.  I need to be realistic about my spending. I'll offer you a final price of $12,100.  If this works for you, we have a deal, and you can consider it sold.  If not, I'll need to move forward with the alternative option.",12100.0,Bob,8,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to be realistic about your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $12,100 is still a bit lower than I'd like. Considering we're getting close to the deadline, I'm willing to make one last concession. I'm counteroffering at $13,000, which is my absolute minimum. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",13000.0,Alice,9,
