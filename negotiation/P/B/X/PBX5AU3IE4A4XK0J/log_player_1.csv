Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a price slightly above the product's value to Bob, but not too high to scare him away.  We'll see if he bites or if we need to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low.  It's significantly below my minimum price of $800,000.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to at least get $800,000 for it. Let's meet in the middle - how about $750,000?"", ""product_price"": 750000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with a price halfway between my minimum and Bob's offer.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm firm on getting a price closer to the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $750,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about we split the difference again and settle at $725,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $725,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'd like to receive. The negotiation is getting tedious, and John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum price.  It's time to cut my losses and move on to a sure thing."
