Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm able to go right now. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product. This is my absolute top price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","While Bob's offer matches the product's base value, it's still early in the negotiation. Let's see if we can nudge him a little higher.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,000 is still out of my range.  I'm really looking for something closer to my initial offer of $8,000.  Would you consider that?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
