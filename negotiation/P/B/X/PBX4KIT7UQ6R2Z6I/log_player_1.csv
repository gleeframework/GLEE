Round 6

{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're getting close to John's offer, but there's still room for negotiation. Bob's counteroffers are slowly increasing, suggesting he's willing to pay more. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open and allows for a potential deal closer to our desired price."

**Reasoning:** Bob has met our minimum acceptable price. There's no guarantee we can negotiate a higher price, and it's not worth risking the deal by continuing. Accepting Bob's offer secures the sale at the best possible outcome given the circumstances."
