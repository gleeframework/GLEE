"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $170 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $170 is a bit high, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $125? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  While $125 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $100?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $100 is still a bit low for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to compromise further. How about we meet at $115? I think that's the best we can do at this point.",115.0,Alice,5,
