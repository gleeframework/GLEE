"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. This is a great deal, considering its value to me is at least $15000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer is above Bob's maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to John."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you thinking of me.  I'm interested, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for it, which is still a great deal for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $15000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $16500. It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair middle ground. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $16,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum of $15,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if Alice will budge.  Since John is willing to sell for $15,000, Bob has a solid fallback option."

Alice's final offer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000. While it's closer than before, it's not worth risking further negotiation. Bob has a guaranteed deal with John for $15,000."
