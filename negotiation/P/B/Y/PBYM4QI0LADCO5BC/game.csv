"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000. I hope this aligns better with what you're willing to consider.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget considerations, however, the value of this product is quite high, and $1,300,000 falls a bit short.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I am still working within a tight budget. Could we perhaps aim for $1,325,000? This feels like a fair compromise considering the value of the product to me.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
