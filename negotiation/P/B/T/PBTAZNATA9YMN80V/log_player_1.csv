Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,250,000.  Let me know your thoughts and if you'd like to discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, there's room to negotiate with Bob for a higher profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $1,250,000 sits comfortably above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still presents a significant discount from John's offer. 
* **Open Communication:** The message is framed as an opportunity for Bob, encouraging a dialogue and potentially revealing his willingness to negotiate further.

**This strategy aims to:**

1. **Secure a Sale Above Bob's Valuation:** By positioning the price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, we aim to anchor his perception of the product's worth.
2. **Leave Room for Negotiation:** The offer allows for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a final sale price above his initial $800,000 valuation. 
3. **Maintain a Safety Net:**  We retain the security of John's offer at full value if Bob declines."
