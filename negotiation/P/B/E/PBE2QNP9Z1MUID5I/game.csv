"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth your consideration. Let me know what you think!",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get closer to $1,000,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? I believe this price is fair for both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1,025,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $990,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in between.",990000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $990,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little more to $1,005,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it would be a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know what you think!",1005000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,005,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer, so I'll counter with $997,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",997500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a fair price.  While I appreciate your offer,  $997,500 is still slightly below what I need.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This price is fair for both of us, and it would allow me to move forward with this deal.  I'm hoping we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
