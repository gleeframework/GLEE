* You are aiming to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still higher than your desired price.
* It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice to see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm aiming to get as close to Alice's desired price of $1,000,000 as possible while still leaving some room for negotiation. 
* This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, showing I'm serious about getting a deal.
* It's likely Alice will counter back, but this gives us a starting point for further negotiation."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is within my budget of $1,200,000.
* While I would prefer to pay less, further negotiation might not result in a significantly lower price.
* Accepting this offer ensures I acquire the product for a reasonable price without risking the opportunity to buy from John for a higher cost."
