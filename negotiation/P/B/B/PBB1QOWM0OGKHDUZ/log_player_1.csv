Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product could be incredibly valuable to your operations, potentially saving you significant costs in the long run. I'm willing to offer it to you at a very competitive price of $1,350,000."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  While Bob values the product at $800,000, Alice knows its worth much more to her. Starting with a high price anchors the negotiation in her favor.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The offer leaves room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and they can potentially settle on a price higher than his initial valuation.
* **Alternative Buyer Security:** Alice has the security of John as a buyer. This allows her to be firm in her negotiations with Bob, knowing she has a guaranteed sale at her minimum price. 

**Goal:**  Alice aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while ensuring she doesn't lose him as a buyer, leading to a potentially lower but guaranteed sale to John."
