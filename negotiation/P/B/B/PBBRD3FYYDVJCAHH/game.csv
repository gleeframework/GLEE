"I understand you're still looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle at $13000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll find it's a great value.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your honesty, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I've already made concessions, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $13500, which is the lowest I can go. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",13500.0,Alice,7,

"I understand you're trying to find a compromise, Bob, but I've already gone lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one last offer: $14000. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",14000.0,Alice,9,
