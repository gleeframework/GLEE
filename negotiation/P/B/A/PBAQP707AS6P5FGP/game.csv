"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand it's a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",100.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer, Alice.  How about $75? That's a fair compromise, I think.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a compromise, Bob. However, $75 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more offer. I'll give you a deal for $110, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's still a great price for the product, and I think you'll really benefit from it.",110.0,Alice,5,
