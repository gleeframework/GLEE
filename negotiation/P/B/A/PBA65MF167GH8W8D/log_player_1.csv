Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning he has a potential profit of $500,000 if he buys from you at your minimum. 
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000. This is your leverage.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the offer.  A price too close to $1,500,000 leaves little room for Bob to see value, risking rejection. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product. Considering its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will significantly benefit you. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  You confidently position the product as valuable and ""exclusive.""
* **Strategic Price:** $1,350,000 offers a good balance:
    * You earn a significant $350,000 profit above your minimum.
    * Bob still gains a potential $150,000 profit.
* **No Justification:**  You don't need to justify the price. Let Bob analyze the value proposition himself.

**Important Notes**

* **Negotiation:**  Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer.  You can slightly lower your price, but don't go below $1,100,000. 
* **Confidence is Key:**  Present your offer confidently. If Bob senses hesitation, he may push for a lower price."
