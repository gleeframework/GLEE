"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own a high-quality item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. This is a fair price considering its value and the benefits it can bring to you.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate you taking the time to explain the product's value. However, $18000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $14000 for the product.  This is a fair price given my budget and the value I see in the product.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14000. Considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $16500. This is a compromise that I think is fair for both of us.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $16500 is closer to my budget, I'm still not able to go that high. My final offer is $15500.  This price reflects the value I see in the product and is the absolute maximum I can afford. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to look elsewhere for a similar product.",15500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your final offer, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $15500. Considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm offering a final counteroffer of $16250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for the product, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",16250.0,Alice,5,
