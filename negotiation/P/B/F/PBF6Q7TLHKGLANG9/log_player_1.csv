"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm asking for $15,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum ($12,000) but still potentially attractive to Bob if the product is valuable to him.
* **Positive message:** I'm keeping the message upbeat and focused on the product's potential value to Bob. This sets a positive tone for the negotiation.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm not being rigid with the price, but rather opening the door for further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $12500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum:** While I'm willing to sell for $12,000, I want to see if I can get a bit closer to my initial asking price. 
* **More negotiation room:** Rejecting allows me to counteroffer and potentially close the deal at a price higher than $12,500.
* **Ten rounds:** I still have a lot of negotiation rounds left, so there's time to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but $13,500 is the lowest I can go at this point.  This product is truly unique and offers a lot of value.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is closer to Bob's offer:** I'm moving closer to Bob's price but still keeping some margin for negotiation.
* **Highlighting product value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth, hoping to justify my price point.
* **Seeking compromise:** The message shows flexibility and openness to finding a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product is unique and valuable, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my desired price:** At $13,000, Bob's offer is very close to my desired price point and significantly higher than selling to John.
* **Limited rounds:** With only 6 rounds remaining, it's important to consider the possibility of not reaching a better agreement. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:** Rejecting Bob's offer could lead to more negotiation rounds with no guarantee of a higher price, especially given his willingness to meet me halfway.
* **Opportunity cost:**  Taking $13,000 now minimizes the risk of ending up with $12,000 from John."
