"Alice's offer: The product price will be $999,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $999,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is very close to your maximum budget, and there's no guarantee you'll get a better deal by rejecting.  It's likely that Alice is willing to sell for a price just below $1,000,000, so accepting her offer is the most logical choice to save money."
