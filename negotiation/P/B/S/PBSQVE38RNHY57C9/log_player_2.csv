"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, potentially even more than my initial assessment. To kick things off, I'd like to propose a starting price of $1,300,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price, but I believe the value this product brings to your business is significantly higher. It's a unique opportunity that doesn't come around often. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,175,000. This represents a significant discount on its true value.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,175,000 is still too steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This shows my commitment to making a deal, but it's important that we find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the significant value this product will bring to your business.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000.

I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
