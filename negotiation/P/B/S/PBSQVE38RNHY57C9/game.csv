"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, potentially even more than my initial assessment. To kick things off, I'd like to propose a starting price of $1,300,000. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price, but I believe the value this product brings to your business is significantly higher. It's a unique opportunity that doesn't come around often. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,175,000. This represents a significant discount on its true value.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,175,000 is still too steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This shows my commitment to making a deal, but it's important that we find a price that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the significant value this product will bring to your business.  Let's close this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this product. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
