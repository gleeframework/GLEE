"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $140 is within his budget, it's not the best deal.  He can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $140 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob wants to start low, but not so low that Alice immediately rejects the offer.  
* **Negotiation:**  $125 is a reasonable starting point, giving Alice room to counter without feeling like she's losing too much.
* **Value:** Bob is still offering a price that is above Alice's minimum (worth of $120), suggesting he's genuinely interested in the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $135. It's a great compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. 
* **Finding the Middle Ground:**  Bob can likely get a better price by continuing the negotiation. 
* **Risk:**  While buying from John is an option, it's the most expensive solution. Bob is better off continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $135 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $130? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Bob is offering a compromise, demonstrating his willingness to meet Alice halfway.
* **Fair Price:** $130 is a price that is reasonable for both parties, and it shows that Bob is serious about the deal.
* **Closing the Deal:** By offering a price that's closer to the middle ground, Bob aims to incentivize Alice to accept and close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to split the difference, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $135 and $130. How about we try $132.50? It's a fair compromise that still gives me a decent profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** While Alice has come down in price, she's still higher than Bob's target. 
* **Finding the Middle Ground:** Bob can still get a better price by continuing the negotiation. He wants to get the price as close as possible to $130.
* **Risk:**  Buying from John would be more expensive, and Bob still has time to improve the offer from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $132.50 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping we can land on $131. That would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the purchase."", ""product_price"": 131}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:** Bob is making a small counteroffer, showing he's willing to negotiate but also sticking to his desired price point.
* **Staying Focused:**  He's aiming to get the price as close to $130 as possible.
* **Closing Pressure:**  By offering a final price, Bob is putting pressure on Alice to accept and close the deal."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $132.50 and $131. How about we try $131.25? It's a small concession, but it's still a decent profit for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $131.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $131.25
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice is now very close to Bob's target price of $130.
* **Continuing the Negotiation:**  While $131.25 is a good price, Bob wants to try and get that last bit of savings.
* **Risk:** Buying from John would be more expensive. The negotiation is moving in Bob's favor, so it's worth continuing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This price is a good compromise and very close to his target of $130.
