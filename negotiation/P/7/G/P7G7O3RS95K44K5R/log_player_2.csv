{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Since the goal is to save as much money as possible, it's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price. Rejecting Alice's initial offer allows for negotiation and potentially a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it sets the stage for negotiation. If Alice is willing to sell for less than $1,200,000, she'll likely counter with something closer to my offer. If she rejects, we can adjust accordingly in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,100,000 is better than $1,200,000, there's still room for negotiation. I'm going to reject Alice's offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, moving from $1,200,000 to $1,100,000.  I'm increasing my offer slightly to $1,050,000. This shows I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still pushing for a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is now offering $1,075,000, which is a good deal compared to John's price of $1,200,000.  There's always a chance of getting an even lower price, but it's getting late in the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing the product. I'm going to accept Alice's offer and save $125,000."
