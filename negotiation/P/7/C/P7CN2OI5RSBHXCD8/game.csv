"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I have to consider my own needs, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $11,000.

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my financial constraints. I hope you'll reconsider.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're committed to your budget, Bob, and I respect that. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $11,000. I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal - I'll include a one-year warranty and a free maintenance package. This is a unique opportunity to get a great deal on a high-value product. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the extras, but my budget is still fixed at $10,500. I'm willing to take the product without the warranty and maintenance package if it helps us reach an agreement.  I'm confident this deal is beneficial for both of us.  Let's make it happen!",10500.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're willing to forgo the extras, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,500 and $11,000, which is $10,750. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for the product. What are your thoughts?",10750.0,Alice,7,
