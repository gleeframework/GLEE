I'll reject Bob's offer for $75. While it's close to my minimum, I can still potentially get a better price from him.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer for $80. It's my minimum price, and it's a good deal for both of us.  I'd rather sell to Bob than go through more negotiation rounds, especially considering I could just sell to John for the same price."
