Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you. I'm asking for $1,300,000. Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:**  Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,300,000 vs. $800,000) sets a strong anchor. This may make Bob more receptive to a slightly lower price later.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The offer leaves space for negotiation while still staying well above your minimum acceptable price.
* **John as Leverage (Unspoken):** While you don't want to explicitly threaten Bob, the fact that you have a guaranteed buyer at a higher price gives you leverage.  This allows you to be firmer in your negotiations.

**It's important to note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob based on his response."
