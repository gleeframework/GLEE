# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $200. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I don't think the product is worth $200. That's even more than Alice thinks it's worth. I'd like to reject the offer and make a counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'm looking for a good deal, and $200 is a bit too rich for my blood. I'd be willing to pay $120 for the product, but that's as high as I'm willing to go.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but the product is worth more to me than that. How about we meet halfway between our offers at $160? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'm trying to find a sweet spot where both of us can be happy. I think $140 is a fair price for the product, considering its value. I'm willing to meet Alice halfway between $140 and $160, which would be $150. However, I'd like to propose a slight discount to $145, considering the original price Alice had in mind was $200.
