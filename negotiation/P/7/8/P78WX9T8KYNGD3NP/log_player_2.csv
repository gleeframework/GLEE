"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. My initial price is $1,400,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high. You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, and she's starting at $1,400,000.  There's room for negotiation, so it makes sense to reject the offer and counter with a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of this product,  $1,400,000 is higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it, which is still a fair price given its value. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1,250,000 is a good starting point, I'm still a bit away from my desired price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This reflects the value I know this product holds for you and allows for some room for negotiation. Let's keep the conversation going. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your target price, but $1,350,000 is still higher than your maximum.  You can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate, especially since you have 7 more rounds remaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,350,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit more than I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000, and I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and our ongoing negotiations.  Let's try to reach a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer. While I value your offer of $1,300,000, I'm still aiming for a slightly higher figure. How about $1,325,000? This reflects a significant compromise from my side, and it's a fair price given the product's value. Let's make this final offer work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,325,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  You've only got 5 rounds left, and it's unlikely you'll be able to get her down to your target price within that time.  Therefore, it's more advantageous to buy from John, securing the product at your desired price."
