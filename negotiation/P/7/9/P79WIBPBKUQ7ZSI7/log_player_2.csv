"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've been developing for some time and I'm confident it could be a game-changer for your business. I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, but I believe in the potential of our partnership.  If you're interested, let's schedule a call to discuss further. Otherwise, I'll be moving forward with another buyer who's eager to acquire it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
