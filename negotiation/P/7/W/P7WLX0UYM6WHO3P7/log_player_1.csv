"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price close to Bob's perceived value but still leaving room for negotiation. This allows for potential profit while also making Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to build rapport and create a positive atmosphere for negotiation. 
* **Value Statement:** I'm subtly highlighting the product's value to Bob without revealing my minimum price. 

**Remember:** My goal is to maximize profit, but I also need to consider the risk of Bob rejecting the offer and the potential of selling to John for a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $14000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $12,500 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, but it's still below what I'm aiming for. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob has shown interest, and I want to try and secure a price closer to my initial offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While selling to John for $12,000 is a safe option, I'm willing to take a chance and see if I can get a better price from Bob. 

**Next Step:** I'll counter Bob's offer with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm counteroffering with $13,500, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining Value:**  I'm still emphasizing the product's value to justify the price. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the communication positive to keep the negotiation amicable.

**Strategy:**  By counteroffering with $13,500, I'm hoping to find a middle ground that both Bob and I can agree on.  I'm aware that Bob may still be reluctant to go higher, but I'm trying to maximize my profit without risking a deal-breaker."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13500 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $13000. This is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $13,000 is very close to my desired price range.  While I could potentially negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal to John outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price.
* **Compromise:** Bob's offer represents a significant compromise, showing a willingness to meet me halfway. 
* **Time Factor:**  We're nearing the middle of the negotiation rounds. It's important to secure a deal before running the risk of losing time and potentially being forced to accept a lower price from John.

**Decision:**  Accepting Bob's offer of $13,000 ensures a good profit for me and closes the deal before I risk losing the opportunity altogether."
