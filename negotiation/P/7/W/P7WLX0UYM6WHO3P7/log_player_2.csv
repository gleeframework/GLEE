"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $14000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a decent price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. There are 9 more rounds, giving him ample opportunity to try and lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $14,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This counteroffer is aggressive but not outrageous. It's a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's desire to save money.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** By offering $12,500, Bob leaves some room for Alice to counter with a higher price, but still allows for a potential deal. 
* **Focuses on value:**  The message emphasizes Bob's willingness to pay a fair price, highlighting the potential value he sees in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13500. This is a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can make this work! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:** While $13,500 is closer to Bob's target, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay right now. With several rounds remaining, Bob can continue to negotiate and try to bring the price down further.
* **Risk of accepting:**  Accepting at this point might seem like a good deal, but there's a risk that Alice might be willing to go lower with more pressure.
* **Staying the course:**  By rejecting the offer, Bob keeps the pressure on Alice and demonstrates his commitment to finding the best price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,500 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $13,000. This is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small increment:**  This counteroffer shows Bob is willing to compromise but remains firm in his desire for a lower price. 
* **Positive framing:**  The message emphasizes the benefits of a deal for both parties, encouraging Alice to be more flexible.
* **Closing the deal:**  By mentioning closing the deal, Bob adds a sense of urgency and subtly pressures Alice to accept."
