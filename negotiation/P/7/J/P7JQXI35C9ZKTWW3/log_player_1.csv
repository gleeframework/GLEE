Round 2
Bob's offer:

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $980,000 is a smart move. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** It's substantially higher than John's offer of $800,000. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now avoids potential delays and risks of continued negotiation.
* **Strong Position:** Bob keeps increasing his offer, indicating strong interest. Holding out might backfire."
