"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $10,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I'm confident this price is fair for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $10,500 for your product. This still allows me to stay within my budget while acknowledging the value of what you're offering.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints. However, $10,500 is still a bit low for me. Let's aim for a final price of $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway this time.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've considered your proposal and would like to counter with a price of $11,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our positions.",11000.0,Bob,6,
