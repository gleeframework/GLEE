"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this offer.",8500.0,Alice,3,
