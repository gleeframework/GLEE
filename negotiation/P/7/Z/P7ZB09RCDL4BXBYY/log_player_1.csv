"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $180.  It's a great deal for a top-quality item. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price ($150) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the quality of the product to justify the price.
* **Open to Discussion:**  The message ends with a question, inviting Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to try to reach a price closer to my target.
* **John is a fallback option:** While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I know I can get $150 from John if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is just too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $150? That's still a good price considering the quality of the product. "", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm proposing a price in the middle of our previous offers, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasize Value Again:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's quality to justify the price. 
* **Direct and Clear:** I'm stating the price directly and making the offer clear."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you want to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While it's closer to my minimum price, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm hoping to get closer to $150.
* **More room for negotiation:** I think there's room to negotiate further.  Bob is clearly interested in the product, and I want to see if I can push him a bit higher.
* **John is always a fallback:**  It's important to remember that I can still sell to John for $150 if this negotiation falls apart."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $130 is still a bit too low for me. Let's compromise at $140. It's a fair price that reflects the quality of the product, and it gets us closer to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing Compromise:**  I'm again offering a price in the middle of our previous offers, showing a willingness to negotiate while also gradually pushing the price higher.
* **Emphasize Fairness:**  I'm framing the price as fair and reflecting the quality of the product, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Closing the Gap:**  I'm trying to close the gap between our desired prices, making it more likely that we'll reach an agreement in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $135 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the quality of the product and the effort you're putting into the sale. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but not quite:** While $135 is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not happy with it.  I'm hoping to get at least $140.
* **More rounds left:** We still have four rounds remaining, and I'm confident that I can push Bob higher with a counteroffer.
* **John is still an option:** If I don't get a better price from Bob, I can always sell to John for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and we're getting closer. However, $135 is still just a little below where I need to be. Would you be willing to go up to $140? It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it would allow us to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintaining pressure:**  I'm reiterating my desire for a higher price, making it clear I'm not willing to settle for $135.
* **Focusing on fairness:** I'm emphasizing that $140 is fair, aligning my goal with Bob's desire for a good deal.
* **Urgency:** The message subtly implies that I'm getting closer to selling to John, increasing the pressure on Bob to reach an agreement."
