I'm willing to pay $135 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the quality of the product and the effort you're putting into the sale. Can you meet me at this price?,135.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and we're getting closer. However, $135 is still just a little below where I need to be. Would you be willing to go up to $140? It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it would allow us to finalize the deal.",140.0,Alice,7,
