"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $110. This is a bit of a gamble, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay more than the product is worth to him. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'd like to close the deal, I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum of $100. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering $95, which is still above my minimum and closer to Bob's offer.  This shows I'm willing to compromise while still getting a decent price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm confident I can push for a slightly higher offer in the next round. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if he's willing to go up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm offering $90, which is a small compromise from my previous offer.  I'm hoping that this will be enough to convince Bob to accept and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're getting close to my minimum, but I'm starting to feel like Bob isn't going to budge much more. I'm also getting a little concerned that we're running out of time. It's better to be safe than sorry, so I'm going to sell to John for $100.  While it's not the best possible outcome, it guarantees I get my minimum and avoids further risk."
