Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

Bob's offer is below my minimum value, so I will reject it. I will try to counter with a price closer to my minimum value in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
