"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $850,000. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $950,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair for both of us.

Bob should buy the product from John.  Even though Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, he only has one round left, and there's no guarantee Alice will accept his final counteroffer. Buying from John guarantees Bob the product at a price well within his budget."
