"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a valuable product that I believe will be highly beneficial for your needs.  While the true worth of this product is significant, I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000.  This represents a substantial value proposition for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  Let me know if you're interested in proceeding further.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:**  Alice is offering the product for $950,000, which is less than John's price of $1,000,000.
* **It's within your budget:**  The offer of $950,000 is still within your maximum budget of $1,000,000.

Therefore, it makes sense to accept Alice's offer to save $50,000."
