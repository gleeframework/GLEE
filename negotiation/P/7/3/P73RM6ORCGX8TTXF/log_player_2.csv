You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's offer is a bit high. While you're willing to pay up to $12,000, getting the product for less would be ideal. By rejecting this offer, you can see if Alice will come down to a more acceptable price.  You can always fall back on John's offer if needed."
