"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a special price of $950,000. I believe it holds significant value for you, even more so than this offer price reflects. However, I want to be fair and give you the first opportunity to acquire it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, you know you can get the product for $800,000 from John. Rejecting her offer allows you to move forward with the guaranteed lower price, saving you $150,000."
