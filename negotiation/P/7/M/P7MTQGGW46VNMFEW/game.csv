"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the product's true value. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $750,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price that's just a bit higher than that. How about we meet at $800,000? This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",800000.0,Alice,5,
