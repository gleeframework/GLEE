"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is a good price, Bob can still save more money.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to negotiate further and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get as close to his $1,000,000 target as possible.  Offering $1,100,000 is a significant discount from Alice's offer, showing Bob is serious about negotiating. It's a reasonable starting point for further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob can still potentially save more money.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and try to push the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a compromise. He's raised his offer from $1,100,000, showing he's willing to negotiate.  $1,200,000 is still significantly below Alice's offer, and it's possible she'll be willing to accept it to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob wants to save as much money as possible, Alice's offer of $1,280,000 is very close to his target of $1,000,000.  Further negotiation may not yield a significantly better price, and the risk of Alice walking away or Bob having to buy from John at $1,000,000 is too high.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product at a reasonable price."
