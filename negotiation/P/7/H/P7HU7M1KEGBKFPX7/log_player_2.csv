Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,150,000 is still a bit below my desired price point. To make this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $1,162,500.  This represents a significant compromise on my part and would leave us both with a fair outcome.

We're getting very close to John's price, and Alice is likely to hold firm as we're very close to the middle ground. Accepting at $1,162,500 secures a decent discount and avoids the risk of the deal falling through."
