Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John offers a safety net at $1,200,000, aiming higher with Bob is key to maximizing profit.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's room to negotiate above our minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it at $1,400,000 leaves Bob with a potential $100,000 gain if he accepts. This makes the deal very attractive to him. 
* **Leaving Negotiation Room:** This initial offer isn't our absolute ceiling.  If Bob counters, there might be a little wiggle room to still secure a deal significantly better than John's offer."
