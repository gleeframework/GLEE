"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a good deal, it's still possible to get a better price. Alice values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore that potential."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000, I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than $1,000,000. Considering our initial discussion, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand. I'm open to further negotiations, but I believe this price is a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is a significant improvement from her initial price and is within Bob's budget.  It's also above Alice's own valuation of $1,200,000, so it's a fair compromise.  While there's always the chance to try and negotiate further, the risk of getting a worse offer or having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential savings."
