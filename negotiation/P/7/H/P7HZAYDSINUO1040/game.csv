"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000, I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than $1,000,000. Considering our initial discussion, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand. I'm open to further negotiations, but I believe this price is a reasonable compromise.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
