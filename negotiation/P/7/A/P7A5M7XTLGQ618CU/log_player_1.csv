Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd really find it valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $95. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer starts high, but still leaves room for negotiation. It acknowledges Bob's potential value for the product while still securing a profit for Alice."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice should reject Bob's offer.  While $85 is better than selling to John, it's still below her minimum acceptable price of $80.  By rejecting, Alice can continue to negotiate and try to get closer to her desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $90?  That's still a good deal for both of us, and it would let me avoid selling to someone else."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $82.50. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice should accept Bob's offer. While it's only slightly above her minimum, it's still a better deal than selling to John for $80. Further negotiation might be possible, but it's a risk considering Bob's statement that he's at his lowest price."
