"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go as low as $8,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I'm willing to consider your suggestion of $10,000, but I would like to stay within my budget of $8,000. Could we possibly find a compromise that works for both of us?",8000.0,Bob,4,
