"Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product.  While it looks great, $200 is a bit outside my budget. Would you consider $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $175? I think it's a fair price for the quality and value this product offers.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $175 is still a bit high for me.  How about $120? That's a pretty big jump from my last offer.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're trying to negotiate, and I appreciate your persistence! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I can do $155, which is still a bit above my minimum price, but I think it's a fair compromise. Let me know if that works for you.",155.0,Alice,5,
