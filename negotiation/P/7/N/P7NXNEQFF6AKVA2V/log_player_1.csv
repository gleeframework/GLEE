Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $180. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm not willing to go any lower."", ""product_price"": 180}
 
Here's why I started with this strategy:

* **Starting High:**  Beginning with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($120) and my minimum ($150) leaves room for negotiation. It also establishes the product as potentially valuable.
* **Strong Stance:** By stating I'm not willing to go lower initially, I project confidence in the product's worth, potentially anchoring Bob's perception of the price.
* **Leaving the Door Open:**  While firm, my message doesn't shut down the possibility of a counteroffer. Bob now has the opportunity to reveal how interested he is and how much he might be willing to pay. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Bob's counteroffer of $140 is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I'll counter with a price closer to my bottom line, but still above it to allow a small margin for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. I could come down a bit to $165, but that's my absolute lowest price."", ""product_price"": 165}

Here's my reasoning:

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm moving closer to Bob's counteroffer to show willingness to negotiate, but I'm still significantly above his initial offer. 
* **Firm but Fair:**  By stating my ""absolute lowest price,"" I'm aiming to anchor the negotiation closer to my desired outcome while leaving Bob some room to potentially meet me. 

Let's see how Bob responds to this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to buying from John, but I'd rather buy from you. Can you meet me at $145? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

While I'd prefer to get $150, Bob's offer of $145 is only slightly below my minimum, and he seems quite keen on the product. Accepting this offer avoids the risk of him going with John and ensures I make a profit."
