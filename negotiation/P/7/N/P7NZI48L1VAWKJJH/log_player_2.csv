Round 5

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm impressed by your determination, Bob. However, I'm not willing to accept $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price.

It's clear that Alice is not budging from her price range.  While she might come down slightly, it's unlikely she'll go below John's $800,000 price in the remaining rounds.  It's time to cut losses and secure the deal with John."
