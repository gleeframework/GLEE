Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115} 
```

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You've stated your minimum is $100, so this offer is already profitable for you.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** $115 is significantly less than Bob's value of $120, giving him room to counteroffer and potentially find a price that benefits both of you.
* **It's a fair starting point:**  You are not being overly aggressive with a high price, but you are also not selling yourself short."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still below your initial offer and closer to what John is offering. It's worth trying to get a better price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

I'm going to counter with $110. This is still lower than my initial offer, but it's a compromise that reflects Bob's willingness to pay more than $105. This could be a good middle ground and may entice Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is just $3 less than my initial offer and is a good compromise. I'll accept it. There's a risk that he might reject my next counteroffer, and then I might be forced to sell to John at a lower price.  $108 is a decent profit for me, so I'll take it."
