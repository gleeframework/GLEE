"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for a price that allows us both to benefit.  I believe a price of $950,000 would be mutually agreeable.  It's significantly less than its true value to you, and it provides me with a strong return on my investment.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Alice's offer is too high. You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so there's no need to pay $950,000. By rejecting the offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice or proceed with your backup option, John."
