"I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product at a price that I think is a great value for both of us. I'm willing to start at $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider coming down to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,050,000. This is the best I can do for now.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice. How about we settle at $975,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, $975,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $1,025,000. This is my final offer for now.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand this is your final offer, Alice, and I respect that.  To be fair to us both, how about we split the difference and settle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm not ready to give up on getting a better price for this product. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and I'm thinking of a price of $1,050,000 again, but this time it's a take-it-or-leave-it offer. If you're not comfortable with this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
