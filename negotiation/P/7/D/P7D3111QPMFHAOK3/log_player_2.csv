Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm not ready to give up on getting a better price for this product. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and I'm thinking of a price of $1,050,000 again, but this time it's a take-it-or-leave-it offer. If you're not comfortable with this price, I'll have to consider other options.

It's clear Alice is not budging beyond the $1,050,000 mark.  While we could continue negotiating, there's a good chance we won't get a better deal.  John offers a guaranteed price of $1,200,000, which saves us from potential further haggling and risk of losing the product altogether."
