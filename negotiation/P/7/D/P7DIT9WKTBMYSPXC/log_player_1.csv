Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to offer it at a price of $1,100,000.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, it's always best to try for a higher profit. Offering it to Bob first allows me to potentially make an extra $100,000.
* **Strategic Pricing:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but leaving room for negotiation.  
* **Alternative Option:** If Bob rejects the offer, I haven't lost anything, as I can still sell to John at my desired price."
