"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1500000 price point. Would you consider reducing the price to $1000000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $1000000 is significantly below the value I've placed on this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1300000. This would still represent a great deal for you, and I believe you'd see a strong return on your investment. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I understand the value of your product, I am still working within a tight budget. Could you consider $1200000 as a fair offer? I believe this would still provide a good return on investment for you.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
