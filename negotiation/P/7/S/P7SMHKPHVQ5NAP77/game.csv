"I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product at a competitive price of $15,000. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500.  What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,000. What do you think?"
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $12,200. Can we meet in the middle again?",12200.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I understand your position, but $12,200 is still beyond my limit.  I'm willing to go up to $11,500.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,,
