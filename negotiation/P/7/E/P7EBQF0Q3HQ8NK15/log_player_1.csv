"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that the product's value is even higher than Bob's perceived value. 
* **Confident Tone:**  Projecting confidence in the product and the offer can influence Bob's perception of its value.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""mutually beneficial arrangement"" signals to Bob that you're willing to negotiate.

This initial offer allows us to gauge Bob's willingness to pay and sets the stage for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm looking to stay within a tighter budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is a significant amount, it's still below both our minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) and John's standing offer.  We have room to negotiate and try to guide Bob closer to our desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your budgetary considerations, however, the value of this product is truly significant.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,200,000.  I believe this price point better reflects the unique benefits this product offers."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob:**  Recognizing Bob's counteroffer shows you're engaged in the negotiation process.
* **Justifying the Price:** Emphasizing the product's ""unique benefits"" reinforces its value and justifies the higher price.
* **Strategic Concession:**  Lowering the price by $100,000 demonstrates flexibility while still aiming for a price above our minimum. 

We want to see if Bob is willing to move closer to our range, and this counteroffer keeps the negotiation active."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still looking to stay within my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value you've highlighted and my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, which indicates he's interested. However, $950,000 is still below our minimum acceptable price and John's offer. We are in a strong position with John as a backup, so we can afford to continue negotiating for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to accept $1,100,000 for the product. This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to reach a deal."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive and collaborative tone keeps the negotiation moving smoothly.
* **Significant Concession:**  A drop of $100,000 is a substantial move that signals our willingness to compromise. 
* **Finality:** We are getting closer to our walk-away point. By framing this as a significant concession, we are adding weight to the offer and implying we might be reaching our limit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still looking to stay within my budget. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've highlighted and my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly unwilling to meet our minimum price, even with our significant concessions. It's unlikely he'll suddenly jump to $1,000,000 or higher. John's standing offer guarantees us our minimum desired price, so it's time to move on. Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks leaving us with a less favorable outcome if we run out of rounds."
