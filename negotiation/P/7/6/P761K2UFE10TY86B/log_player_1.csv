Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 from John, it's always best to try for the highest possible profit. Bob is willing to pay $8,000, so starting at your minimum acceptable price ($10,000) is a strong opening. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While this scenario doesn't involve back-and-forth negotiation,  starting high leaves space if Bob wants to counter-offer. 
* **Confidence:** Presenting the offer with confidence emphasizes the product's value. 

**Important Note:** There's always a chance Bob will outright reject the $10,000 offer. However, since we have no information about Bob's negotiation style or willingness to pay more than $8,000, it's strategically sound to start at the higher end."
