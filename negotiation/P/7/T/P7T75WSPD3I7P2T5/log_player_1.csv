"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the potential sale of this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing an initial offer of $2,000,000."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's advantageous to begin negotiations with a strong offer above both your minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while setting a high anchor point. 
* **Strategic Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value and potential"" to justify the high price, aiming to frame Bob's perception of the product's worth.

This strategy allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to pay while leaving room to negotiate down if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer. Considering the current market conditions and my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's counteroffer of $1,200,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm better off negotiating further to see if I can secure a better deal.  I have the option to sell to John for my minimum, but there's still room to potentially get a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the market and appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value this product represents, particularly its unique features,  justifies a price closer to my initial proposal. How about we meet halfway at $1,600,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession and Justification:** I acknowledge Bob's counteroffer but stand firm on the product's value. Proposing a price of $1,600,000 represents a compromise (meeting halfway) while still exceeding my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I continue to highlight the ""unique features"" to keep Bob focused on the product's advantages beyond the general market conditions he cited. 

This strategy aims to find a balance between negotiating a favorable deal and potentially scaring Bob off with a price too close to my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to counter your offer with $1,400,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee Bob will go higher, and I risk him walking away. It's a strong offer, and I'd be securing a significant profit."
