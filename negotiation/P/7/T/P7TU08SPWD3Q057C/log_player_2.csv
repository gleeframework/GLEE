"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $50
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$50 is a great price, but since I have 10 rounds, I can try to negotiate even lower. I'll reject and see if I can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 40}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer of $40. It's a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but I'm hoping she'll still see value in selling at this price.  I want to establish a strong negotiating position early on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $55. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $55
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is slightly higher than her initial offer.  I'm still willing to negotiate further, as I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'll reject and see if I can get her to come down closer to my counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 45}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $45. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a price below Alice's current offer. I believe there's room for us to meet in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $60
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now higher than her initial offer.  While it's still below my budget, I'm not comfortable accepting it yet. I'm seeing a pattern where Alice is increasing her price each round. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if she'll budge, but I'm starting to get a little worried about the time running out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 50}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm making one final counteroffer at $50. This is right in the middle of Alice's last offer and my previous counteroffer. It shows that I'm willing to meet her halfway, but I'm also running out of rounds.  If she rejects this, I'll likely have to go with John's offer to avoid getting stuck."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $65
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offers are consistently increasing, and we're running out of time. I've already made several counteroffers, and she's clearly not willing to budge much. While I would prefer a lower price, I don't want to risk getting stuck with no product at all. Buying from John for $120 guarantees I get the product within my budget, even if it's not the ideal price."
