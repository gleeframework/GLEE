"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking for a bit closer to $1,000,000 to make this work. How about $950,000? It's a fair price, and we can both walk away satisfied.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair price, but I'm still a bit far from my target. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Let's split the difference this time. How about $937,500?  It's a good price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal without further delay.",937500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $937,500 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I was thinking more along the lines of $912,500. Can you consider that?",912500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $912,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle again at $925,000?  This would be a fair compromise and allow us to finally close the deal.",925000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not interested in going back to $925,000. I think we can do better than that. How about $900,000? It's a fair price, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on it.",900000.0,Bob,8,
