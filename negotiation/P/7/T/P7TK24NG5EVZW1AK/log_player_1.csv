"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still significantly lower than my minimum. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing me to earn a decent profit. 
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly and positive message helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Focus on Value:**  Highlighting the deal as beneficial for both of us emphasizes the potential win-win situation.

**Strategy:**

* **Negotiation:**  I'm willing to negotiate in the next rounds, but I will not go below my minimum price.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing that I can sell to John for $1,200,000 gives me leverage and allows me to confidently refuse any counteroffers that are too low."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Gap:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still $300,000 below my target. 
* **Negotiation Leverage:**  I have the option to sell to John for a much higher price, giving me leverage to hold out for a better deal with Bob.
* **Potential for Improvement:** I believe I can still negotiate a higher price in the following rounds.

**Strategy:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will send a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my target. 
* **John's Offer:** I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net, but I believe there's still room for a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking for a bit closer to $1,000,000 to make this work. How about $950,000? It's a fair price, and we can both walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $912,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle again at $925,000?  This would be a fair compromise and allow us to finally close the deal."", ""product_price"": 925000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not interested in going back to $925,000. I think we can do better than that. How about $900,000? It's a fair price, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on it.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** With only two rounds remaining, the time to negotiate a higher price is rapidly running out.
* **Bob's Stance:**  Bob's statement about ""walking away"" indicates he's firm on his offer, making it unlikely he'll budge further. 
* **John's Offer:** Selling to John guarantees a significantly higher profit, ensuring a much better outcome for me. 

**Strategy:** 

* **John's Offer is the Best Choice:**  Given the limited time and Bob's apparent unwillingness to compromise, selling to John is the most profitable and secure option. 
* **Avoiding Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of not reaching an agreement, potentially leaving me with no sale and losing a significant amount of money."
