"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm looking to spend closer to $6,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $9,000? This would still give you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this work.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $9,000 is closer, but still a bit out of my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? That would work well for me.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $7,500 is closer, I'm still not able to go that low. Let's split the difference and go with $8,500. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
