# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product at a special price. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset that will bring you significant benefits. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still above my ideal target of saving as much money as possible. I'm going to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $900,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I can do $1,100,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer, but still a fair price for this exceptional product. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but I'm still determined to get a better price. $1,100,000 is closer to my ideal range, but I believe I can squeeze out a bit more savings. I'll try another counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,000,000. I can do $1,050,000, which is a fair price for this exceptional product, and it's a compromise that I think you'll find reasonable. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,050,000, which is only $50,000 more than my last counteroffer.  At this point, I'm willing to accept this offer. I've made significant progress in negotiating a lower price, and  I don't want to risk losing the deal by pushing too hard.  The cost is still within my budget and significantly less than the price from John."
