"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product.  Its value is significant, and I believe it can generate substantial returns for you.

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your desired profit margin.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true worth and potential. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,350,000. This reflects the product's value while acknowledging your interest.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, while I see the value in the product, $1,350,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This price reflects a fair compromise and allows us both to secure a beneficial deal.  Let's close this agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
