Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your desired profit margin.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
