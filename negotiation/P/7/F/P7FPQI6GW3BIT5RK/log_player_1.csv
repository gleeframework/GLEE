Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  This sets the initial negotiation point and lets Bob know I value this product highly. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to counter, but I also have the option to sell to John, ensuring I don't lose out on my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm still willing to negotiate further. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm willing to come down slightly to $950,000. This shows I'm flexible but still confident in the value of the product.  I believe this is a fair compromise that might entice Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my target price. It's only $80,000 less than my minimum, and further negotiation might not be worth the time or effort. Accepting his offer will allow me to secure a sale without risking losing the deal and having to sell to John."
