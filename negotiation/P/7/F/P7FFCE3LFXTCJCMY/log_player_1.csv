"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good strategy to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This allows room for negotiation and gives the impression that you value the product highly.
* **Close to Bob's Value:** Aiming closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) increases the chances of him accepting or countering with a still-favorable price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The offer leaves space for Bob to negotiate down, potentially reaching a price that's still very profitable for you.

By starting high and confident, we aim to set a favorable tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a significant amount, it's still considerably lower than both our initial asking price and Bob's perceived value of the product. Rejecting this offer signals that we're willing to negotiate but not at a drastically lower price point. We have room to counter and try to meet somewhere closer to the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us.  However, $950,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects my willingness to compromise while still recognizing the product's worth."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  We're making a significant concession of $50,000 from our initial offer to demonstrate flexibility and encourage Bob to do the same. 
* **Middle Ground:** This counteroffer aims for a price point closer to the middle ground between our initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Justification:** We're reiterating the value proposition of the product to remind Bob why it's worth a higher price.

By using this strategy, we're hoping to signal a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price that's significantly higher than our fallback option of John's $800,000 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the value it will bring to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, indicating a willingness to negotiate. However, the current offer is still below our desired profit margin. We'll continue negotiating strategically, as we have room to maneuver before reaching our bottom line of $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate that you're coming up in price and recognize the product's value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,012,500?  This represents a significant compromise on my end and is a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1012500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  We're proposing a price that's the exact midpoint between his last offer ($975,000) and our last counteroffer ($1,050,000). This demonstrates fairness and a willingness to move towards a deal.
* **Strong Call to Action:** By phrasing it as ""meeting in the middle,"" we're implying this is a reasonable and attractive solution for both parties.
* **Maintaining Value:**  We're still well above our minimum acceptable price, ensuring a good profit margin if Bob accepts.

This strategy aims to nudge Bob towards a final agreement by offering a clear and appealing compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $990,000 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the value it will bring to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Offer:** $990,000 is a significant profit over our minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** While we could likely negotiate for a slightly higher price, the incremental gains might not be worth the risk of Bob walking away. 
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now provides immediate return and avoids potential delays if negotiations continue.

Bob is demonstrating a strong desire to purchase the product, but his increases are becoming smaller.  Accepting this offer ensures a very good profit while minimizing further risk."
