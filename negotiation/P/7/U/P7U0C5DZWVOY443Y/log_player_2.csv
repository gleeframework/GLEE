"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. There's a good chance we can negotiate a lower price.  We have plenty of room to go down before hitting John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We want to give ourselves room to negotiate upwards.  Starting significantly lower than Alice's offer gives us that space.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is friendly but clearly states that the initial price is too high.
* **Strategic Positioning:** $90 is a significant jump down from $120, but it's still a reasonable profit for Alice if her value is truly $80. This leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I value your interest, $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $105? That's still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room to Negotiate:**  While $105 is better, it's still above our ideal price range.  Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, so we have leverage.
* **Splitting the Difference Tactic:** Alice using this tactic suggests she might be getting closer to her lowest acceptable price. By rejecting this offer, we signal that we're also serious about getting a good deal. 
* **John's Price as Leverage:**  We're still far enough away from John's $150 price that we can afford to push a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand where you're coming from, Alice.  How about we settle on $98?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 98
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're showing Alice we're willing to move, but not by much. The small increase keeps the pressure on her.
* **Seeking Compromise:** The language emphasizes finding a solution that works for both of us, maintaining a positive tone.
* **Target Price in Sight:**  $98 is a price we're happy with. It gives us a good deal while still likely being profitable for Alice."
