"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $1,000,000.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  Let's try to find a middle ground that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to $1,000,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",920000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $920,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $940,000?  This would be a good compromise and allow us to close the deal. ",940000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we're getting closer, but $910,000 still doesn't quite work for me. To make this happen, I'm willing to drop my price to $930,000.  It's a fair compromise, and it would allow us to finalize this deal. What do you say?",930000.0,Alice,7,
