"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm opening with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000), but still lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). This allows for negotiation room.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing the ""deal"" aspect, suggesting a win-win scenario.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm inviting Bob to respond and engage in a dialogue.

This strategy sets the stage for a potential negotiation, leaving room to adjust the price based on Bob's response and the number of rounds remaining."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price:**  While it's closer to my minimum, it's still below my floor of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation room:** I have several rounds left, and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Potential for a higher counteroffer:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer that might be more appealing to him.

This decision maintains the potential for a better outcome while keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $1,000,000.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  Let's try to find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offering with a compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my previous offer but still staying above Bob's initial counteroffer. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasis on finding common ground:** I'm using language that suggests a collaborative approach, aiming to find a solution that benefits both of us. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm reiterating my desire to ""find a middle ground,"" which sounds more positive than simply rejecting his offer outright.

This strategy aims to:

* **Keep the negotiation moving forward:**  It avoids a stalemate and keeps the conversation open.
* **Signal my commitment:** It shows that I am genuinely interested in reaching a deal with Bob.
* **Maintain a slight advantage:**  I'm still above Bob's offer, creating room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to $1,000,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** Even though it's closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Multiple rounds remaining:** I have six rounds left, and I believe there's still potential to reach a better price.
* **Risk of settling too low:** If I accept now, I might regret it later, especially considering John's offer of $1,200,000.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue to negotiate and potentially reach a higher price. This strategy allows me to explore the possibility of a more favorable deal without rushing into a decision that might be less profitable."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $920,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $940,000?  This would be a good compromise and allow us to close the deal. "", ""product_price"": 940000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise and flexibility:** I'm proposing a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still slightly above his last offer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise but also emphasizes that I have a minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlighting the potential for closure:** I'm using language like ""good compromise"" and ""close the deal"" to incentivize Bob to accept.
* **Staying within a reasonable range:**  I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my desired outcome but still leaves room for negotiation if needed.

This approach aims to:

* **Keep the negotiation moving forward:**  By offering a compromise, I'm increasing the chances of Bob accepting and avoiding a stalemate.
* **Signal my commitment to a deal:** I'm showing that I'm serious about selling the product and willing to make concessions.
* **Maintain a slight advantage:** I'm still proposing a price that's higher than Bob's last offer, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

* **Multiple rounds remaining:** I have four rounds left, which gives me time to keep negotiating for a better price. 
* **Potential to reach a higher price:**  I believe there is still a chance to get Bob closer to my desired price.
* **John's offer is a strong backup:** If negotiations fail, I have a guaranteed $1,200,000 from John.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer, but $910,000 still doesn't quite work for me. To make this happen, I'm willing to drop my price to $930,000.  It's a fair compromise, and it would allow us to finalize this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 930000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's exactly in the middle between my previous offer ($940,000) and Bob's current offer ($910,000). This shows a clear willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing finality:**  I'm using phrases like ""finalize this deal"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Maintaining a slight advantage:**  While this is a significant concession, I'm still offering a price higher than Bob's last offer, giving me some leverage.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Keep the negotiation moving forward:**  It avoids a stalemate and keeps the conversation open for a potential deal.
* **Signal my commitment:** It shows that I'm genuinely interested in reaching a deal with Bob, but I also have a strong backup offer from John. 
* **Increase pressure for acceptance:**  By highlighting the potential for finalizing the deal, I'm hoping to incentivize Bob to accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to drop the price, but $930,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Time is running out:**  With only two rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob is high. 
* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $900,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **John's offer is a guaranteed outcome:**  Selling to John ensures a profit of $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than any potential deal with Bob.

It's better to secure the guaranteed profit from John than to risk further negotiation with Bob, where there is a chance of ending up with a lower price or no deal at all."
