,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $85? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95.  This price is still fair considering the value of the product. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down to $95, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $90. Would you be open to that?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $90.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $92.50.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.  Let's make this happen!",92.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $92.50. I'm willing to go up to $88, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",88.0,Bob,6,
