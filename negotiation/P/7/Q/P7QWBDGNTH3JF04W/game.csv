"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only justify spending around $10,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I was hoping for.  Could you do $17,000? It's really a fantastic product and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand it's a great product, but $17,000 is still above my budget.  How about $12,000? I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing you're serious about this product, which is great!  I can meet you halfway between our last offers.  How about $14,500?  That's my final offer.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $14,500 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch. I could potentially do $13,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",13000.0,Bob,6,
