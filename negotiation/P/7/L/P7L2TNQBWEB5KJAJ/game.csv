"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a little high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $650,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit lower, but that price is still a little too rich for my budget. How about we settle on $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit, and $750,000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll meet you at $875,000. I believe this is a fair price that balances our interests and gets us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",875000.0,Alice,5,
