Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's value but below your minimum.** This gives Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's a clear and concise message.** This makes it easy for Bob to understand your offer.
* **It leaves the door open for further negotiation.** This allows you to adjust the price based on Bob's response. 

By offering a price above Bob's value, you increase the likelihood that he will accept. You are also leaving yourself room to negotiate if he makes a counteroffer.  Remember, you can always choose to sell to John for $120 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a deal we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $95 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $92. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $92 is still below my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum value of $120. I'm going to accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $92. This is a good outcome considering I can always sell to John for $120."
