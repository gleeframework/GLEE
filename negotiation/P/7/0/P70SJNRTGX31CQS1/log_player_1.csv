Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

Here's why I chose this price:

* **My minimum:** I need at least $800,000 to make this worthwhile.
* **Bob's maximum:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so he's willing to pay up to that.
* **Negotiation space:**  This offer leaves $200,000 for negotiation, which allows for a win-win scenario.  

By offering $1,000,000, I'm maximizing my potential earnings while still leaving room for Bob to feel he's getting a good deal."
