Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on this product. Given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I'm willing to pay. My counteroffer is $1400000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $1,400,000 is still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth, and I have 8 more rounds to see if we can reach a better price."
