Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. This represents a fair price for both of us, and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
