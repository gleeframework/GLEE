Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value, and I'm confident it will be a great asset to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $10,000 is higher than the $8,000 Bob is willing to pay, giving him room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** $10,000 is still higher than your minimum of $12,000, giving you a good starting point for a negotiation.
* **It's a reasonable offer:** A $2,000 difference is a fair starting point for negotiations.

This offer gives Bob the opportunity to negotiate while ensuring you still have the option of selling to John for your minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would you consider selling the product for $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still do better.  Bob has shown willingness to negotiate, so I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit above that price point.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,750? It's a fair price that reflects the product's value, and it allows us both to get a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand your position, but I'm still looking to stay within my budget. Could we possibly meet at $9,600? This would allow me to acquire the product without exceeding my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,600 is still below my ideal price, it's a small difference from my previous offer.  Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of Bob walking away or me losing time and ultimately selling to John for $12,000 is real. 

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a profit, even if it's not the maximum I could have gotten.  It's a calculated decision based on the likelihood of a better outcome and the potential costs of continued negotiation."
