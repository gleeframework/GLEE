Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic deal on this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you, and I'm willing to let it go for $19,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing your limits:** You have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 to John, so you shouldn't offer the product to Bob for less than that.
* **Starting high:**  It's always better to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Gauging interest:** Bob's perceived value is $10,000. By offering it at $19,000, you're aiming to understand how much he's willing to pay above his perceived value. If he flat-out rejects this offer, you can gauge if further negotiation is worthwhile or if it's better to go with John."
