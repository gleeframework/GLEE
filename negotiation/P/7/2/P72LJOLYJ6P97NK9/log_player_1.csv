Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,800,000 is far above my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $1,300,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is significantly below its true value. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. This offer reflects my desire to strike a deal while ensuring a fair return on this valuable product."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,650,000 is still outside my price range.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,300,000.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob seems firmly rooted at $1,300,000. It's time to signal that walking away is a real possibility to see if we can nudge him higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I've tried to be flexible, but your offer doesn't reflect the value this product brings. I have other interested parties.  I'm willing to consider $1,550,000 â€“ but this is my final offer."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I understand your position, I'm still not comfortable with $1,550,000.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, but I won't go higher. This is a fair offer considering the value it holds for me, and it's the most I can afford. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has finally moved significantly off his initial offer.  While $1,400,000 is less than our desired target, it's a reasonable compromise considering:

* **Time:** We're past the halfway point in the negotiation, and further haggling might be unproductive.
* **Risk:** There's no guarantee Bob will go any higher, and walking away might mean settling for John's offer.

Accepting $1,400,000 secures a significant profit and avoids the risk of protracted negotiations or losing the deal altogether."
