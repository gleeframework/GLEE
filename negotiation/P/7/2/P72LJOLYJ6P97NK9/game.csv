"Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you this incredible product. I believe it holds tremendous value, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a price of $1,800,000. This is a strong starting point, reflecting the true worth of this opportunity.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,800,000 is far above my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $1,300,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is significantly below its true value. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. This offer reflects my desire to strike a deal while ensuring a fair return on this valuable product.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,650,000 is still outside my price range.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,300,000.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I've tried to be flexible, but your offer doesn't reflect the value this product brings. I have other interested parties.  I'm willing to consider $1,550,000 â€“ but this is my final offer.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I understand your position, I'm still not comfortable with $1,550,000.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, but I won't go higher. This is a fair offer considering the value it holds for me, and it's the most I can afford.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
