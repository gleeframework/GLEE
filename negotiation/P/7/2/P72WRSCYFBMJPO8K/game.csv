"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. I'm confident this is a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,100,000? This takes into account the product's worth while still offering you a competitive price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,100,000 is still beyond my price point.  I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $950,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us and allow us to finalize the transaction.",950000.0,Bob,4,
