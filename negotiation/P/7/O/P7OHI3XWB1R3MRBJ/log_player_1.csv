"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110. It's a good starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is a decent price, I'm aiming for a higher profit. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm lowering my price to $105. This is still a good profit for me, and I'm hoping Bob will find it more appealing than his last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would ideally prefer to sell for a higher price, Bob's offer of $100 is a good deal. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price and leaves room for profit. It's also likely that further negotiation will not yield a significantly better outcome."
