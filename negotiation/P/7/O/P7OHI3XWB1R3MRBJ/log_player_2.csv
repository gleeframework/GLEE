"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further since you value the product at $120 and she's willing to sell for $80.  You can try to get a better price before buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This counteroffer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but it's still above her minimum acceptable price. This will show Alice that you're serious about negotiating and hopefully encourage her to meet you halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is still offering a price above what you're willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate further and see if you can reach a compromise."
