"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $10,000 for it. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in between these prices?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is already a very competitive price for this product. I could potentially come down to $11,000, but that's my absolute limit.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, I am still unable to go above $10,000 for the product. Could we possibly meet at $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't go as low as $9,500.  I know this product is worth at least $10,000 to you, so how about we split the difference and settle at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,5,
