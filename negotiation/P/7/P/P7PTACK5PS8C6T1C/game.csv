"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $8,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident you'll find this offer attractive.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $12,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $8,000 at this time.  It's my maximum, but I believe it's a fair price given the value to me.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value it holds for you.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $10,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking to my original offer of $8,000.  It's my absolute maximum, but I believe it's a fair price considering the value it holds for me.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $9,500. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price. I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value the product holds for you, and I'm willing to make a concession to get the deal done.",9500.0,Alice,5,
