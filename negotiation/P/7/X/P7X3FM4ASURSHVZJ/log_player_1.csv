{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be interested in. It's worth at least $120 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  While I think the product is great, $100 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  Would you be open to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
