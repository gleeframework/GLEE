"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for $1,200,000.  It's a fair price, considering its value to you. I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial transaction. Let me know your decision! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You are trying to save as much money as possible. Since Alice's offer is exactly your maximum price, there's no benefit to accepting.  You can get the product from John for the same price, so rejecting Alice's offer gives you the option to potentially negotiate with her or find a better deal elsewhere."
