"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this fantastic product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the enthusiasm. However, $120 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $105 is a bit tight for you, Bob. However, I really want to make a deal happen. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $115. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a little too high for me. How about we split the difference and I pay $110? I really want this product and I think this price is fair for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I like your thinking, Bob! Splitting the difference was a great idea. However, I'm still a bit attached to the product and I think it's worth a bit more. I'm willing to meet you at $112.50. What do you think?",112.5,Alice,5,
