"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you in the long run. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. Can we meet in the middle?",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about we settle on $1,350,000? This still leaves you with a profit margin, and it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
