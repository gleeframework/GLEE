Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with an offer of $1,700,000. This is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but it gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambition:**  I want to maximize my profit, and $1,700,000 is a good starting point.
* **Negotiation Room:**  This leaves space for negotiation, allowing me to potentially reach a price closer to my desired $1,500,000 minimum.
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing that John is willing to pay $1,500,000 gives me confidence in my bargaining position. If Bob rejects the offer, I can either make a counteroffer or walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to risk further negotiation with Bob, as I have a guaranteed backup option with John. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Acceptable Price:**  My goal is to earn at least $1,500,000. Bob's offer falls short.
* **Negotiation Advantage:** I have a clear backup option with John, which gives me the flexibility to push for a higher price during the negotiation.
* **Potential for Compromise:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I open the door for further discussion and potential compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product for $1,500,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. I believe this is a fair offer considering Bob's initial offer of $1,200,000 and the fact that I have a guaranteed buyer in John for this price. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimizing Loss:** This offer is the lowest I'm willing to go while still meeting my minimum earnings requirement. 
* **Negotiation Leverage:** My previous rejection of Bob's offer demonstrates my resolve, and the offer of $1,500,000 is a reasonable compromise.
* **Potential for Success:** Bob may be willing to accept this offer, as it's still lower than my initial offer of $1,700,000 and above his own initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $1,400,000. While this is still below my ideal price of $1,500,000, it's a good compromise.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** This price is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee I'll get a better price, and I might end up selling to John for the same amount. 
* **Time Efficiency:**  Accepting this offer allows me to close the deal quickly and avoid further negotiations."
