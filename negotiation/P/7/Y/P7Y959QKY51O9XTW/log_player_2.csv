**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000. I want to see if I can negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is your best offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the value it could bring to you.
