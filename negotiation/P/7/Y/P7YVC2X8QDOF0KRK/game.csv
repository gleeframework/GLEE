"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be comfortable paying $9,000. Let me know if that works for you.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $9,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $11,000 to make this deal work.  This still leaves room for both of us to be happy.  Let me know if that sounds better.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $11,000, but I'm still a bit over my budget. I'm confident we can find a middle ground.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  Let's see if we can make this work.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your willingness to come up to $10,000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,500.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to make a reasonable profit while ensuring you get a great deal.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,5,
