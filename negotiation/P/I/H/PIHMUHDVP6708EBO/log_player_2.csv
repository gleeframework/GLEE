Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to reach a compromise, but I'm still not willing to go below $925,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers and offer the product to you for $912,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $912,500 is within my budget and a reasonable compromise. While I would love to get it lower, the risk of losing this opportunity and having to buy from John at a higher price is too great. Accepting this offer allows me to secure the product while staying within my budget."
