"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You can get the product for a lower price from John. You should attempt to negotiate with Alice to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point.  It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above your maximum acceptable price. It leaves room for negotiation without immediately making Alice feel like you're trying to insult her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,380,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,380,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You should still reject Alice's offer.  While it is closer to your acceptable price, there is still room to negotiate, and you can likely get a better deal. You should make another counteroffer to see if you can get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 
This counteroffer is a reasonable compromise. It shows you're willing to negotiate but still sets a price lower than Alice's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

At this point, it makes sense to accept Alice's offer. While it's not the ideal price, it's only $50,000 more than your max price from John. Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal with Alice, and you may not be able to get a better price from John."
