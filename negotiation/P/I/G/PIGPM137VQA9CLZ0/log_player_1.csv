Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price. While $700,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we agree on $900,000?"", ""product_price"": 900000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you moving closer to my range, Alice.  While $900,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for something lower. Would you consider $750,000? This feels like a fair compromise.

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, the gap between his offers and my minimum acceptable price is still significant. It's unlikely we'll bridge that gap quickly.  Selling to John ensures I get my minimum acceptable price without further negotiation."
