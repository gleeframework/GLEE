It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to get a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

I'm offering Alice $85 for the product. This is a fair price, as it's more than her value of $80 but still within my budget of $100."

I'm offering Alice $88. It's a small increase from my previous offer, showing I'm serious about buying, but still within my budget and hopefully a good compromise."

Alice's offer is now too close to John's price. It's not worth continuing to negotiate, as the potential savings are too small to justify the risk of getting no deal at all.  I'll buy the product from John for $100."
