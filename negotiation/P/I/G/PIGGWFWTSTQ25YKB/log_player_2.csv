"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a valuable item. I believe you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

* Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is higher than her own valuation of $1,200,000, meaning she is making a profit. 
* You can get the product from John for $1,500,000, which is still within your budget. 
* It's better to reject Alice's offer and buy from John, as this saves you $100,000."
