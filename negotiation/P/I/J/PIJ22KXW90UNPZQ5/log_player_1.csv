I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  While $8,800 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get closer to my desired price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,800 is just a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000 to make this deal happen.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000. While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, I've already spent five rounds negotiating and it's unlikely he'll go much higher.  It's better to take the guaranteed $10,000 from John."
