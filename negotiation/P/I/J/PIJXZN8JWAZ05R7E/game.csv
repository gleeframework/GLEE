"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to me, and I'm confident it would be worth the same to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,600,000. This represents a significant opportunity for both of us, as I'm sure you'll agree. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
