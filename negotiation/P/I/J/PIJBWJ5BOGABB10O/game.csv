"I'm really interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest! I understand your budget concerns, but $14,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm aiming for. Could you do $18,000? That's a significant discount from my initial ask.",18000.0,Alice,3,
