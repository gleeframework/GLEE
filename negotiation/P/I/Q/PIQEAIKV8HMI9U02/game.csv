"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value and what I've researched about similar products.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the market value, but I'm afraid $750000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's exceptional quality and the benefits it can bring, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value while also showing my willingness to negotiate.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $850000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a slightly lower offer of $775000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it if we can agree on this price.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious commitment to purchase the product. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $775000. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell it to you for $825000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring.",825000.0,Alice,5,
