"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value and importance to both of us, I propose a price of $14,500 for it. This offer is exclusive to you and is valid for the next 3 rounds. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. It's worth seeing if she's willing to go lower, especially since you have some leverage with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the exclusive discount, that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $12,000? That would be a win-win for both of us."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but within reason:** This counteroffer aims to significantly lower the price, testing Alice's willingness to negotiate.  
* **Positive framing:**  The message keeps the tone collaborative (""win-win"") despite the aggressive price reduction.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** By starting lower, we give ourselves space to meet in the middle over the next few rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. To move forward, I propose a price of $13,500 for the product. This is my best offer considering the value it holds for both of us. Please let me know if this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to our desired price range, but there's still potential for negotiation. By rejecting her offer, we signal that we're serious about a lower price without completely stalling the negotiation. We'll aim for a counter-offer around $12,500 to try and meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. How about we settle at $12,500? I think that's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 12500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Seeking a compromise:**  We're splitting the difference between her previous offer ($13,500) and our last counteroffer ($12,000). 
* **Direct and to the point:** The message keeps the negotiation moving without dwelling too much on previous offers.
* **Sense of urgency:** We're getting closer to John's offer, so time is becoming a factor."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your continued interest in the product, Bob. After careful consideration, I am willing to accept $13,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I believe it strikes a good balance between our interests. I hope you find this acceptable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good deal:** $13,000 represents a $2,000 saving compared to John's offer, and we're unlikely to get a much better deal from Alice.
* **""Final offer"" signal:**  Alice explicitly stated this is her final offer, suggesting she's unlikely to budge further.
* **Time constraint:** We're over halfway through the negotiation rounds. Pushing further risks jeopardizing the deal and potentially forcing us to buy from John at full price."
