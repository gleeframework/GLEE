Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also acknowledges that the product is worth more to Bob than to you, while giving you a substantial profit.  

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,100,000 is a good price, it's still lower than my initial offer. I want to see if I can push for a higher price. I'm confident I can get closer to my ideal price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,125,000. This is a compromise, but it still gives me a good profit and leaves room for further negotiation if Bob is willing to go higher."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still not satisfied with his offer. I want to see if I can get a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000. This is closer to Bob's offer, but still a fair amount for me.  I'm hoping that Bob will recognize the value of the product and be willing to meet me at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,085,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,085,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not sure if I can push for a higher price. I want to make sure I secure a sale, so I'm going to sell to John for $1,000,000."
