"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  Considering the value of the product, I'd be willing to go down to $1,100,000. Let's split the difference and make this work.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make it work within my means.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? It's a fair price that gives us both a good deal. Let's work together to close this deal!",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm really trying to make this work with you.  I can't go lower than $990,000. This is a final offer, and it's a price that's fair for both of us. If you're serious about this product, I think you'll agree.",990000.0,Alice,7,
