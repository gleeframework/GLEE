Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you this product at a price of $1,300,000. I believe it presents significant value to you, and this offer reflects a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000. Aiming slightly below that maximizes potential profit while leaving Bob with a perceived gain.
* **Negotiation Room:**  Starting high allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, getting you closer to your desired price.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a safety net with John at $800,000. This lets you confidently aim higher with Bob. 

**Important:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or financial limitations beyond his product valuation."
