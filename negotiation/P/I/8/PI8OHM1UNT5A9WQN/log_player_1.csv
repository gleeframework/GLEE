"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a good chunk of the value Bob sees in the product.  This is a good starting point to see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,100,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,150,000. This is a compromise, but it still gets me closer to my goal of maximizing profit.  I'm hoping Bob will see that we're both getting closer to a deal."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000}

I'm offering $1,125,000.  We're getting closer to a deal, and I'm trying to find a midpoint between our last offers.  Hopefully, this will be enough to persuade Bob."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  We're nearing the end of the rounds, but I'm not giving up.  I'll counter with a slightly higher price in the next round, hoping we can finally reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm offering $1,100,000. This is a significant compromise, but it's still a higher price than what John would pay. I'm hoping Bob realizes that we're getting close to a deal and will accept this final offer."

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is getting risky. We're running out of time, and Bob's offers are getting too low for my liking. While I'd prefer to get more, it's better to take the $800,000 from John and ensure a sale rather than risk ending up with nothing."
