"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is a good deal, there's room for negotiation. It's worth exploring if Alice is willing to come down further before committing to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! It's a great starting point. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to come down to $10,500? "", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $11,000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much as possible. While $11,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, there's still room to negotiate. It's worth exploring if Alice is willing to come down a little further before committing to either buying from Alice or John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $11,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider $10,750?  This is the absolute highest I'm willing to go at this point. "", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10,800. It's a compromise that I think we can both live with. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has already made a counteroffer of $10,750, and Alice has come up slightly to $10,800. This is a good deal for Bob, as he is saving $1,200 compared to buying from John.  There's not much room for further negotiation, and pushing for a lower price risks losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price."
