"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this fantastic product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get a better deal. $12,000 is still more than Alice's value of $8,000, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it.  However, I'm looking to spend a bit less.  Would you be willing to do $10,000?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I can see you're a savvy negotiator! I can do a bit better than that, but I need to make a profit. How about $12,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. Bob can likely get a better deal than $12,500 by making another counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice, but $12,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $11,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stubbornly stuck to her original offer of $12,000.  It seems she's unwilling to budge much further. While this is a good price, Bob can still try to get a slightly better deal. A counteroffer might convince Alice to go lower, or Bob can always choose to buy from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not quite there.  Would you consider $11,500?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about $12,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has only dropped the price by $250, which is a minimal concession.  Bob is still willing to pay less, and he should continue negotiating. While it's getting close to his upper limit, he can still try to push for a lower price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  I'm willing to go up a bit, but $12,250 is still a bit high for me.  How about $11,750?  Let's split the difference."", ""product_price"": 11750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're really close now, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a fair price for the product, and I think you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has returned to her original price of $12,000.  While that is a reasonable price, Bob has already rejected it twice.  Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly lower price. At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy from John for $15,000. This ensures that he gets the product while staying within his budget.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice could lead to a stalemate or a price closer to John's offer."
