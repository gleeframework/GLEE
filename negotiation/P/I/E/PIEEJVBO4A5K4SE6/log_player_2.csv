"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is lower than Alice's valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum. There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,250,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price as close to his maximum of $1,200,000 as possible. This counteroffer represents a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, making it appealing to her while still leaving some room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's maximum, but closer than before.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better price.  Since there are still rounds available, it's worth continuing to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,300,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to meet Alice halfway. This counteroffer is a compromise, increasing from Bob's previous offer but still lower than Alice's offer. It shows Bob is serious about negotiating, while still trying to keep the price within his target range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now just slightly above Bob's maximum. While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will become unwilling to compromise further, or the negotiation could drag on and lead to wasted time. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price, and avoids the uncertainty of continued negotiation."
