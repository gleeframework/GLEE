"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my minimum asking price and gives you a significant profit margin. What do you say?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to at least get $1,350,000. This price still gives you a good profit margin and is a significant discount from my original offer.  Let's try to make this work.
