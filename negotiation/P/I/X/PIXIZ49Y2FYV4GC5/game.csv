"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. This is a significant discount from the original price, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1500000.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1300000. This is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value to me is $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like to propose a price of $1250000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product at this price.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm thinking of $1300000 is a bit too high, but $1250000 is a bit too low. How about we meet at $1280000? This is a compromise that should work for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this price.",1280000.0,Alice,5,
