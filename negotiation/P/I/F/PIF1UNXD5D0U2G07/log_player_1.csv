This offer starts the negotiation at a high price but leaves room for negotiation. It's important to show confidence in the product's value while acknowledging that a deal needs to be made.  This strategy aims to get the best possible price while leaving room for concessions if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While $900,000 is a good offer, it's still below my target.  I'm going to reject it and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $950000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $925000. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $925,000 is closer to my target, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him a little further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm going to stick to my last offer of $950,000.

Let's close this deal now."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're confident in your price, but I'm still not convinced that $950000 is the best deal for me. I'm willing to go a bit lower, to $920000. I think that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price,  Bob's offer of $920,000 is only $30,000 away from my last offer and  is getting closer to my target price. It's important to balance maximizing profit with closing the deal.  Given we're already in round 6,  accepting Bob's offer is the best option."
