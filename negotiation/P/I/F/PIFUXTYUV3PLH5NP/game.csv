"Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay closer to $80. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.  What about $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $95 to make this deal work. It's still a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find the product very valuable. What do you say?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really looking for a price closer to $80.  Would you consider $90? I think it's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with $90.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $92.50. This would be a great deal for both of us, and I believe you'll be very happy with the product.  What do you think?",92.5,Alice,5,
