"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good deal but leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. I will reject it and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still keeping it above my minimum. Hopefully, this shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I won't accept a price that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum value, and we've already had a few rounds of negotiation.  It's likely that continuing to negotiate will just drag things out, and I might not be able to get a much better offer.  Selling to Bob for $13,000 is a reasonable outcome."
