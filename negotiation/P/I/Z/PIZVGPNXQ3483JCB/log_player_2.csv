"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,000,000. It's a fair deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  While it's less than what Bob would pay John, it's still more than the product is worth to Bob. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** Bob has 10 rounds to work with, so there's ample time to try and get a better price. 
* **It's early in the negotiation.**  Rejecting the first offer doesn't mean Bob will lose the deal. It's just the start of the bargaining process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $900,000 is closer, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While it's a step closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above the product's worth to Bob.
* **There's still room for negotiation.**  Bob has 7 rounds left and can continue to pressure Alice for a lower price.
* **Bob is in a good position.** Alice is already making concessions.  By continuing to reject, Bob can potentially force Alice to come down further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $925,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product and allows us both to make a good deal."", ""product_price"": 925000}
