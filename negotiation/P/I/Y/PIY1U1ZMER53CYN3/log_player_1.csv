Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While $750,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum valuation of $800,000.  I'll counteroffer Bob, aiming to close the gap and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
