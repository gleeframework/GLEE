"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $1,900,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. I believe this price represents a fair offer while acknowledging the product's potential benefits for you.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, $1,700,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I can go up to $1,150,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, to be frank, $1,150,000 is too far below the product's true market value.  My final offer is $1,450,000. If this doesn't work for you, I'll need to explore other opportunities.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
