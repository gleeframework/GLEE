Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can't exceed $12,000 for it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement closer to this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to ensure I get a fair value for the product."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $14,000 to make this deal worthwhile.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 14000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. I'm still not comfortable with $14,000. I would like to propose $13,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:

While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I want to maximize my profit.  I'll counter with a higher offer to see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $13,000 is still too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
