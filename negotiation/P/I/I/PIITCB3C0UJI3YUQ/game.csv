"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can't exceed $12,000 for it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement closer to this price.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $14,000 to make this deal worthwhile.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your response. I'm still not comfortable with $14,000. I would like to propose $13,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $13,000 is still too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's close this deal.",13500.0,Alice,5,
