"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth more to you and it's a fair price for me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $150 to you, and Alice is offering it for $140. You can likely get a better price. It's worth trying to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate it, I'm hoping to get the product for a bit less. I'm willing to pay $130.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $130 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135. This is still a great deal for you as it's significantly less than what the product is worth to you.  Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice has lowered her price to $135, which is a good deal for you considering the product is worth $150 to you. It's better than going with John and saves you $15."
