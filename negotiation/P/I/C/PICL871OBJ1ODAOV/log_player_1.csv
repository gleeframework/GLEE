Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It allows for potential negotiation while still ensuring a profit for Alice,  and keeping the door open to John if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than Alice's minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000).  Accepting it would result in a major loss.  Alice has a better option with John, and rejecting Bob's offer allows for further negotiation or a clean break to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a great price for a product of this value.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
