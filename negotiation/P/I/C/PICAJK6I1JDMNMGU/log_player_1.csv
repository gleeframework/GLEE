I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm happy to sell for $10,000, I think I can get a better price by negotiating further. I'm going to see if I can meet him in the middle."

We're getting close to the end of the negotiations, and while I want to close a deal with Bob, I'm starting to think that John is the safer option. I'm not sure I'll be able to get a significantly better price with Bob, and it's important for me to get at least $10,000. So, I'm going to sell the product to John."
