"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I know it's worth a lot to you, so I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $100, which is less than the $120 John is asking. 
* **You're getting a good deal:** Even though the product is worth $120 to you, you're getting it for $100, which is a significant saving."
