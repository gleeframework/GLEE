**Reasoning:** 

While Bob is moving closer to our desired price, we're still below the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. It's becoming less likely Bob will reach that threshold, and continuing the negotiation carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the deal falling through. Taking the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John is the safest and most profitable option at this point."
