"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm willing to pay no more than $900,000 for the product. I think it's a bit high, considering the value I place on it. Can you consider my counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  $900,000 is significantly less than what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value you place on the product.  Let's find a way to make this work.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not willing to go above $950,000. I think we're getting close, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you meet me in the middle and consider $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? It's a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product, and it would allow me to move forward with the deal. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
