"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we're both aware, this product is worth $1000000 to me. I'm willing to make a generous offer to you, considering its value to you is $800000. I'm offering it to you for $950000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you and the value I place on it. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and the fact that I can purchase it from John for $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, considering the product's value to me is $1000000, I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to compromise and offer you a price of $900000. This is a fair price, considering the value you place on the product and the value I place on it. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $875000. I'm getting closer to my target, and I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle. I'd love to make this deal work, but I need to be mindful of my budget.",875000.0,Bob,4,
