"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works better for both of us.  $1100000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob, but I'm afraid $950000 is still a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $1050000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you place on the product, while also ensuring I get a good return on my investment.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
