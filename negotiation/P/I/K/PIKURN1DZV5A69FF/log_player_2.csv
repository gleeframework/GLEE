Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He's already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and Alice is sticking to her price.  While it's not his ideal price, it's within his budget and he's likely to lose more time (and potentially the deal) if he keeps negotiating."
