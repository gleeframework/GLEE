# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a better price than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can likely get a better deal by counteroffering."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair price for this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.
