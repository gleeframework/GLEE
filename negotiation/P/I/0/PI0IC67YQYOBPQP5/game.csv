"Thanks for offering, Alice! That's a bit steep for me though. Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I appreciate the offer but $80 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $120?  That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",120.0,Alice,3,

"I understand it's a good product Alice, but I'm on a tight budget. Could you do $95? That's a fair compromise.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $107.50?  That's a fair price for both of us.",107.5,Alice,5,
