Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $175.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) but still within a reasonable range, considering John is willing to pay $150.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial price gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers, but still allows for a good profit. 
* **Friendly Tone:** The message is friendly and invites Bob to engage in the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for offering, Alice! That's a bit steep for me though. Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $80 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150 and even below the value Bob places on the product ($100). 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  While Bob's offer is unreasonable, there's still room for negotiation. I can make a counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $150 gives me leverage in the negotiation. I can always walk away and sell to him if Bob doesn't budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate the offer but $80 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $120?  That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing willingness to negotiate by making a counteroffer.
* **Reasonable price:** $120 is a significant compromise from my initial offer but still above my minimum and allows for some profit.
* **Appealing to value:**  I'm highlighting the value for Bob by mentioning it's a ""good deal"" for him.
* **Friendly tone:** Maintaining a friendly tone keeps the negotiation positive and encourages further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's a good product Alice, but I'm on a tight budget. Could you do $95? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While $95 is closer to my minimum, it's still below the value Bob places on the product and my desired profit margin.
* **Negotiation continues:**  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price.
* **John's offer is a strong backstop:**  I can always walk away and sell to John for $150, giving me a comfortable buffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $107.50?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 107.50} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to meet Bob halfway by offering a price that's closer to his offer while still being above my minimum.
* **Specific Offer:**  By offering a precise price, I'm showing that I'm serious about reaching a deal.
* **Focus on fairness:**  I emphasize that the offer is fair for both parties, creating a sense of mutual benefit.
* **Friendly tone:** Maintaining a positive and encouraging tone keeps the negotiation moving forward."
