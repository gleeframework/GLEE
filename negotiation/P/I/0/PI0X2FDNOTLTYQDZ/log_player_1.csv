Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $19,000. I believe this to be a fair offer considering its worth.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate and still achieve a favorable outcome.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, Alice subtly hints at its worth beyond even Bob's perceived value of $10,000. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone suggests willingness to hear Bob's perspective and potentially negotiate, making him feel more comfortable engaging in the discussion.

**Important Note:**  Alice knows she has a guaranteed sale at $15,000 with John. This knowledge gives her a strong position in the negotiation with Bob."
