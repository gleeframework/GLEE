{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is a high price, and you have room to negotiate. You're aiming for a price under $800,000, so rejecting the offer and counter-offering makes sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price. You're aiming to get a good deal, and this starts the negotiation by showing you're serious about buying but also aware of the value you're seeking."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down a bit, but it's still above your target. Rejecting the offer and counter-offering again is the best strategy at this point.  You're showing flexibility and demonstrating a willingness to negotiate, but you're also setting a clear boundary for your maximum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your target, you're still determined to try and get a lower price. It's worth continuing negotiations to see if you can reach your goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
``` 

This is your final offer. You're willing to pay Alice's asking price but are not willing to go higher. If she rejects this offer, you'll go with John's offer, as it's your maximum limit."
