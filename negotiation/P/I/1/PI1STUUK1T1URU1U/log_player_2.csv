Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than the initial offer, it's still above Bob's preferred price point. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get closer to his target price."

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While it's not his ideal price, it's still a good deal for him.  He's saving a significant amount of money compared to buying from John, and it's likely Alice won't budge further. It's better to secure the product at a slightly higher price than risk losing the deal and having to pay more to John."
