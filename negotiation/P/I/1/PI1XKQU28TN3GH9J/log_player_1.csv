{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I know you recognize its immense value, potentially even more than my own valuation.  Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  This represents a significant discount compared to your potential gain from owning it."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,400,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still keeping the price significantly above your minimum.
* **Highlight Value:**  The message emphasizes the value Bob places on the product, reminding him of the potential gain he'd be getting at this price.
* **Alternative Exists:** While not explicitly stated, Bob likely understands you have other options, adding a subtle pressure to accept."
