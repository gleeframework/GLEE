Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,300,000,  a price that reflects its true worth and potential. "", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing the backup:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 gives Alice a strong position. She doesn't *need* to sell to Bob for less than that.
* **Targeting Bob's valuation:** Since Bob values the product at $800,000, Alice aims significantly higher, starting the negotiation with room to potentially go down. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value, aiming to subtly nudge Bob's perception closer to the asking price.

This strategy attempts to maximize profit while leaving room for negotiation if Bob counters. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice is secure knowing she has John as a backup."
