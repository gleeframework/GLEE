"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product, considering its value to me.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,500,000 is a fair price, I'm still hoping for something closer to my initial offer of $1,750,000. Let's meet in the middle at $1,625,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product.",1625000.0,Alice,3,
