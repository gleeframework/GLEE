Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (your guaranteed sale to John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,500,000
* **Potential Profit Margin:** $500,000 (the difference between Bob's value and your minimum)

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that's closer to $1,500,000 without alienating Bob. Since you have a fallback option, you can afford to be a little bolder.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers you."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value.""
* **Price:** $1,350,000 leaves a good portion of the potential profit margin for you while still offering Bob a substantial discount compared to his perceived value.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator or particularly price-sensitive, you might consider lowering your initial offer slightly. 
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good long-term relationship with Bob is important, you might lean towards a more balanced offer.

**Remember:** This is just an opening offer. Bob may come back with a counter-offer, and you'll need to be prepared to negotiate further."
