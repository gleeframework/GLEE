As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is competitive, John is willing to sell the same product for $1,000,000, which is the maximum Bob is willing to pay.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best strategy for Bob."
