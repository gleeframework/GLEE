"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12000? I think that's a fair price for the product, considering its value.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $12000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $15000 to see if we can find common ground.  This still reflects the value of the product, but offers you a more reasonable price. Let me know what you think!",15000.0,Alice,3,
