Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $15,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm confident it's worth every penny. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I should aim higher with Bob to maximize potential profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) is unlikely to work. A price of $15,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a substantial profit.
* **Confidence:**  The tone of the message conveys confidence in the product's value, which can influence Bob's perception. 
 
**Important Note:** This is a starting point. Depending on Bob's response and negotiation tactics, I might adjust my offer."
