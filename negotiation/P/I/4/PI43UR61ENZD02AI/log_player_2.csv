"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I'm confident that you'll find it a worthwhile investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a no-brainer. Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000, which is significantly less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and the price John offers ($1,500,000). Accepting Alice's offer saves you the most money."
