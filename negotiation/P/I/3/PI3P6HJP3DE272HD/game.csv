"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $150 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. Would that work for you?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your offer, $60 is significantly below its value. Could you consider something closer to $110?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $110 is still a bit much for my budget.  How about $75? That's a fair bit closer to your price.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  To be honest, $75 is cutting it very close to my bottom line.  How about we split the difference and say $95? That's my final offer.",95.0,Alice,5,
