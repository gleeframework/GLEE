"Alice's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your offer, $60 is significantly below its value. Could you consider something closer to $110?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  To be honest, $75 is cutting it very close to my bottom line.  How about we split the difference and say $95? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $95.  While it's tempting to try and negotiate a bit further,  John's guaranteed price of $80 is a better deal and avoids the risk of Alice not budging further."
