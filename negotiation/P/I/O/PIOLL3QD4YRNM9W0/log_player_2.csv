"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you, which is valued at $12,000 to you based on its unique benefits and capabilities. I am offering you the opportunity to acquire this exceptional item at an exclusive price of $10,000. This is a fantastic deal considering the high value it offers. I believe this investment will significantly benefit you and help you achieve your goals more efficiently. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing further details or proceeding with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is bluffing:** She claims the product is worth $12,000 to you, but that's your maximum limit. She's likely inflating the perceived value to justify her high asking price.
* **Room for negotiation:** Alice is clearly eager to sell. Rejecting her first offer opens the door for her to propose a lower price, closer to her own valuation of $8,000.
* **John is the fallback:** While buying from John is your most expensive option, it guarantees you'll get the product. It's better to keep this as a last resort if negotiations with Alice completely fail."
