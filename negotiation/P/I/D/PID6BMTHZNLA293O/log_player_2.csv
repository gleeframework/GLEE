"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You are aiming to save as much money as possible, and $950,000 is still a significant amount above your target of $1,000,000.
* **There are more rounds to go.** It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. 
* **John's offer is your safety net.** If negotiations fail, you can always buy from John for $1,000,000."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the potential of the product, $950,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This price is still fair given its value, and it would allow us both to close a profitable deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable counteroffer:**  You're aiming for a significant price reduction, but starting with a $100,000 drop from Alice's offer makes it seem reasonable and opens room for further negotiation.
* **Highlighting mutual benefit:**  Framing the counteroffer as a ""profitable deal"" for both parties is a persuasive tactic.
* **Setting the stage for further negotiation:**  The message leaves room for Alice to respond and potentially counter your offer, keeping the negotiation alive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm motivated to sell, I believe the product's value justifies a higher price.  I could consider letting it go for $920,000.  This feels like a reasonable compromise that still reflects the significant benefits the product offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** Although it's lower than the initial price, it's still significantly higher than your target.
* **More room for negotiation:** You have several rounds left, and there's potential to bring the price down further. 
* **John's offer is a backup:** You can always buy from John if negotiations fail. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you maintain leverage and keep the negotiation going in a direction that benefits you."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $920,000.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $880,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal quickly. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 880000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise but stick to your goal:** You're moving closer to Alice's price but still staying within your budget constraints.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice is getting closer to your target, but still above it.** While $900,000 is better than previous offers, you still have some room to negotiate and potentially reach a price closer to your ideal.
* **You have several rounds remaining.** It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if you can get Alice to go lower.
* **John's offer is still your backup.** If you can't reach an agreement with Alice, you have a safe alternative.
