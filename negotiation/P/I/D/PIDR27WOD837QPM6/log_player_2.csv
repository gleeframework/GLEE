You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price. Since Alice's initial offer is significantly lower than your maximum, it's worth exploring if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Starting with a counteroffer that's 25% lower than Alice's initial price is a good starting point. It shows you're serious about negotiating but leaves room for compromise.  We'll see how Alice responds and adjust our strategy from there."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's counteroffer is closer to our initial offer, but we still have room to negotiate further.  We'll make another counteroffer to see if we can get closer to our desired price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is getting close to our desired price, and we've already had several rounds of negotiation. Accepting at this point means saving $650,000 compared to buying from John. It's a good deal, and we're not likely to get much lower."
