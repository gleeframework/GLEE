"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm going to need to come in lower.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, but I'm not sure I can go higher than that.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,650,000?",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,650,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,400,000? This seems like a fair price for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
