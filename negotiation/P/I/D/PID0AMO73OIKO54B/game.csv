"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $8,000. Would you consider lowering the price to meet my budget?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $18,000. This is a very competitive price for what you're getting.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand the value of the product, I still feel that $8,000 would be a fair price given my budget constraints. Could you consider meeting me halfway at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  However, $10,000 is still a significant gap from what I can accept. Let's settle this at $15,000. This is my final offer, as I do have other interested buyers.",15000.0,Alice,5,
