Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,100,000. This is a good starting point because it's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and positive, emphasizing the value of the product and the potential benefits for Bob.
* **Strategy:** By offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, I'm aiming to make him feel like he's getting a good deal, while still ensuring I profit significantly. 
* **Next Steps:**  If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he doesn't meet my minimum value, I'll have the option to counter-offer or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,200,000.  I cannot accept this offer.  I will proceed to the next round and make a counter-offer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $900,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit margin for both of us. Let's try to find a solution that works for both parties."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a price of $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer but still ensures I receive a profit that meets my minimum value.
* **Message:** I'm remaining positive and emphasizing the mutual benefit of finding a solution.
* **Strategy:** By meeting Bob halfway, I'm signaling my willingness to negotiate but also maintaining a firm stance on my minimum value. 

**Next Steps:** I'm hoping Bob will accept this counteroffer. If he rejects, I'll need to assess whether to counteroffer again or sell the product to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $950,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is still below my minimum value of $1,200,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to compromise further on my minimum requirements.  Selling the product to John for $1,200,000 guarantees me the best outcome.  

**Why this decision is best:**

* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John ensures I get my desired profit, maximizing my earnings.
* **Time Efficiency:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could potentially drag out the process and risk John changing his mind or finding another product.
* **Avoiding risk:**  Bob's persistent low offers indicate a potential for further negotiations that might not be beneficial in the long run. 

By selling to John, I secure a favorable outcome and avoid the uncertainty of continued negotiation with Bob."
