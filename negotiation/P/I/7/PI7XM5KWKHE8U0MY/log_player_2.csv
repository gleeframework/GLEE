# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you at a special price of $90. This is a great deal for you, as it's well below what I would normally sell it for. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90.

(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. I can get the same product from John for $80, which is a better deal than Alice's offer of $90.
