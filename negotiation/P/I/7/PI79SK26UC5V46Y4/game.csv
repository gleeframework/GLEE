"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be happy to pay $9,500 for it. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm able to go right now. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, but I'm really at my limit. If that doesn't work, I might need to consider other options.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're at your limit, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $11,000, so I can offer it to you for $10,500. This is my final offer in this range.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still a little more than I'm able to spend right now. I'm really hoping to get this done for $10,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. Let's make it happen!",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still interested in the product, Bob, but I've already met you halfway and I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,500. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I can include a premium warranty and dedicated support for the product. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,500 with these added perks?",10500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer of the warranty and support, but I'm still focused on getting the best price on the product itself.  I'm really hoping to close this deal at $10,000. If you can meet me there, we'll finalize the deal, extras included. If not, I might need to explore other options.",10000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to budge on the price, Bob. I've already offered you a great deal with the warranty and support, and I'm not willing to give it away for $10,000. My final offer is $10,750, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not interested, I'm happy to discuss with other buyers.",10750.0,Alice,9,
