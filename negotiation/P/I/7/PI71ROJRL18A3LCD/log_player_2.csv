"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to let it go for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a decent price, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($80). There's room for negotiation to get a better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the enthusiasm.  However, $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $100 for the product, reflecting its value to me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is closer to my desired price, I still believe there's room for negotiation. Alice is willing to meet me halfway, indicating a potential for further compromise. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my ideal price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still hoping to get the product for $105. That's a fair price for both of us, and it's within my budget. Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $115. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price. Let's see if we can finally come to an agreement! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $115, which is closer to my target price of $105. It's a good deal considering I'm willing to pay up to $150. Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal, especially since Alice has indicated she's only willing to make one more concession.  At this point, I'm better off accepting the offer and getting the product for a reasonable price."
