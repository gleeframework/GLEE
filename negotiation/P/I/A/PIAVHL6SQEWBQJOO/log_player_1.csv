Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can you consider my offer?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $900,000 is still too low for me, considering my minimum value for the product is $1,500,000.  I'll try to get closer to my target price with a counteroffer."
