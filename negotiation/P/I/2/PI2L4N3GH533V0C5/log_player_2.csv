{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for better deal:** Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate and potentially get a better price from Alice.
* **Not a huge risk:**  You still have the option to buy from John if the negotiation fails, so there's no immediate pressure to accept."

{""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant reduction:**  This offer is a $20 reduction from Alice's initial price, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate.
* **Still within your budget:** You're comfortable paying up to $150, so $100 is still a reasonable price point.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer allows you to gauge Alice's flexibility and see if she's willing to come down further."

* **Minimizing loss:**  While you'd prefer a lower price, you're willing to pay a bit more to avoid the risk of buying from John for $150.
* **Time is ticking:**  You're nearing the end of your negotiation rounds, so it's time to make a decisive offer."
