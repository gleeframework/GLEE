# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a steal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

While $900,000 is better than $1,000,000, it's still above my target of $800,000. I'll try to negotiate with Alice and see if I can get a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000. It's a fair compromise considering the value of this product for you.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.
