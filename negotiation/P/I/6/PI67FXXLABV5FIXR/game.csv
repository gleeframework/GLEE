"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000 for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product, given its value to me. This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to reach an agreement quickly.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $850,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid I need to prioritize getting a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,100,000 for it. Would you be willing to consider this price?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget. I'm happy to compromise further and offer $950,000 for the product.  This would be a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to reach a fair compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $950,000 is enough for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get at least $1,050,000 for it. This is my final offer in this range, so let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. I'm still aiming for a price closer to my budget.  Let's split the difference again and see if we can agree on $975,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to both of us, and we can move forward with a deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $1,075,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle one last time.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
