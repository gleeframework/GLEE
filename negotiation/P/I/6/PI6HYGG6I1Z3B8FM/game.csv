"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, but I think that's as low as I can go. I believe the product is worth more than that to you, and I'm willing to take that risk. Let's see if we can make a deal at $950,000.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate further. However, $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm going to stick with my offer of $850,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe we can come to an agreement here.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still interested in the product, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $950,000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 2-year warranty and a comprehensive maintenance package, which will save you money in the long run. I think this is a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product with added value. I'm still at $950,000.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer and the added value you're providing. However,  I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product without the warranty and maintenance package. This is a fair compromise, and I believe we can close the deal at this price.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to remove the warranty and maintenance package, but I need to make up for the lost value. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $925,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price for both of us.",925000.0,Alice,7,
