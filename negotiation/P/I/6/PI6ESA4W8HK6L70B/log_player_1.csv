"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $17,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $14,500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low, and I'm willing to take the risk of continuing the negotiation to try and get a better price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $14,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's work together to close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $15,500.  This is a fair price that allows us both to make a good deal.  Let's finalize this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 
Bob's offer is very close to my minimum price, and I'm confident I can't get a much better deal. It's better to secure the sale now and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
