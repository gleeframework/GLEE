Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to get a good price, but I'm also willing to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the deal, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay up to $120 for the product. Please let me know if this is possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $120, I believe I can get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $120 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $130? It's still a great price for a product like this, and I think it's fair to both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my request, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose $125 as the final price for the product. This allows us to reach an agreement within my budget while ensuring you receive a reasonable compensation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm willing to accept this offer as it's the best I can get from Bob and selling to John will not make much more of a difference."
