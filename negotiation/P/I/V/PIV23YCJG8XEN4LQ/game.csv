"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll really benefit from it. With that being said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the value it brings to the table. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in your product, $1,200,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a competitive price. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm ready to pay $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in your product. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1,150,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,125,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value it brings. I think it's a fair price, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
