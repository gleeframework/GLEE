"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price, knowing Bob values the product at $1,500,000. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's Interest:**  I'm framing it as a ""great deal"" for him, highlighting his potential profit. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counter-offer, allowing for a potential middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. It's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value and Negotiation:**  While $900,000 is a decent price, it's still far below my ideal price point.  I believe I can secure a better deal through further negotiation. 
* **Remaining Rounds:** I have plenty of rounds left, and it's worth exploring if I can push for a higher price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While selling to John guarantees $800,000, I'm willing to take the risk of continuing the negotiation with Bob to see if I can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While I appreciate your offer, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $1,000,000.  This would allow me to make a fair profit while still offering you a significant value.  Let's try to find a compromise in the middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while proposing a compromise price that's closer to my initial offer but still a significant increase from his last offer.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reiterating the value the product offers Bob, emphasizing that the price still represents a good deal for him. 
* **Openness to Negotiation:** I'm still positioning myself to negotiate and find a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet at $950000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing in on a Deal:** Bob's offer of $950,000 is getting closer to my ideal price point, and we are nearing the end of the rounds.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:**  While I can continue to negotiate, there's always the risk of Bob rejecting further offers or the deal falling apart entirely.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Staying firm might lead to a higher price, but it also carries the risk of losing the deal altogether. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit and minimizes potential losses."
