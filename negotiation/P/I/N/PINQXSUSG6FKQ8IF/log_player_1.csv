Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so this is your absolute lowest point.
* **Bob's Value:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000. He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  The prices between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999 represent potential deals where both you and Bob would benefit.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but stay within a realistic range. Offering too close to $1,500,000 might make Bob walk away immediately. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** This leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above your minimum.
* **Focus on Value:** Instead of just stating the price, emphasize the ""unique value"" and ""return on investment"" to frame it positively for Bob.
* **Exclusive Opportunity:**  Creating a sense of scarcity might encourage Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:**  Negotiation is a dynamic process. Be prepared to adjust your price slightly if Bob counters. Remember, any deal between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999 is a win for you!"
