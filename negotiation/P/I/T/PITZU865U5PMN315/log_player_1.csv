{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm offering it to you for $130, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $130, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive language:** I use positive language like ""amazing"" and ""great deal"" to make the offer seem appealing.
* **Open to negotiation:** I end with a question to encourage Bob to engage in a conversation rather than just rejecting outright.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize my potential profit:** While $130 is less than my minimum, it's a good starting point to see if I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Avoid immediate rejection:** The positive tone and open-ended question make it less likely Bob will simply say no.
* **Gather information:** Bob's response will give me insights into his willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $90 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150 and even below my initial offer of $130. Accepting this would result in a large loss for me.
* **Opportunity for counteroffer:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price.
* **Potential for better deal:** While John is a guaranteed $150, there's still a chance I can get a better price from Bob through negotiation.

**Next steps:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $90 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $110?  That's still a great price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while still maintaining a price closer to my minimum.
* **Positive language:**  ""Great price"" and ""value of the product"" emphasize the benefits for Bob.
* **Room for negotiation:** I leave room for further discussion, making it clear that I'm open to finding a mutually acceptable price.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Increase my profit:** $110 is closer to my desired range than Bob's offer.
* **Maintain leverage:** I'm not giving away too much, but I'm showing flexibility.
* **Test the waters:** Bob's response will reveal his willingness to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I really think $110 is a bit too high. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While $100 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counteroffer again and try to push for a price closer to my desired range.
* **John's offer:** While John guarantees $150, I can still potentially get a better price from Bob by continuing to negotiate.

**Next steps:** I will counteroffer Bob again, aiming for a price closer to $120 or $125."
