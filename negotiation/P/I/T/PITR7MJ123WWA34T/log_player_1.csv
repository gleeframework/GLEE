Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good deal.  I know the product is worth at least $800,000 to me, and I'm hoping Bob values it even higher.  We'll see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $800,000 is my minimum, I believe the product is worth more, and I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but I'm still aiming for a good deal.  I believe the product is worth more than $800,000 to Bob, and I'm hoping to find a compromise closer to my initial asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly not willing to pay more than $750,000, and while I could try to negotiate further, it's not worth the risk. I'm going to sell to John for $800,000, which is my minimum and guarantees me a good deal."
