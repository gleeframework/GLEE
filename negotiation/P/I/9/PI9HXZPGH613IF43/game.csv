"Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to save as much as possible.  Given the value to me, I'm prepared to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  This price is fair for both of us and allows for a profitable transaction.  Let me know if you're open to this offer.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. While I understand your position, I must maintain a certain level of profitability for my business. I am unable to accept $1,250,000 for the product. However, I am willing to consider an offer closer to my original asking price. Therefore, I propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000. This still represents a significant saving for you compared to the product's value, while allowing me to achieve a satisfactory return.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your need for profitability, but $1,300,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,275,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and it allows us both to make a reasonable profit. I'm hopeful you'll reconsider my offer.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
