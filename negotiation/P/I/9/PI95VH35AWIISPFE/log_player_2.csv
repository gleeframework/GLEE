"Round 1

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

It's a great deal at $5,000, but there's no reason to believe it's Alice's absolute bottom price.  Let's see if we can get it for even less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 3000} 
```

I'm starting with a low counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  $3,000 is a significant drop from her initial price and should give us some room to maneuver."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice is moving in the right direction, but $4,000 is still too high. I'll try to push her lower with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 3500} 
```

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $3,500. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but still believe we can find a price that works for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice is still not budging much.  I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm not going to overpay.  I'll try one more counteroffer before I consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 3800} 
```

This is my final counteroffer. I'm willing to go up a bit more to $3,800, but I'm hoping Alice will realize that we're close to an agreement and meet me in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice is clearly unwilling to budge.  At this point, I'm not willing to risk going another round and potentially getting stuck with a price higher than what John is offering.  It's time to go with the sure thing and buy from John."
