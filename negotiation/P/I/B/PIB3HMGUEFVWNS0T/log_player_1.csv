"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $11,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's a bit above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Focus on value:** I emphasize the product's value to Bob, hoping to pique his interest.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I leave the door open for counteroffers, signaling flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum threshold of $10,000. While I'm open to negotiation, his initial offer is too low. I'll reject it and make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to find a price point that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This price still reflects the value of the product for you. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a lower price:** I've dropped my price to $10,500, acknowledging Bob's interest but staying above my minimum threshold.
* **Focus on value again:**  I reiterate the value of the product to Bob, hoping to emphasize why this price is fair.
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  I use a friendly and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down, but I'm still a bit far off from what I'm comfortable paying. Can you meet me at $9,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, $9,800 is still below my threshold. I'd rather hold out for a better offer, or even consider selling to John at this point.  The risk of continuing the negotiation is that Bob might become frustrated and walk away.  

I'll proceed to the next round with a counteroffer, but will be prepared to accept John's offer if the negotiation with Bob doesn't yield a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're getting closer. I'm willing to go to $10,200. This is a fair price, given the value of the product for you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small concession:** I'm making a small concession, dropping my price to $10,200. This shows flexibility while still remaining above my minimum.
* **Emphasize fairness:** I stress that $10,200 is a fair price considering the product's value for Bob. This appeals to his sense of reason.
* **Direct question:** I end with a direct question to encourage a response and move the negotiation forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Can you meet me at $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $9,500 is still below my minimum threshold. We've gone back and forth a few times, and it seems like he's not going to come up to a price I'm comfortable with.  

Rather than continue to negotiate and risk him walking away completely, it's better to secure the sale with John at $10,000. This guarantees a profit for me, and I can avoid further potential losses in this negotiation."
