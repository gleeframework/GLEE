Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000 but leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $10,000 is a good price, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price range.  I'll counter Bob's offer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still a good price for me and leaves some room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $9,500 is significantly closer to my desired price range than John's offer of $8,000.  I'm accepting Bob's offer to secure a good deal and avoid the risk of losing out on a sale altogether."
