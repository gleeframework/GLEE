"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,250,000 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to at least get $1,350,000 for the product.  This still represents a significant value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $1,300,000. I'm willing to pay up to that amount, but no more. Can you meet me in the middle?",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I hear you, but $1,300,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one, but I need to see $1,325,000.  This is a good deal for both of us, and it allows us to reach an agreement. What do you say?",1325000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,325,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",1300000.0,Bob,6,
