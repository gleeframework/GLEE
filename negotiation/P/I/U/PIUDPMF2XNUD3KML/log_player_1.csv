Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're asking for more than your minimum price of $100.
* **It's below Bob's value:** You're giving Bob some room to negotiate and still get a good deal.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:**  There's enough wiggle room to negotiate further if Bob isn't happy with the initial price. 

Let me know what Bob's response is, and we can adjust our strategy accordingly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $130 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  How about $115?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $115 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than the $130 we initially offered.  We can likely get closer to our target price by making a counteroffer.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $115 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $125? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```

Here's why this counteroffer is a good choice:

* **It's a compromise:** We're moving closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility.
* **It's still above our minimum:**  $125 is still above our minimum price of $100.
* **It leaves room for further negotiation:**  There's still some wiggle room in case Bob wants to counter again. 

Let's see if Bob will accept our compromise!"
