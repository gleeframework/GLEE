"I'm starting to think you're trying to drive a hard bargain, Bob! While I appreciate your persistence, I'm not willing to go as low as $845000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $845000 and my previous offer of $855000. I'm thinking $850000 is a fair price, considering the value the product will bring to you.

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $850000. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can meet you at $849000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",849000.0,Alice,9,,
