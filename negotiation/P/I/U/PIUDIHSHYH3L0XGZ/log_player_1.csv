{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I've assessed its value to be significant, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,000,000. This reflects a fair market value while leaving room for negotiation.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a good amount, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price of $1,000,000. I'll try to counter with a price closer to that in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I value your offer, I'm still a bit higher than $900,000.  I'm happy to meet in the middle and propose a price of $950,000. This would be a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can finalize this."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $900,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession and propose a price of $920,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $950,000, it's getting late in the negotiation and I want to ensure a sale.  $920,000 is a good price and much better than selling to John for $800,000."
