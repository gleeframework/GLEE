"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I agree the product is valuable, $950,000 is quite a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is closer to my target, it's still a bit high.  I'm prepared to offer $800,000, which is my absolute maximum.  This price allows me to make the purchase and also leaves you with a fair profit. Let's see if we can close this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
