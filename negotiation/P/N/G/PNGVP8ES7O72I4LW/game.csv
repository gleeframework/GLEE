"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the benefits it will bring to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
