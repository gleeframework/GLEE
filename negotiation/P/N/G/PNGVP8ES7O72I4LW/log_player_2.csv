"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is worth much more to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a good price, it's still above your maximum budget. You have room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal.  There's also the option of buying from John for a lower price, so rejecting Alice's offer is the most strategic move at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you valuing this product so highly. However, my budget for this product is $1,000,000.  Would you be willing to come down to that price?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the benefits it will bring to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is closer to your budget, but you can still potentially get a better deal. You're only $50,000 away from your ideal price with John, and there's a chance Alice might be willing to drop even lower to close the deal.  Rejecting her offer allows you to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm prepared to pay $1,025,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I'm confident this deal will be mutually beneficial."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $1,037,500. This is a compromise that I'm willing to make to find a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,037,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,037,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,037,500 is tempting, it's still higher than your ideal price from John.  You're only $37,500 away from John's offer, and with a few more rounds of negotiation, you might be able to get Alice closer to your desired price. Rejecting her offer allows you to continue exploring potential savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,012,500.  This would represent a significant gain for you compared to selling to John, and it's a price I'm comfortable paying."", ""product_price"": 1012500}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $1,022,500. This is as close as I'm willing to go, considering the value I place on this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,022,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,022,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,022,500 is still above your ideal price from John. You've reached a point where further negotiation might not be worth the effort, as Alice is likely to be stubborn at this point.  Buying from John guarantees the lowest price and allows you to avoid further negotiation."
