Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential return on investment for you. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 from John, it's always beneficial to explore maximizing your profit.
* **High but Reasonable:**  The offer price of $1,450,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still leaves room for negotiation. It's unlikely Bob would accept an offer close to $1,500,000. 
* **Justification:**  The message subtly emphasizes the ""unique value proposition"" to justify the high price without revealing your bottom line.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains open for discussion, allowing Bob to counter-offer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price above $1,500,000. 

**Important Considerations:**

* Bob's negotiation skills and risk appetite are unknown. There's a chance he'll reject the offer outright.
* Time sensitivity isn't factored in. If a quick sale is crucial, a slightly lower offer might be more strategic."
