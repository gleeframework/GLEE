"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value is worth no less than $12000 to me.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $15000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $13500. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $11000 is still a bit lower than my minimum price, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12500. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $12500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll make a counteroffer of $11500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",11500.0,Bob,6,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12800. This is as low as I can go without losing money. What do you think?",12800.0,Alice,7,
