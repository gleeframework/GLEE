"I'm interested in the product, but I think $110 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider my offer?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100, which is still a great deal considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $100, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. That's a fair price for both of us, and I think we can close the deal.  What do you say?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm still not comfortable with $105. I'm willing to pay $92 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering I've already made a few offers and we're getting close to the price I'm willing to pay. Can you meet me at this price?,92.0,Bob,6,
