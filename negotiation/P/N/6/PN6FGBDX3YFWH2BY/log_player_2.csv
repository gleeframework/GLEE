Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to get it for a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price, considering the value it brings to the table. Let me know if this works for you!

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000, which is closer to my budget and a good compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get it for a lower price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a bit more than $1,050,000. I'll offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is a fair price, considering the value the product brings. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is getting very close to my desired price point.  At this point, it's a good deal for me, and it's likely that further negotiation will only get us stuck in a back-and-forth loop.  I'm happy to accept this offer and secure the product."
