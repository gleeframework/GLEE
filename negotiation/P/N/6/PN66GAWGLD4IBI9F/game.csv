"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. It's a rare opportunity to acquire a unique item that I'm confident you'll find valuable. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm starting with a price of $1200000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the unique nature of this product, $1200000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it, as I believe this is a fair price considering my budget limitations. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid $800000 is below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm thinking of a price of $1000000. This is a compromise that should be more acceptable to both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
