Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000.  I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price allows us both to walk away with a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but lower than what it's worth to me. This gives me room to negotiate and still get a good deal.
* **Appealing to Bob's interests:** I emphasize the value of the product to him and highlight the potential for a mutually beneficial deal. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I don't want to be too aggressive and risk Bob immediately rejecting the offer. 
* **Staying above my minimum:** I'm staying above my minimum of $1,500,000, ensuring that even if Bob rejects my offer, I still have the option of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above my minimum:**  Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Room for counteroffer:**  I believe I can get a better price than Bob's current offer.  
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting his offer, I maintain the option to sell to John if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,100,000 is still too low for me.  How about $1,150,000? This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob halfway:**  I'm coming down from my initial offer, showing flexibility while still protecting my interests.
* **Focus on fairness:**  I emphasize a fair deal for both parties, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Maintaining a strong position:**  My counteroffer is still above Bob's offer, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary.
* **Keeping John as a backup:**  My counteroffer remains above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I have a safe exit strategy if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,150,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,075,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below my minimum:** Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiations stalled:**  While Bob is showing flexibility, his offers are still too low.  
* **Secure a better deal:**  Selling to John guarantees me a much higher price than I could potentially get from Bob.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing time and potentially getting a worse deal.

It's more profitable and efficient to sell to John, who is willing to pay my minimum price."
