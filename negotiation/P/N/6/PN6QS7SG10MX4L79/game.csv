"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth $1,000,000 to you and I'm still getting a good price. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $950,000 for it.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's try to close this deal, I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $1,025,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
