"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a good profit margin. I don't know Bob's budget, but I want to see if he's willing to negotiate. If he rejects this, I'll be ready to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I can likely do better. I'll reject Bob's offer and counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm lowering the price slightly from my initial offer, but still keeping it above my minimum. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway. If he rejects this, I might consider selling to John, but I want to see if I can secure a higher price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a higher price. I'll reject his offer and counteroffer again, aiming for something closer to $1,200,000.  I'm not desperate to sell at this point, so I have room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm getting closer to my minimum, but I still believe I can get a better deal. I'm lowering the price slightly to $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will see it as a good deal too. If he rejects, I'll start seriously considering selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is getting increasingly unwilling to meet my price. I've already lowered the price significantly, and there's a risk that he'll continue to lower his offer. With only 4 rounds remaining, I'm not confident I can get a better deal. To ensure I receive at least my minimum value, I will sell the product to John."
