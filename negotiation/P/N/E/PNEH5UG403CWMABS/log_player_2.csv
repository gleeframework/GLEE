"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$1,200,000 is still too high for Bob. It's more than halfway to Bob's maximum budget and leaves very little room for negotiation.  It's worth trying to get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount.  This counteroffer is a good starting point as it's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a bold move, but if Alice is serious about selling, she might be willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still a substantial amount. There's still potential to negotiate a better deal.  It's worth exploring further options before making a decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is gradually increasing his offer, showing Alice he's willing to negotiate. $950,000 is a compromise between Bob's previous offer and Alice's last offer, leaving a small margin for further bargaining. This counteroffer signals Bob's seriousness and willingness to close the deal without pushing Alice away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved significantly closer to Bob's desired price.  $1,050,000 is within Bob's budget and leaves a reasonable profit margin for Alice.  Accepting this offer secures the product at a good price, avoiding the risk of further negotiation and potential breakdown.  It's also a good point to stop negotiating as the rounds are limited and there's a chance Alice could be less willing to negotiate in the future."
