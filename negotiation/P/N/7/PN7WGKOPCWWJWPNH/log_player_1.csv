Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $20,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price later. 
* **Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly state why the price is $20,000, implying that it's based on the product's ""value"" gives Bob a reason to consider the offer seriously.
* **Alternative:** Mentioning that you have another buyer (John) could potentially pressure Bob, but it also risks making your offer seem less genuine.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. Your goal is to maximize profit, but you also want to avoid losing the sale to John if Bob is willing to meet you closer to your desired price."
