,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000? I think that's a fair price.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $8,500 to make this work.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,000.  That's a significant jump from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product to me.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $7,000 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $7,750? That's a fair price for both of us.",7750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer! I can see we both want to make this deal. How about $7,500? That's a firm offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,6,
