Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,300,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing your limits:**  You have a strong fallback option with John ($1,500,000), so you don't need to settle for anything less.
* **Aiming high:** Starting with a price of $1,300,000 allows room for negotiation while staying significantly above Bob's perceived value. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value"" might make Bob more amenable to a price closer to your desired range.

**Important Note:**  There's a chance Bob might reject this initial offer.  However, since you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, it's strategically sound to aim high first. You can always negotiate down if Bob shows interest but balks at the initial price."
