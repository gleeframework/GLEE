Bob's offer:

I'm going to try to get a price closer to $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate a bit further, but I'm not going to sell it for much less than that."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to get a fair price, but I'm really close to my budget limit. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10,100. If we can agree on this price, I'll commit to purchasing the product immediately.

While I would prefer to get closer to $10,200,  $10,100 is a good price that is still higher than my minimum of $8,000.  It's important to remember that Bob is a committed buyer and there's a risk of losing this deal."
