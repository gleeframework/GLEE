"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you.  While I have another buyer ready to pay $1,500,000, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. Let me know your decision.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is below her product valuation, it's still higher than what John is offering. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can leverage the offer from John and potentially negotiate an even better price or secure the product for the guaranteed $1,000,000."
