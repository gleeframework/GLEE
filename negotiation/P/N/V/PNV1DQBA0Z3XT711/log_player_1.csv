"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000. This is a bit of a gamble, as Bob might immediately reject it. However, it gives me room to negotiate down if necessary while still ensuring I make a profit.  I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and what his initial reaction is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $7,000 is better than my minimum, I'm not willing to settle just yet. Bob's low offer indicates he's trying to get a good deal, and I'm confident I can push for a higher price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm going to counter with $8,500. This is a significant increase from Bob's offer but still below my initial asking price. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not desperate for a sale.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come up a bit, and we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting lower, but I'm still not ready to give up. I'm going to counteroffer again, hoping to find a better price.  While John is a safe option, I believe I can get a better deal with Bob, even if it takes a few more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $8,000. This is my minimum price, and I'm confident I can get this much from Bob.  It's a significant increase from his last offer, and I believe it shows my determination to get a fair price.  If Bob still refuses, I might have to consider selling to John, but I'm still hopeful we can come to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offers are getting increasingly lower, and I'm starting to run out of time. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal with Bob.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $8,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's a guaranteed sale and a much safer option than risking another round with Bob."
