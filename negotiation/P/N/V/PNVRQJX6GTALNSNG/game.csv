"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $75? ",75.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $85?  That way we both get a good deal.",85.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $85 is still a little too high for me.  Let's try $80. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to purchase it.",80.0,Bob,4,
