Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum value ($80) but still leaves room for negotiation. 

I'm also using a friendly message to build rapport with Bob and create a positive atmosphere for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $75?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $75 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum value of $80. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $85?  That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm counteroffering with $85. This is still above my minimum value, but it shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise. I'm also emphasizing that this price is a ""good deal"" for both of us, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $85 is still a little too high for me.  Let's try $80. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to purchase it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum value.  There's no point in rejecting it and risking further negotiation.  Accepting his offer guarantees me my desired profit and avoids the uncertainty of potentially losing the sale."
