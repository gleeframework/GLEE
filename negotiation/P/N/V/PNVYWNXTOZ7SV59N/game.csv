"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I still believe the product's value is higher than $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $1050000.

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us. However, I'm starting to get concerned that we're getting close to the minimum value I'm willing to accept.

"I'm surprised you're back with the same offer, Bob. I've already made it clear that $950000 is below my minimum price. I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle.
