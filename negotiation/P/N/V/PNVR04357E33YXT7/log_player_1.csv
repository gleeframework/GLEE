"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a bold opening move, but I believe it's justified given the minimum value of the product to me. It's likely Bob will counteroffer, but I'm hoping to set a high initial benchmark and see how much he's willing to pay. I also have the safety net of John's offer to fall back on if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not ready to settle just yet. $1,800,000 is still below my ideal selling price. I'll counteroffer in the next round and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable figure."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm countering with $1,900,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this will show Bob I'm serious about selling the product while still maximizing my profits.  I'm also aware that the clock is ticking, and I need to be flexible without giving away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not ready to settle. I have a few more rounds to work with, and I believe I can push for a higher price.  There's a chance that Bob will eventually come closer to my asking price, and I don't want to miss out on that opportunity."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1850000}
```

I'm countering with $1,850,000.  I'm narrowing the gap, but I'm still holding firm on getting a price closer to my original asking price. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm serious about negotiating but also willing to be reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. Although it's getting closer to my desired price, we're still a considerable distance apart. I have a few more rounds to work with, and I believe I can push for a higher price. 

I'm not yet at a point where I'm willing to settle for the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, as I'm confident I can achieve a better outcome with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm countering with $1,800,000. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, but I'm hoping it will entice Bob to accept and avoid further negotiation rounds.  The clock is ticking, and I'm getting closer to the point where I'd be happy to settle with John's guaranteed offer. However, I still believe I can push for a higher price with Bob, and I'm willing to give him one more chance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, I'm running out of time and I need to make a decision. While I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price from Bob, I'm not sure I can reach an agreement with him in these final rounds. It's getting risky to keep negotiating. 

Given that I'm guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, I'm going to take the safe option and sell the product to him. It's not my ideal outcome, but it's a better choice than potentially losing the deal altogether."
