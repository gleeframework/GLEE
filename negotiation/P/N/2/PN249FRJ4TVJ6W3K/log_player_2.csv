"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. I know its value to you is significant, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. My starting price is $1,400,000.  I'm open to discussion and believe we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum budget. Therefore, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."

{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time. Given the product's value to me, I'd be happy to pay $1,100,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and allows us both to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective. However, $1,100,000 is significantly lower than the product's true value and doesn't reflect the potential benefits you'll realize. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This price is fair, considering the product's worth, and leaves room for both of us to make a profit. Let's try to find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. 
* While it's closer to his target, Bob can still try to negotiate further to save more money.
* Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
