"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. I know its value to you is significant, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. My starting price is $1,400,000.  I'm open to discussion and believe we can find a price that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time. Given the product's value to me, I'd be happy to pay $1,100,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and allows us both to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective. However, $1,100,000 is significantly lower than the product's true value and doesn't reflect the potential benefits you'll realize. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This price is fair, considering the product's worth, and leaves room for both of us to make a profit. Let's try to find common ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of this product.  While I agree it's unique, $1,250,000 is still a bit outside my budget. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This price acknowledges the product's worth while allowing me to make a reasonable investment. I hope we can find a compromise at this point.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
