"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting a valuable product at a price lower than its worth to you. If you decline this offer, I'll have no problem selling it to another buyer for $1,500,000. Let me know what you think!",1250000.0,Alice,1,
