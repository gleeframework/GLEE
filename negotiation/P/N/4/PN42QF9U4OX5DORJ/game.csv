"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $15,000 to me, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. While I do see the value in the product, my budget is capped at $8,000. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it right now.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll make a counteroffer of $10,500. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to both of us. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,500 is still out of my range.  I'm happy to split the difference with you at $9,250.  This feels like a fair compromise given where we both started. Let me know what you think.",9250.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that we're getting close to a deal, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll come down to $10,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to both of us. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
