"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $15,000 to me, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a better price than Alice's initial valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. While I do see the value in the product, my budget is capped at $8,000. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it right now.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll make a counteroffer of $10,500. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum. Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get the price down further.  He can either offer a counteroffer closer to his budget or risk buying from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,500 is still out of my range.  I'm happy to split the difference with you at $9,250.  This feels like a fair compromise given where we both started. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9250}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that we're getting close to a deal, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll come down to $10,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now at $10,000, which is still above Bob's budget. At this point, the negotiation has gone back and forth a few times, and it's likely that Alice will not come down to $8,000. To save time and avoid further haggling, Bob should accept John's offer of $8,000, which is within his budget."
