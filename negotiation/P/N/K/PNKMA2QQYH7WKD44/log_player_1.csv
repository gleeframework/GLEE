"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love! I'm offering it to you for $200. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  It's common to start negotiations with a higher price than you expect to settle for. This gives you room to negotiate down.
* **Showing enthusiasm:** A positive and engaging message helps create a good rapport with Bob.
* **Not too high:** $200 is a significant markup from your minimum, but not so high as to immediately scare Bob off."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Negotiation is possible:** Bob is clearly interested in the product and has shown a willingness to negotiate.  
* **More rounds to go:**  I still have 9 rounds to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $170. This is still a great deal for you, and it's fair for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 170}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:** $170 is a compromise, significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer.
* **Highlight the value:**  Emphasize the ""great deal"" for Bob to incentivize him.
* **Maintain a friendly tone:**  Stay positive and open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $170, but I'm still not quite there. How about $155? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $155 is only $5 above my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  I've already been through three rounds and Bob may be willing to go even lower.  
* **Limited rounds:** I have fewer rounds left to reach a deal. 
* **Opportunity cost:** If I reject, I risk Bob walking away or needing to go through more rounds to reach a similar price. 

While a slightly higher price would be ideal, accepting Bob's offer minimizes risk and secures a sale close to my desired minimum."
