,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize this deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $10,250?",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying to work with you here, but $10,250 is still not feasible for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,750, which is a fair compromise. This price allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement and finalize this deal.",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $9,750. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final concession, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",10000.0,Alice,7,
