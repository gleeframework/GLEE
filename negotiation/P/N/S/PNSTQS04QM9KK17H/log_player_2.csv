You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is a good deal, but it's still above your desired price point.  You have room to negotiate and potentially get a better price.  There's no immediate need to buy from John, as you can still save money by negotiating with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the market and our costs, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?
