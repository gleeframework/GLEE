"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the market and our costs, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
