Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its potential, I'm offering it at $20,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might be getting a deal if he counter-offers. 
* **Value Emphasis:**  Instead of focusing on Bob's potential $15,000 gain, Alice highlights the ""incredible value,"" subtly implying the profit might be even higher, justifying the price.
* **Backup Plan:** Alice knows she has a guaranteed sale at $15,000 with John, so there's less pressure to make a deal with Bob at any cost. This allows for a more confident opening offer."
