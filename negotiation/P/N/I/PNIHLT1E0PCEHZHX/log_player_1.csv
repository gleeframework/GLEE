Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you seem more flexible if you lower the price later.
* **Above Bob's Value:** While we know Bob values the product at $10,000, starting above his valuation lets us gauge his interest and potential to go higher.
* **Below John's Offer:**  While we have a guaranteed offer from John at $12,000, aiming higher with Bob allows for the possibility of maximizing profit. 

This first offer is a starting point. We'll adjust our strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be comfortable paying $10,500. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Value:** Bob's offer of $10,500 is still above his perceived value of $10,000. This suggests there might be room for him to go higher.
* **Below John's Offer:**  Accepting $10,500 would mean losing out on at least $1,500 compared to John's offer. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** By rejecting Bob's offer, we signal that we're serious about a higher price and encourage him to potentially improve his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I'm eager to find a price that works for both of us, $10,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $12,500?"", ""product_price"": 12500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This approach aims to create a sense of fairness and compromise. By suggesting a price halfway between his offer ($10,500) and our previous ask ($14,000), we show flexibility.
* **Above Guaranteed Sale:** This price point ensures we'd still earn more than John's standing offer of $12,000.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer will help us gauge Bob's willingness to move closer to our desired price range. If he's completely unwilling to budge from his initial offer, we can always fall back on John's guaranteed purchase."
