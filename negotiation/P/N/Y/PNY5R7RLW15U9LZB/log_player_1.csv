Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's lower than your minimum value:** This ensures you're still getting a good price while leaving some room for negotiation. 

If Bob rejects this offer, I can adjust my counteroffer based on his response. I'll also keep John's offer in mind, knowing I can always sell to him for $1,200,000 if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm going to reject it for now.  I believe I can get closer to my target price of $1,200,000 by continuing to negotiate with Bob.

My next counteroffer will likely be somewhere between $1,050,000 and my initial offer of $1,100,000.  I'll gauge his response and see if I can reach a mutually agreeable price.

I'm still keeping John's offer of $1,200,000 in mind, knowing I can always choose to sell to him if negotiations with Bob stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,075,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial arrangement. "", ""product_price"": 1075000}
``` 

I'm aiming to meet Bob halfway by offering a price slightly above his offer but still below my initial offer.  This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise, which could encourage Bob to accept.  

However, I'm still keeping my eye on John's offer, knowing I have a backup option if this negotiation doesn't work out."
