"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of the product,  $1,100,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it, which is a significant amount and reflects the value I see in this opportunity. I'm confident we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This offer reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $900,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can find an agreement at this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down again.  $975,000 is getting closer, but it's still outside my budget. I'm willing to go to $925,000. This is a good middle ground that allows both of us to benefit. I'm confident we can close the deal at this price.",925000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're nearing the point where we need to finalize this. I'm willing to make a final offer of $950,000. This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber and reflects the value it will bring to your business. Let's close this deal and move forward together.",950000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is a valuable product, but  $950,000 is still above what I can realistically afford. I'm willing to go to $930,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects the fair value of the product. If we can agree, we can finalize this transaction. If not, I'll have to look elsewhere.",930000.0,Bob,8,
