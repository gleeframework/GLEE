"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product at a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  You're trying to save as much money as possible, and buying from John for $800,000 is the best option if you stop negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price from Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This reflects the value of the product while also allowing for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but $1,200,000 is still above your maximum budget. You are still better off buying from John for $800,000 if you stop negotiating.  Rejecting this offer gives you a chance to get a better price from Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $1,200,000 is still beyond what I can afford.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is a significant compromise for me. This offer reflects the value to me while ensuring we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,000,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to make one final concession and offer you the product at $1,100,000. This represents a substantial compromise on my end, and I believe it's the best we can do to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm confident you'll find this price to be a great value for the product.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,100,000 is still higher than what you'd pay John, but it's a good compromise considering the value of the product.  You've already rejected two of her offers and are likely not going to get a better price if you keep negotiating.  Accepting this offer allows you to buy the product and still save $400,000 compared to buying from John."
