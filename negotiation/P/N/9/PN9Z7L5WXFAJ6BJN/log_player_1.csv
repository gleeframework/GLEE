Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if you can get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product just below your guaranteed price creates a sense of urgency and makes Bob feel like he's getting a good deal. It's highly unlikely Bob would pay more than your guaranteed price.
* **Clear Communication:** The message is straightforward and highlights the value proposition for Bob. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. If he rejects it, you still have the safety net of selling to John for your minimum desired price."
