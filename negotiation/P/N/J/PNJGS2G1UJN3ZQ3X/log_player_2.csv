Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Reason:  $160 is still too high for me. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

Reason: I'm increasing my offer again, but only to $100, which is my absolute limit. I'm hoping Alice is willing to accept this offer, as it's getting closer to her last offer. If she rejects, I'll have to seriously consider buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Reason: Alice is not budging much, and I'm running out of time.  $155 is still above my budget, and I'm concerned I'll end up paying more than I'm willing to if I keep negotiating. It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed price from John."
