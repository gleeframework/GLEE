"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go as low as $750,000. The product is truly unique and worth more than that.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $825,000.

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am still unable to meet the price of $825,000. I would like to propose a price of $775,000. I hope this is within your consideration.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While I value your offer, $775,000 is still a bit too low.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $800,000, my absolute minimum. This price reflects the product's true value and allows us to move forward. What are your thoughts?",800000.0,Alice,5,
