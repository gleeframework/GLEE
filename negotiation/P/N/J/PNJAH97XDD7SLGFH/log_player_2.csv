Alice's offer is still higher than my budget, but it's closer than her initial offer. I will try to negotiate further and see if I can get closer to my target price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $1,700,000 is cutting it very close to my minimum.  I'm willing to accept $1,775,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair compromise for both of us.

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum. I'm not willing to risk going further with negotiations.  John's offer is within my budget, so it's a better option for me."
