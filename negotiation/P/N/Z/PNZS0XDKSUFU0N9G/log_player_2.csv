"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product for $1,500,000, a fair market value that I believe reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

While Alice's offer is the ""fair market value"", there's no room for negotiation. You know John will sell it for the same price, so you lose nothing by rejecting Alice's offer in the hopes of a better deal on a subsequent attempt."
