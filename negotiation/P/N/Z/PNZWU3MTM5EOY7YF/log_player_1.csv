Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to $150 as possible, but I also need to incentivize Bob to buy.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120, so offering it above that is key.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $150 gives me leverage.

By offering the product at $145, I'm giving Bob a perceived discount while still making a significant profit. There's a good chance he'll see the value and accept the offer. If not, I can always rely on John."
