This offer gives Bob a good deal while still allowing me to make a profit. It's also a strong starting point for negotiation, leaving room for concessions if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I can try to get closer to my target by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering a slight compromise from my initial offer. It's still above Bob's offer, but shows I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still not high enough. John is guaranteed to give me my minimum acceptable price, so it's better to sell to him and avoid further negotiations."
