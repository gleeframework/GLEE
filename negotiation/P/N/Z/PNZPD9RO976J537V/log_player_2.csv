"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting a significant value for your investment, and I'll be earning a good return on my asset.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's lower than Alice's original offer, but still higher than what I'm willing to pay to John.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  $900,000 is a bit too low for me, considering the product's value.  How about we split the difference and go with $950,000?  This would still give you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I'll reject Alice's new offer because it's still too high, and I can get the product from John for $250,000 less.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make another counteroffer that's even lower than my previous one, but still higher than what I'm willing to pay to John.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to go up to $920,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value and the market price I could get it for from John."", ""product_price"": 920000}"
