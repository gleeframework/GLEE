Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $14,000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering its potential benefits."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves a small buffer for potential negotiation while still securing a significant profit above your minimum ($10,000).
* **Strong but Not Greedy:** This price point suggests you understand the product's value to Bob but aren't being overly aggressive. 

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, this strategy balances that risk with the potential for a much higher return than selling to John."
