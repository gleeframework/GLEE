Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to pay that price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum price of $150. I'm going to see if I can get closer to my target price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $120 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. $110 is still too low, and I'm confident I can get a better price, especially with John as a backup option. I'll try one more counteroffer before I consider selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to make this work, but $110 is just not enough. I'm willing to go down to $130, which is a significant reduction from my original offer.

``` 

Bob's offer is getting too low, and I'm running out of time. I'm going to sell the product to John for $150.  It's not my ideal price, but it's better than risking a lower offer from Bob or running out of rounds."
