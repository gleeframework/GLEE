Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $125 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130. It's still a good deal for you considering the product's value to you. Let me know if you're interested.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $128 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to go to $129, which is a fair compromise. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $129. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $129
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
