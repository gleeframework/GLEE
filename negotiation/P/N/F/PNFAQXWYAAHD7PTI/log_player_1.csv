{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $120 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $100. 
* **John as Backup:**  I have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John.

By offering the product at $119, I'm giving Bob a small incentive to buy it from me. It's a price that's still significantly above his valuation but offers a small saving compared to my guaranteed sale price."
