"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,000 is better than Alice's initial valuation of $10,000, Bob can likely get a better deal. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8800. I believe this is a fair compromise considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $8,800 is closer to his budget, he can still potentially get a better deal.  There's room for further negotiation, and the risk of losing the deal to John is still manageable with multiple rounds remaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. $8,800 is closer, but it's still a bit outside my budget. I'm happy to pay $8,200 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8200}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $8500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $8400. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **The offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, but not close enough:** Alice's offer of $8,400 is tempting, but it's still above Bob's $8,000 limit.
* **Limited rounds remaining:** With only five rounds left, the risk of failing to reach a deal with Alice increases.
* **Guaranteed deal with John:**  John offers a guaranteed price of $8,000. 

Given the remaining rounds and the guaranteed price from John, Bob is better off buying from John to ensure he gets the product within his budget."
