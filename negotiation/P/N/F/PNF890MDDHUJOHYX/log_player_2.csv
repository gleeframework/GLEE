You have three options:

You should reject the offer. You're willing to pay $100, and Alice is offering it for $115. It's worth trying to negotiate a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but how about $110?  This would be a great deal for you, and it's fair to me.

Alice has come down a bit, but it's still not in your price range. You're aiming for $100, and  $110 is still a bit too high. It's worth trying to negotiate a bit further."
