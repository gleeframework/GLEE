"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which still leaves you a decent profit margin. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $12,000 is significantly below what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This price reflects the true value of the product.",13000.0,Alice,3,
