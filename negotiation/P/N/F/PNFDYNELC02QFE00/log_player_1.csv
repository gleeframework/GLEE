This offer starts at a high price but leaves room for negotiation. It also acknowledges the value to Bob, which might encourage him to consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise given its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm going to counter-offer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which still leaves a significant profit for you.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
