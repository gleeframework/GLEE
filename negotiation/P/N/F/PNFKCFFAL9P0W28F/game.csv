"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I understand its worth to you is $800,000, but I'm offering it to you at a price that reflects its potential and my own investment. I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from its true value to me, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us. Consider this a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know if you're interested.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
