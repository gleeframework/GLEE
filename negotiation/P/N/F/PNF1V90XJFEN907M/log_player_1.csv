"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to negotiate a mutually beneficial deal."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not too high):**  While I know my minimum is $1,200,000 and Bob values it at $800,000, starting at $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation. It signals that the product is highly valuable while still being within a potentially acceptable range for Bob.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message focuses on the product's value and the collaborative nature of the negotiation (""mutually beneficial deal""). 
* **Leaving Room for Movement:** Using phrases like ""initially proposing"" and ""starting point"" subtly acknowledges that the price is open to discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is fantastic, that price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $650,000.  This offer represents a significant investment on my part, but I'm confident we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $650,000 is far too low. It's significantly below even his own valuation of the product. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. I am confident I can negotiate a better price, so I will reject this offer and prepare a counteroffer for Round 3."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, your offer is significantly below the product's true value. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This reflects my commitment to finding a solution, but also acknowledges the value this product brings."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:** This counteroffer lowers my asking price by $150,000, which is a substantial move designed to demonstrate flexibility. 
* **Justification:** I'm not just stating a new price, I'm reminding Bob about the product's value and positioning this concession as a sign of my commitment to reaching a deal.
* **Holding Ground:** While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to drastically drop to Bob's low offer. This price is still comfortably above my minimum and leaves room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for adjusting your price. I understand the value this product offers, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? I think that's a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a reasonable range, $750,000 is still too low. Accepting would leave a significant amount of potential profit on the table. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to see more movement from Bob's side. I will reject this offer and prepare a counteroffer for Round 5."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  How about we try $875,000?  This is a significant move on my initial offer and shows how invested I am in making this deal work for both of us."",
""product_price"": 875000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Movement:** This counteroffer splits the difference between Bob's last offer ($750,000) and my previous offer ($950,000). 
* **Highlighting Compromise:** The message emphasizes that I'm making a significant move to find a fair deal.
* **Limited Time:**  I'm aware that the rounds are counting down. Offering a price closer to the middle ground might encourage Bob to make a more significant jump in the next round.
* **John in my back pocket:** It's good to keep in mind that I can walk away and take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a price point we both find agreeable.  To be frank, $800,000 is the very highest I can go. I do believe this is a fair offer that reflects the value of the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now met his maximum valuation of the product at $800,000. While I could push for more or threaten to go with John, it's unlikely Bob will budge further. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit above my minimum price and avoids the risk of the negotiations falling apart in later rounds."
