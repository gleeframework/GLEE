"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer is close to your maximum budget, you can likely get a better price by rejecting it. You're willing to pay $120 to John, so there's room for negotiation. Alice might come back with a lower price, or you can stick with your backup plan of buying from John."
