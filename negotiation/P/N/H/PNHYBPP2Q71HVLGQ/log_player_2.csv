# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

This represents a significant discount from your asking price, and I believe it's a fair offer considering my budget."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my original price. I'm proposing $1,100,000 as a compromise. This still leaves some room for negotiation, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this product.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I need to see a price closer to $1,050,000. This would be a fair compromise, considering the value of the product and the fact that we're both trying to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
