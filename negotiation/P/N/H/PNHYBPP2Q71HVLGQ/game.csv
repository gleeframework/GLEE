"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm starting with a price of $1,300,000. Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $900,000 for the product. This represents a significant discount from your asking price, and I believe it's a fair offer considering my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my original price. I'm proposing $1,100,000 as a compromise. This still leaves some room for negotiation, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I'm confident this is a fair price, considering the value of the product and the fact that we are both looking for a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I need to see a price closer to $1,050,000. This would be a fair compromise, considering the value of the product and the fact that we're both trying to reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this offer is fair, considering the value of the product and the fact that we're both looking to finalize this deal.  I hope you'll consider it.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too low.  To keep moving forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I hope we can reach an agreement at this price.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,025,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $975,000 for the product. This is a substantial increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product and our ongoing negotiations. Let's see if we can finalize a deal at this point.",975000.0,Bob,8,
