"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $12,000 for it, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. It's a fair price considering the product's worth. If you're interested, let me know and we can discuss further details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since you're willing to pay a maximum of $12,000 for the product, and John is offering it at that price, it's the best option. Accepting Alice's offer wouldn't save you any money."
