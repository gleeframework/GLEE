# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this fantastic product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $12,000. What do you think?

# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $16,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's true value to you is $12,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $12,000. He has reached a point where Alice is unlikely to go lower than $15,000, which is still above his maximum budget.  Since John is offering the product at his desired price, it's the most logical choice."
