"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $130 for it. Can you consider my offer?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $130 is still a bit low for me. How about $135? It's a fair price considering the product's value and my investment.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your point, but $135 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $130 again, but I'm willing to throw in an extra $10 to sweeten the deal. How about we meet in the middle at $132.50?",132.5,Bob,4,
