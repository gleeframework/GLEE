"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $12000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to invest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your offer. I'm proposing a new price of $10500. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm proposing a new price of $11000. This is the lowest I can go and still make a reasonable profit. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
