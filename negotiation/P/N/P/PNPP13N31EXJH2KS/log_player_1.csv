{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly more than my minimum value of $8,000, but it also leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can adjust my price slightly based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired price point. I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise closer to $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand $9,000 is a lower price point, it's still a bit below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's still a good value for you and closer to my desired price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $10,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $9,500. Would that be workable for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, $9,500 is a good compromise. It's higher than selling to John and still leaves Bob with a good deal, as the product is worth $15,000 to him."
