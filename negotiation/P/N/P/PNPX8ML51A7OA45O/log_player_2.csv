"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I believe this is a fair price, given its value to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is still a fair price for both of us, and I hope we can come to an agreement.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now $12,000.**  This is still a better deal than buying from John for $15,000. 
* **Further negotiation might be possible**, but there's a risk Alice might reject future counteroffers and Bob could end up buying from John. 
* **Accepting the offer minimizes risk** and secures a good price within Bob's budget."
