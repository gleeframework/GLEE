"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. This represents a substantial price for me and I believe it's a fair starting point for further negotiation.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $2,300,000 represents my initial assessment, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  I believe this price point reflects the true worth of this product and its potential returns for you. ",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to offer $1,500,000. This represents a significant investment for me and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
