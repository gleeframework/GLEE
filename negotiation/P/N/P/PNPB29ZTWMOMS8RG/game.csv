"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in this product, but $1,100,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider $975,000. This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting the product's potential while acknowledging your interest.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $975,000 is still a bit high for me.  Would you be open to $800,000? That's the top end of my budget.",800000.0,Bob,4,
