Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  I'm offering a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation.
* **Potential for Compromise:** This initial offer leaves space for Bob to counter, encouraging a back-and-forth that could lead to a mutually agreeable price.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Having John as a backup buyer with a higher offer gives me leverage if negotiations with Bob stall or if he becomes too difficult."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and is even lower than his perceived value of $1,000,000. Accepting this offer would be a huge loss for me.
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it does show his willingness to negotiate.  I can use this to my advantage and try to bring him closer to a more reasonable price.
* **John's Offer is Secure:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price.  This gives me the flexibility to continue negotiations with Bob without risking a significant loss.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price that's still higher than his offer but hopefully more appealing to him, keeping the negotiations moving while protecting my own interests."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $900,000 is far below the value of this product, I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to accept $1,100,000.  This price is still below my minimum, but it reflects a genuine attempt to find a solution we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer is a significant move from my initial proposal of $1,250,000, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. It's also higher than Bob's offer, reflecting the value I place on the product.
* **Appeal to Logic:**  I've framed the counteroffer as a ""middle ground"" solution, which can be appealing to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** While I've lowered the price, it's still well above Bob's initial offer and above his perceived value, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary. I'm also not afraid to walk away and sell to John if Bob refuses to come up further.

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between finding a price that's acceptable to Bob while still protecting my own financial interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $950,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. It's also below his own perceived value of $1,000,000, suggesting he's not serious about a fair deal.
* **Negotiation Stalemate:** Despite my attempts to compromise, Bob seems unwilling to budge significantly.  Further negotiation is likely to be protracted and unproductive.
* **Guaranteed Profit with John:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price. This represents a much better outcome than accepting Bob's offer, which would result in a substantial financial loss.

By selling to John, I avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob, who appears unwilling to meet my minimum requirements. This decision ensures a profitable sale and protects my financial interests."
