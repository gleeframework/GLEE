Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a good starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'm not going to settle for it just yet. I'll try to see if I can squeeze out a bit more. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and it gives him a bit of a discount while still allowing me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a good compromise. It's higher than John's offer and still allows me to make a significant profit.  I'll accept his offer and move on."
