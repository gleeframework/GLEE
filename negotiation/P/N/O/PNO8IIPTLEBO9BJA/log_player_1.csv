Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product.  It's worth a great deal to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset.  My initial offer is $1,400,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $1,300,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I have room to negotiate further and aim for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, I'm committed to maximizing the value of this product for both of us.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This is a fair price, considering its significant value to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your effort to reach a compromise, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $1,325,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,325,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for improvement.  Bob is clearly willing to negotiate, and I'm not yet in a position where selling to John is the best option. I'll counteroffer again to see if we can bridge the gap."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  While $1,325,000 is closer to my desired price point,  I'm still hoping for a figure closer to $1,350,000 to make this truly beneficial for both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,337,500?  This feels like a fair compromise, and it allows us to move forward."", ""product_price"": 1337500}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your proposal. After evaluating the situation, I would like to suggest a price of $1,330,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,330,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,330,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,330,000 is very close to my previous counteroffer of $1,337,500. It's also significantly higher than John's offer of $1,200,000.  With only four rounds remaining, it's unlikely we'll be able to get a significantly higher price. Accepting this offer allows me to secure a good deal and move on."
