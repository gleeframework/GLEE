"Hi Alice, $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $125.  This still gives you a good price, and it's fair for me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'll offer $110, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's make a deal.",110.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's go with $115.  I think this is a good deal for both of us, and it keeps us moving forward. What do you say?",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $115 is still a bit too much for me.  I'll go up to $112, and I think that's a fair compromise. What do you think?",112.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $112 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $114. This feels like a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",114.0,Alice,7,
