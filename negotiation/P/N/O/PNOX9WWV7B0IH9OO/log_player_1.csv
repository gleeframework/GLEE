{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal and I think you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}

This offer is a starting point. It's above the minimum I'm willing to accept, but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't go below my minimum of $150.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest. I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $125 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $165.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 165}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $145? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my desired price, but it's very close to my minimum.  I'm willing to accept it and sell the product to him for $145.  It's better to get a little less than to risk losing the sale altogether."
