Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I think the product is worth less than $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm confident this product offers significant value at a higher price point. How about we meet halfway at $1,025,000? This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your offer."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, we still have room to negotiate. We're aiming for a price above $1 million, and there are several rounds left to try and reach that goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer to a deal that works for both of us.  Would you consider $1,000,000?  That's a strong offer reflecting the significant value this product brings."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We're now strategically offering a round number ($1,000,000) which can be psychologically appealing in negotiations. This keeps us above our minimum while enticing Bob to potentially close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to accepting, Alice, but I still think the product is worth less than $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for it. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is repeating his previous offer, indicating he might be getting stuck. We need to show firmness and willingness to walk away to see if he'll go higher. There's still a risk he won't budge, but with several rounds left, we can adjust our approach if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I need to be upfront.  My bottom line for this product is $985,000. This is a firm offer based on its true value. I believe it's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 985000
}
```

**Reasoning:** We're now drawing a line in the sand. By stating a ""bottom line"" and making a relatively small concession, we signal that we're serious and willing to walk away if necessary. This might be enough to encourage Bob to finalize the deal at a price point that's still very favorable for us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your bottom line, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. This is my final offer. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has now declared his final offer and is holding firm at $975,000.  While it's below our desired price, it's significantly higher than our fallback option of selling to John for $800,000.  Continuing to push risks the deal falling through entirely. Accepting this offer secures a substantial profit."
