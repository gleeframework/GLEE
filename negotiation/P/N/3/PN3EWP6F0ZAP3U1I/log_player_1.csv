"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth a lot to you! I'm happy to offer it to you for $100. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's a reasonable starting point:** $100 is a good middle ground between your minimum acceptable price ($80) and Bob's perceived value ($120).
* **It's friendly and positive:** The message establishes a good rapport with Bob. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob has room to counter without feeling like you're being unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. I'm interested but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. How about $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would love to get closer to $100, Bob's counteroffer is a good deal. It's above my minimum threshold of $80, and it's likely that further negotiation might lead to a lower price. Accepting the offer ensures a quick and reasonable profit."
