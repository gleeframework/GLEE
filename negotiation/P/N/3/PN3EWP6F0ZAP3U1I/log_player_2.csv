"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth a lot to you! I'm happy to offer it to you for $100. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a good deal, Bob can likely do better. He values the product at $120, and Alice is willing to sell it for $80. This means there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. I'm interested but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. How about $90?"", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for further negotiation.  The message is friendly and acknowledges Alice's willingness to negotiate, which can help keep the conversation positive."
