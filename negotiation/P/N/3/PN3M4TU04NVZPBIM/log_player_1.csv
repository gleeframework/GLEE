{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $99. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 99
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you should aim for a price higher than that with Bob.
* **Reasonable Markup:**  While you could start high, a price of $99 offers a good balance. It's a slight discount for Bob, making it more enticing while still netting you a significant profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this offer is firm, the slightly higher price leaves a sliver of room for Bob to counter-offer if he's very keen, potentially increasing your profit even further."
