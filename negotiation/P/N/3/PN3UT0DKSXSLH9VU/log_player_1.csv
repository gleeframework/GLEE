Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, making this your lowest acceptable price.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a potential $200,000 surplus to negotiate.
* **One Shot:** You have one chance with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you lose the chance to get more than $1,000,000.

**Strategy**

You need to balance maximizing your profit with ensuring Bob accepts. Offering a price too close to $1,200,000 risks rejection, while a price too low leaves money on the table.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll experience."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Language:** Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""confident it will exceed expectations"" add perceived value.
* **Justification:** Highlighting ""unique value proposition"" and ""significant return on investment"" subtly anchors the price to Bob's higher valuation.
* **The Price:** $1,150,000 gives Bob a $50,000 discount (enough to be enticing) while securing you an extra $150,000 over your fallback offer.

**Important Note:** Negotiation is dynamic. Observe Bob's reaction if possible. If he hesitates, there might be room for a slightly lower price. However, don't undervalue your product by dropping too low."
