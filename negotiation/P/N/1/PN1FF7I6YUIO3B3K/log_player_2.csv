Bob should choose option (3) and buy the product from John for $12,000. 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is getting closer, but not close enough:**  Alice's offer is now at Bob's maximum acceptable price. But, she's not willing to go lower. 
* **Time is running out:** This is the 9th round, and Bob only has one more chance. 
* **John's price is guaranteed:** John is a sure bet.  There's no risk of more negotiation or rejection.

Bob has made it clear he wants the product, and he's tried to get a better price. Now, he's at a point where he needs to secure the product without risking further delay or potential failure to acquire it."
