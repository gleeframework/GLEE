"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to start high, at $11,000.  This is a bold move, but it sets the stage for negotiation and gives me room to move down if necessary.  I'm confident that Bob will counter, and I'll be ready to respond in subsequent rounds.  

Remember, I have the option to sell to John for $10,000 at any point, so I have a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $9,000 is still too low for me, considering the product is worth $10,000 to John. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round, aiming to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $10,500. This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my value of $10,000. 

This puts the ball in Bob's court.  If he accepts, I've gotten a good deal. If he rejects, we can continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $9,500 is closer to my value, I'm still not satisfied.  I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate. I'm also keeping in mind that I can sell to John for $10,000, so I have a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10250}
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $10,250.  This is a further compromise, but I'm still holding firm on getting closer to my desired price.  We are now only $250 apart. I believe this is a fair compromise that will entice Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,750 is getting closer, I'm still confident I can get a better price. We're only $500 apart, and I'm willing to continue negotiating. Plus, I have the option to sell to John for $10,000, so I'm not under any pressure to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $10,000. This is my final offer.  I'm not willing to go lower than my minimum value, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. If Bob accepts, we've reached a mutually beneficial agreement. If he rejects, I'll sell to John for $10,000 and be done with the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell to John for $10,000. I've reached my limit with Bob.  While $9,500 is close, I'm not willing to go lower than my minimum value.  John's offer gives me a guaranteed $10,000, which is what I wanted all along. It's time to move on and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
