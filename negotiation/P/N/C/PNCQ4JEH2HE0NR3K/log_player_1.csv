"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I'm happy to offer it to you for $2,000,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of what's being offered and the potential it holds for your business."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob's offer of $1,500,000 matches John's standing offer, it's important to remember that the product is worth no less than $1,500,000 to Alice.  Continuing negotiations with Bob carries the risk of him lowering his offer further, or the negotiations failing altogether. Accepting John's offer guarantees Alice her minimum acceptable price."
