"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $1,200,000. This is a competitive offer, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in it.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm still confident the product's value to you is higher than your offer. Considering our previous discussion, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you at a price of $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
