Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $15000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'll accept Bob's offer.  $16,000 is a good price, and I'm running out of rounds.  There's a risk that if I reject his offer, he might walk away, and then I'd be left with only John's offer of $15,000.  I'd rather take the $16,000 now."
