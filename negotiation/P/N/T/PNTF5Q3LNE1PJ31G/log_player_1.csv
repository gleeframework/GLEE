Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy behind crafting an offer to Bob:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,500,000 because you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product holds the same value for Bob as it does for you ($1,500,000). 
* **The Unknown:** Bob's willingness to pay more than $1,500,000 is the key to maximizing your profit.

**The Offer**

Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, there's no need to go below that price.  It makes sense to start higher to gauge Bob's interest.  Here's a possible offer:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm setting the price at $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential return on investment.  Let me know your thoughts - I'm open to discussing this further."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confidence and Exclusivity:**  The message frames the offer as a valuable opportunity, potentially making Bob more amenable to a higher price.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""unique value proposition,"" you aim to move the conversation beyond just the price tag.
* **Negotiation:** The message keeps the door open for further discussion, showing flexibility while still anchoring at your desired price.

**Important Note:**  There's an element of risk involved. If Bob outright rejects $1,800,000, you might miss out on a price between $1,500,000 and $1,800,000 that he might have accepted.  However, starting high gives you the best chance to maximize your profit."
