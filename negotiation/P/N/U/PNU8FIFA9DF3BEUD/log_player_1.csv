Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above Bob's estimated value ($800,000) but below my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This allows room for Bob to counteroffer without me feeling pressured to immediately accept a lower price.
* **Maintaining John's Offer as a Safety Net:**  Having John's offer provides me with a fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000).**  While it's a higher offer than his initial estimate, it's still not a profitable deal for me.
* **I'm willing to risk further negotiation with Bob.** I'm hoping I can convince him to pay closer to my desired price or at least meet me halfway. 
* **Having John as a backup gives me the security to hold out for a better deal.** I'm not desperate to sell to Bob, so I can afford to be more assertive in my negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. Considering the value of the product and the potential it holds, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our interests. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise price that is closer to Bob's offer while still ensuring a profit for me.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and its potential to justify the price.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone, encouraging Bob to see this as a win-win situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value I'm willing to pay 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.** While it's closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiating further with Bob risks wasting time and potentially losing John's offer.**  John's offer is significantly higher than anything Bob is willing to pay, so it's more advantageous to accept his offer and avoid any further negotiation.
* **Selling to John guarantees me a substantial profit and minimizes risk.**  It's a guaranteed win compared to continuing to negotiate with Bob."
