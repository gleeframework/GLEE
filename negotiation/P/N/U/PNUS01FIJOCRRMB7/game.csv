"I have a fantastic opportunity for you, Bob. This product is a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $15,000 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm interested, but only if we can agree on a more reasonable price.  How about $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a more reasonable price, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than $12,000 to make it worth my while. How about we compromise on $13,500? It's a fair price that should work for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you moving closer to my price range, Alice.  While $13,500 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  Would you consider $11,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $12,500? It's a fair price that should work for both of us, and it's still a great deal for you.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm ready to close this deal and I'm sure you are too.  How about we split the difference and call it $11,750?  That's my final offer, let me know if you're interested.",11750.0,Bob,6,
