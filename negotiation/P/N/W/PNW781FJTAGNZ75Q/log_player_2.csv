"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $10,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not convinced that $9,500 is the best price for this product, considering its value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $10,250? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $10,250 gets you the product for a decent price compared to your alternatives and avoids the risk of the negotiation failing."
