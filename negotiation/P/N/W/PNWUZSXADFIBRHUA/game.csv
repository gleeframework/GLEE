"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I recognize your budget constraints, $1500000 is a bit lower than I can accept.  Let's bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $1650000.  This price still allows for a fair return on the value of the product.  What do you think?",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob,  I understand your perspective and appreciate the effort you're putting into finding a solution. However, $1600000 is still a bit below my minimum acceptable price. To demonstrate my willingness to reach an agreement, I'm willing to lower my price to $1625000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's close this transaction.",1625000.0,Alice,5,
