I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This gives me a good starting point and leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident in the value of my product, so I'm not afraid to ask for a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

$10,000 is far too low for me. I'm not willing to sell for that amount. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to counter with $17,500. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still a fair price considering my minimum acceptable value. It's also closer to Bob's offer, which might make him more likely to accept."

Bob has offered my minimum acceptable price. It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John for the same amount. I'll accept Bob's offer and move on."
