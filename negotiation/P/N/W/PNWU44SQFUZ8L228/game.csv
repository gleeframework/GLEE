"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. It's valued at $1500000 to me, but I'm willing to make you a deal for $1400000. This represents a significant savings for you, and it allows me to move this product quickly. Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount you're providing. However, I'm currently looking to stay within a budget of $1200000 for this purchase. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to that amount?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $1200000 is a great price, it's unfortunately a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This is a significant discount from my original offer and still leaves room for you to stay within your budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $1250000.  That's definitely closer to where I need to be.  However, I'm still a bit short of my target. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1275000? I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
