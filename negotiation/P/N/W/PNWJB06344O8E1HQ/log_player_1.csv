Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell to John for $150, there's a chance Bob will pay more than his perceived value ($80). 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $140 is a significant markup from Bob's value but might seem like a bargain compared to an unknown alternative.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The slightly high price leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price closer to $150."
