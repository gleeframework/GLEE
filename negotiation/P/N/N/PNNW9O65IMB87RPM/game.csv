"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. How about we discuss a price closer to $1,000,000? I look forward to your response.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective, $1,000,000 is significantly lower than the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, reflecting a fair compromise.  This price still allows me to recoup a significant portion of the value, while offering you a substantial discount. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $1,100,000 for the product. This offers a balance between the value you're providing and my budget constraints. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
