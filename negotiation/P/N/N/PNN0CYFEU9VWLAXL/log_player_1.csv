Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. This gives you a chance for a significant return while acknowledging the value I place on it.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal.
* **Understanding Bob's Value:**  Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, offering it at $925,000 gives him a potential profit of $75,000. This is a substantial incentive for him to accept.
* **Balancing Profit and Risk:** While aiming for the maximum profit is tempting, it's essential to consider the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. If he does, you'll have to sell to John for $800,000.  $925,000 represents a strong balance between maximizing potential profit and securing a deal. 
 
**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  If Bob counters, be prepared to negotiate further while keeping your minimum price of $800,000 in mind."
