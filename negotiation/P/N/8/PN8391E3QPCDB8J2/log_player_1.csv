"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a relatively high price of $15,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, and also shows my confidence in the product's value. It's important to remember that I have the option to sell to John for $12,000 at any point, so I'm not afraid to walk away if the price is too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum desired value of $12,000. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm offering a price of $11,000. This is closer to my minimum desired value of $12,000, but still leaves some room for negotiation if Bob is willing to go higher. I believe it's a fair compromise, but if he refuses, I'll have to consider selling to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum value, I still believe I can get more. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price.  I have 6 rounds left and can still sell to John for $12,000 if things don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer slightly to $10,000. This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to compromise, while still staying above my minimum desired value of $12,000. With only 5 rounds left, I need to find a price that Bob will accept, but I don't want to sell for too low."
