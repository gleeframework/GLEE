,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're still looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $10500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
