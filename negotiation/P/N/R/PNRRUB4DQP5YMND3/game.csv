"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,000 is far too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $12,000? It's still a great deal for you, and allows me to make a decent profit.  Let's close this deal.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price.  While $12,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to consider $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $9,500 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference and agree on $11,000.  I think this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at $10,500? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $10,500 is still a bit low for me.  How about we settle at $11,250? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident this is a price we can both agree on.",11250.0,Alice,7,
