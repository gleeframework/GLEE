Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's valued at $1,200,000 to me, but I'm willing to start at $1,100,000 to see if we can find common ground. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept,  $900,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price. I have more rounds to negotiate and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is just too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $975000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $975,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I want to receive. I have more rounds to negotiate with Bob, and I'm confident I can push for a higher price.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my goal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating.  $975,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference and try $1,012,500.  This is a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1012500}
