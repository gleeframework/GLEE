Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $14,500 leaves some space for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Secure a Significant Gain:** Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, selling at this price ensures a profit much higher than John's offer."
