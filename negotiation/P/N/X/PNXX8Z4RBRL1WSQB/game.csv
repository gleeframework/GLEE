"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1,100,000? This reflects the value of the product to you and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  I think this is a fair price considering your need to sell and my budget. Let's work towards a deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 still doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,025,000? This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away with a win.  Let's make this happen.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  If you're serious about selling, I think this is the best we can do.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
