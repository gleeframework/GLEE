"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $85 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90? This is still a great price for you, and it gives me a bit more room to work with. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product, and I appreciate that. However, $87.50 is still a bit too low for me. Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $92.50. This gives you a great price and allows me to stay within my own limits.  Let's make this deal happen.",92.5,Alice,5,
