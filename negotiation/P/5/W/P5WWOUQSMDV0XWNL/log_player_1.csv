Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 12000} 

I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. This should encourage Bob to counteroffer, allowing us to find a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial offer. This should encourage Bob to come up a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

At this point, $9,500 is close enough to my minimum price that it's worth accepting. Continuing to negotiate might risk losing Bob entirely and ending up with the lower price from John."
