"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I'm sure you'll love. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth, but I'm open to negotiating if you have a different idea in mind.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I think that's a fair price considering the market value and what I've researched. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get closer to my target price.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and consider a price of $850000. This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $850000. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I was thinking more along the lines of $780000. I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I think this price is a good compromise.",780000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $780000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and consider a price of $820000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",820000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to a deal, but I still think $820000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I was thinking more along the lines of $810000. I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I think this price is a good compromise. Can you consider this price?",810000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to budge much more. I'm willing to consider a price of $815000, but that's as low as I can go. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to compromise to get a deal done.
