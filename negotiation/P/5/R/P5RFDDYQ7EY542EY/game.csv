"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. My initial offer for the product is $1,200,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me and allows for a fair profit for both of us. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My counteroffer is $1,350,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,350,000.  I'm willing to go to $1,375,000. This is a fair compromise that gets us both closer to our goals.  What do you think?",1375000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,375,000, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My counteroffer is $1,400,000. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
