Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming to earn more than your minimum of $12,000.
* **It's not too aggressive:**  Starting too high might immediately turn Bob off. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you can lower the price slightly in subsequent counteroffers.

Keep in mind, this is just the first step in the negotiation. You'll need to be flexible and adapt your strategy based on Bob's responses.  Remember, you can always fall back on John's offer of $12,000 if the negotiation doesn't go your way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While it's tempting to accept since it's still above John's offer, it's worth exploring if you can get closer to your desired price through counteroffers.  

**Next Steps:**

You will need to send a counteroffer to Bob. Consider a price somewhere between $10,000 and $13,000, aiming to find a compromise.  

For example, you could counteroffer at $11,500 and justify it by mentioning the product's value and your willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I need to consider.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $11,500.  It's still a good price for both of us, and lets us close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Stay firm on your value:** You're not accepting a price that's significantly below your minimum.
* **Show willingness to compromise:**  You're suggesting a middle ground price to find a compromise.
* **Highlight benefits:** You're emphasizing the ""good price"" for both parties to encourage Bob to consider the offer.

This strategy aims to find a deal without having to immediately fall back on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $11,000 is very close to your minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While it's not ideal, it's a good deal considering:

* **You're likely to reach a compromise:**  Bob seems willing to negotiate and is already halfway between your last offer and his previous one.
* **Time is a factor:**  Further negotiation might take longer, and you could end up with a worse deal or have to sell to John.
* **Selling to John isn't ideal:**  While John's offer is your minimum, accepting Bob's offer would mean a higher profit.

Accepting Bob's offer allows you to close the deal quickly and secure a profit."
