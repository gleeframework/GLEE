{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to encourage acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to its true worth. I would like to propose a price of $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm going to counteroffer and try to negotiate a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but it's a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $115.  That's still a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $120. Bob is not willing to come up to my minimum acceptable price of $120, and I'm not willing to go lower. It's time to move on and secure the deal with John."
