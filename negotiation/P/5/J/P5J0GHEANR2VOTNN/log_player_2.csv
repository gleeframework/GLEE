"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $8500. I know it's worth at least that much to you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. If you're interested, let me know and we can finalize the details. Otherwise, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $8000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I'll reject the offer since the product is worth no more than $8,000 to me, and Alice is asking for $8,500. I'll look for a better deal.
