You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's best to reject the offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price.  There's always the option to buy from John if the negotiation with Alice fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts at a price significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but it's still within a reasonable range, leaving room for negotiation.  We're aiming to find a price that works for both of us."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now at your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  There's no reason to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the product.  Accepting the offer is the best choice, as buying from John would cost the same."
