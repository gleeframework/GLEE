"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. My initial offer is $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $18,000 is way above my budget of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to come down to $12,000?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $12,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is closer to my budget than Alice's initial offer, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'd rather continue negotiating to see if we can reach a more agreeable number.  I'm willing to go a little higher than my initial offer of $12,000, but I won't go all the way to $14,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $14,000 is still a little high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $13,000. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $14,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,500 is getting closer to my budget, but it's still too high. I've already made two counteroffers, and Alice has rejected them both. She's clearly not willing to come down much further. With only five rounds left, I don't want to risk wasting more time trying to negotiate a lower price. John is offering a much better deal, and I don't want to miss out on that opportunity."
