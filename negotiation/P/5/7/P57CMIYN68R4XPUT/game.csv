"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. My initial offer is $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to come down to $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $12,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $14,000 is still a little high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $13,000. Let's see if we can close this deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $14,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price.",14500.0,Alice,5,
