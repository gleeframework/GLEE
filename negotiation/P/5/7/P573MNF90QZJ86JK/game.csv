"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a very competitive price, and I think you'll find it's a great deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. Could we possibly settle on $750,000? I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I can offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a very competitive price, and I think you'll find it's a great deal.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your flexibility.  How about we split the difference and settle on $800,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",800000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $800,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not getting the value I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I can offer the product to you for $825,000. This is a very competitive price, and I think you'll find it's a great deal.",825000.0,Alice,7,
