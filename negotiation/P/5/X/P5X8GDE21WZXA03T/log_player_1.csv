"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to give myself room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:**  I want to keep the negotiation friendly and open to finding a solution.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm highlighting the potential benefits of the product for Bob, emphasizing that it's a good deal for him. 
* **Open Ended:**  The question ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to respond and begin the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your generosity, but I believe we can find a better solution for both of us. I am willing to pay $14,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum value:** While it's tempting to take $14,000, I'm determined to get at least $15,000 for this product.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  I have 8 more rounds to try and find a better price with Bob. 
* **Selling to John is a backup:**  If I can't get a better deal with Bob, I have the option of selling to John for my minimum acceptable price.

**Next Round:** I will send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to find a price point between his offer and my minimum acceptable value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I value your interest, $14,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $15,500.  This gives us both a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 15500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering a price that's closer to his offer but still above my minimum acceptable value.
* **Reinforcing Value:** I'm emphasizing that this price is still a good deal for him. 
* **Positive Language:** I'm using phrases like ""good deal"" to keep the tone friendly and encourage a positive outcome.
* **Open Question:** I'm asking a question to prompt Bob to respond and move the negotiation forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I've been considering our conversation and I would like to propose $15,000 as the price for your product. This still allows for a reasonable profit for you while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** Bob's offer of $15,000 is my minimum acceptable price. 
* **No need to risk further negotiation:**  I have reached my goal, and there's no guarantee that I can get a higher price in the remaining rounds.
* **Time is a factor:**  With only 6 rounds left, it's wise to secure the deal and avoid potentially losing the sale to another buyer or running out of time.

I'm accepting Bob's offer to ensure I sell the product at a price that meets my minimum requirements."
