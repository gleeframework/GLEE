{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:**  $110 is higher than Bob's $80 valuation, giving you room for potential profit.
* **It's below your minimum:**  $110 is still above your minimum of $120, ensuring you don't lose money.
* **It's reasonable:** This is a fairly reasonable starting point for negotiation. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum desired price of $120.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $95 is a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to go up to $105? It's still a good price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

This counteroffer attempts to:

* **Find a compromise:**  $105 is halfway between your previous offer ($110) and Bob's offer ($95).
* **Maintain a reasonable profit:**  $105 is still above your minimum of $120.
* **Show flexibility:** You are showing Bob that you are willing to negotiate, which could help reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the flexibility. However, I am still aiming to keep my expenses lower. Could we possibly agree on $100 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $100 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $102.50. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 102.5}
```

This counteroffer is:

* **A small compromise:** It's a small increase from Bob's last offer, showing a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Still profitable:** $102.50 is above your minimum of $120, ensuring you make a profit.
* **Clear and direct:** It provides a clear price point and encourages Bob to make a decision."
