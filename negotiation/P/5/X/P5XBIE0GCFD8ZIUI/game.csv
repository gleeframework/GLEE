"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $95?",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $95 is a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to go up to $105? It's still a good price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the flexibility. However, I am still aiming to keep my expenses lower. Could we possibly agree on $100 for the product?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $100 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $102.50. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",102.5,Alice,5,
