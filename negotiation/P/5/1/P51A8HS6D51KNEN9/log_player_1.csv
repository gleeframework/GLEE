Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Since Bob's offer is lower than the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'll reject his offer and proceed to the next round. I'll send a counteroffer to Bob.

I'll offer the product to Bob for $110. This is a reasonable compromise, considering the product is worth $100 to him and I want to earn a decent profit.
