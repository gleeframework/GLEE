"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $8,500? That's a significant discount from my original offer and still leaves me room to make a profit.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm getting closer to what I can afford. How about we meet in the middle at $7,250?",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $7,250 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. How about $7,750? It's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away happy.",7750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we are getting close.  I'm willing to go up a bit more. How about $7,500? That's my final offer.",7500.0,Bob,6,
