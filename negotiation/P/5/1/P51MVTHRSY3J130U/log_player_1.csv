Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is tempting, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial valuation. How about we meet in the middle at $910,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value this product holds for both of us."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $880,000, but I think that's the highest I can go. I'd like to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 
We're still a good bit away from my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to see more movement from Bob's side."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To be frank, $880,000 is cutting it quite close to my minimum, and I'd be taking a significant hit.  How about we settle this right now at $895,000?  This keeps us moving forward and ensures you get this valuable product."",
""product_price"": 895000
}
``` 

At this point, I'm putting some pressure on Bob by presenting it as our best offer while still leaving room for one more round of negotiation if he rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, which would be $885,000. I think this is a fair compromise that balances our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While I could push for a bit more, accepting at $885,000 secures a significant profit above my $800,000 minimum. It's always possible Bob would walk away if I push further, and it's better to take the sure win now."
