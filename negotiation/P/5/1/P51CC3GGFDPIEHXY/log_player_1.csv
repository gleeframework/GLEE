Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with an ambitious price of $10,000. I'm hoping to maximize my earnings, but I'm also aware that Bob might not be willing to pay that much. If he rejects, I can then gauge his interest and adjust my price accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $7,000 is better than my minimum, I'm still hoping for a higher price. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer but still above Bob's offer and closer to my desired price.  I'm hoping this will be a good compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now $8,500. This is higher than what I'd get from John, and it's getting closer to my target price. Accepting this offer seems like the best choice to maximize my earnings."
