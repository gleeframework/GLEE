"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price.  A price of $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for improvement.  Rejecting the offer allows you to attempt to get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This will test her willingness to negotiate and give us a starting point for further bargaining. I'm aiming to secure a price as close to my desired $1,000,000 as possible, but recognizing that a lower price might still be acceptable given my budget and the fact that I can always go to John for a higher price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to my desired price, but it's still above my target. I'm going to reject the offer and try to negotiate further. I believe I can push her lower with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,150,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round, but still staying below Alice's latest offer.  This shows that I'm willing to compromise, while also demonstrating that I'm not willing to simply meet her price. My goal is to find a middle ground that we both can agree on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is moving closer to my desired price, it's still higher than my target.  I'm willing to continue negotiating. I believe I can push her lower with a final counteroffer before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,200,000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer again, but staying below Alice's latest offer.  This shows Alice that I'm committed to finding a deal, but I'm also not willing to go above my budget. I believe this counteroffer is fair and reflects the value of the product to both of us.  If Alice rejects it, I'm likely to buy the product from John in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  We've reached a point where the negotiation isn't likely to result in a price lower than my maximum budget of $1,500,000.  Rather than continue negotiating and risk getting a worse deal, I'm going to purchase the product from John.  Although it's not my preferred price, it's within my budget and guarantees I get the product."
