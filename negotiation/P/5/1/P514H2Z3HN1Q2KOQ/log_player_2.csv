"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your business operations. Given its value and potential impact, I propose a price of $12,000 for the product. This price not only ensures a fair return for us but also provides you with significant savings compared to the market value of $10,000. I look forward to your positive response and the opportunity to discuss how this product can enhance your company's performance. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice is offering a ""discount"" compared to the market value, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  He can get the product from John for his target price, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best choice."
