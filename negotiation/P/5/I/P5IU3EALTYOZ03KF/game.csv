"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $1,000,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering its value.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you see the value in this product, however, $700,000 is too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $900,000, but that's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $750,000.  Let's try to find a middle ground.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but we're still quite a ways apart.  To be frank, I have another potential buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I value our discussions and believe this product would be a great fit for you.  Therefore, I'm willing to accept $875,000. This is my final offer.",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but I'm still hesitant at $875,000.  I'm willing to go up to $825,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us.",825000.0,Bob,6,
