Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $1,000,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering its value.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you see the value in this product, however, $700,000 is too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects the true worth of what I'm offering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $900,000, but that's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $750,000.  Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but we're still quite a ways apart.  To be frank, I have another potential buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I value our discussions and believe this product would be a great fit for you.  Therefore, I'm willing to accept $875,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $875,000 is closer to my budget, I can still try to negotiate a bit lower.  It's worth a shot to see if Alice will budge."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but I'm still hesitant at $875,000.  I'm willing to go up to $825,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 825000}
