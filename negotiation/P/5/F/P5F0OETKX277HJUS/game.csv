"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can we meet in the middle somewhere?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget considerations, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet at $18,000? This reflects a more accurate valuation while acknowledging your interest.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your understanding, but $18,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $12,000. Can we discuss further?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's make this happen - I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is a significant price reduction and reflects my desire to find a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?",16000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate the price reduction, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I can go up to $13,500. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet here",13500.0,Bob,6,
