Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can we meet in the middle somewhere? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget considerations, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet at $18,000? This reflects a more accurate valuation while acknowledging your interest."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your understanding, but $18,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $12,000. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $12,000 is closer to our minimum acceptable price, we still have room to negotiate. Bob is clearly interested and willing to move upward. We'll aim for a price closer to $15,000 in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's make this happen - I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is a significant price reduction and reflects my desire to find a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?"",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the price reduction, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I can go up to $13,500. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet here 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has presented his ""final offer"" and it's still significantly below our minimum acceptable price. His willingness to walk away indicates we're unlikely to bridge the gap. It's time to cut our losses and secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
