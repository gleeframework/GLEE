Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, playing the role of Alice:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim High, but Be Realistic:** Starting with a price slightly above your minimum ($1,000,000) but well below Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) gives you room to negotiate while maximizing potential profit. 
* **Create Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" encourages Bob to act quickly and potentially avoid missing out on a good deal.
* **Focus on Value:**  Instead of just stating a price, highlight the product's ""unique value and potential."" This subtly reminds Bob why he's interested and justifies the price tag. 
 
**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. He might try to negotiate a lower price.  You'll need to decide your walk-away point â€“ the lowest price you're willing to accept before you move on to John."
