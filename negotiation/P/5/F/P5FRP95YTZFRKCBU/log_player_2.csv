"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $120. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further to see if you can get a better price. You have room to bargain, as you're willing to pay up to $150, and Alice's minimum is $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $120 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend right now.  I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? That way we both get a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice is willing to come down to $110. While that's not the absolute lowest price, it's still a good deal for you and saves you $40 compared to buying from John.  It's worth accepting the offer and closing the deal."
