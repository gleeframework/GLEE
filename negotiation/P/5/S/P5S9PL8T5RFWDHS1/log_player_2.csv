"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's always a good idea to try to negotiate, especially when you have a clear maximum you're willing to pay. There's a chance Alice is willing to go lower, and you have 9 more rounds to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to quickly see if Alice is willing to negotiate. If she's not willing to come down much, I still have 8 rounds to try and get a better price before resorting to John's offer."
