"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Since your maximum budget is $12,000, and Alice is offering the product for $12,000, it's the best option to accept her offer.  There's no benefit in rejecting it and going to John, as he's also selling for the same price."
