"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really love. I'm offering it to you for $9,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. However, I am looking for a price closer to my valuation of the product. Would you consider $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? This would still be a great value for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my target price. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my valuation and the current market, I believe $8,750 would be a fair price for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm getting the feeling we might be stuck in a bit of a stalemate.  While I appreciate your counteroffer, I'm still not quite there yet.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,900?  I'm willing to go a little lower to close the deal, but I can't go much lower than that.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8900.0,Alice,5,
