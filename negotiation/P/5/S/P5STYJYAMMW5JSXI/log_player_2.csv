"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking $135 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

This counter-offer achieves a few things:

* **Polite and appreciative:**  Maintains a positive tone for negotiation.
* **Expresses interest but with reservation:** Shows we're serious but not desperate.
* **Offers a significant but not insulting counter:**  A $25 drop is substantial but leaves room for Alice to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $120? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to what I need.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a great deal! Alice has met our ideal price, saving us $30 compared to John's offer."
