"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a unique product that I believe would greatly enhance your endeavors and contribute significantly to your success. This product, valued at $800,000 by you, holds an even greater significance for me, as it represents a piece of my vision and passion. I am offering you the chance to own this product at a special introductory price of $1,200,000. This offer is designed to ensure that both parties benefit, providing you with exceptional value while allowing me to recoup a substantial portion of the product's intrinsic worth. I am confident that this investment will yield significant returns for you in terms of functionality, prestige, and possibly even financial gains. Please consider this offer carefully and let me know if you require any additional information or have questions about the product. I look forward to the possibility of working together. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's message is persuasive, the offered price of $1,200,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000 and the guaranteed price from John.  You can do better by rejecting this offer and pursuing the option to buy from John."
