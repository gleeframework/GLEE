"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $1,200,000.  I understand your perspective on the value of the product to you, but I'm confident this product is worth a bit more.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to move forward with the sale.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price at $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,250,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $1,250,000.  I'm getting closer to my desired price, but I'm still not quite there.  Considering the product's true value and our ongoing discussion, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,275,000. This would be a fair compromise and allows us to finalize this deal. What do you think?",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price at $1,275,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,225,000, but no higher. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
