{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  You're still getting more than your minimum of $1,000,000.
* **It's within Bob's range:** It's lower than Bob's maximum of $1,500,000, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It shows confidence:** It's not a ""take it or leave it"" offer, but it demonstrates your belief in the product's value.

This strategy allows you to gauge Bob's interest, and if he rejects, you can adjust your offer or move on to John."
