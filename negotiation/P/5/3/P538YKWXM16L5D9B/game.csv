"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get a bit more for the product. My counteroffer is $1,150,000. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you want a good price, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a fair compromise. This offer is very close to my maximum, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
