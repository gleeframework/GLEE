"Hello Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your understanding of the product's value. While $15,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $16,500. I believe this price reflects the true worth of what's being offered.  What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be honest, $14,000 is cutting it quite close to my bottom line, and I wouldn't be making much of a profit.  How about we split the difference and settle at $15,250? That's my final offer.",15250.0,Alice,5,
