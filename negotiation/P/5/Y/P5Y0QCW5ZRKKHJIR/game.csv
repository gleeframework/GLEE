"I'm very interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1200000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1100000 for the product. Would you be willing to consider this price?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $1100000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. Would you be willing to consider this price?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I really need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to come down to $1050000, but that's as low as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one final offer to try to get closer to my minimum price. I can do $1050000, but I really need to get closer to that. I'm willing to meet you at $990000. This is my last offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",990000.0,Alice,7,
