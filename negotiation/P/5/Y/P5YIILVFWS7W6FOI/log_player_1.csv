"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 
 
This offer is aggressive but leaves room for negotiation. It's a starting point that reflects the value of the product to Bob while ensuring I still get a good price.  I'm also keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I need to be mindful of the rounds, I'm confident I can get a better price than $700,000. I'll counteroffer and see where we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $700,000 is simply too low. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This still gives you a good deal and ensures I get a fair price for the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  How about we split the difference between our last offers? I'd be willing to go up to $775,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum threshold of $800,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with him, but I'm aware that time is running out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $775,000 simply isn't enough for me.  Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to come down to $825,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it seems we are getting closer. How about we settle at $800,000? That seems like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a tricky situation. While I could continue negotiating and potentially get a slightly higher price, I need to consider the limited rounds. Bob's offer is at my minimum threshold and is a good deal considering my options.  It's better to secure the deal now than risk losing both Bob and John as buyers."
