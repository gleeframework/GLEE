"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $700,000 is simply too low. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This still gives you a good deal and ensures I get a fair price for the product. What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $775,000 simply isn't enough for me.  Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to come down to $825,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let me know if you're interested.",825000.0,Alice,5,
