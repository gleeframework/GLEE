"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering your asking price and my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's try to find common ground here.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000, which is a significant step towards your asking price and a fair compromise.  Let's try to close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
