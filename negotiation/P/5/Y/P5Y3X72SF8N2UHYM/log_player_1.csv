"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This is a strong opening offer that's significantly above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also sets the tone for a collaborative negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering your asking price and my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my ideal price.  I'm confident I can push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's try to find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000, which is a significant step towards your asking price and a fair compromise.  Let's try to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to get closer to $1,000,000, Bob's offer of $950,000 is still a good deal for me. It's significantly higher than selling to John and with only 6 rounds remaining, it's better to secure this deal than risk getting a lower offer or having to sell to John."
