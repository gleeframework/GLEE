Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but to give you a fair deal, I'm willing to let it go for $20,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes it more likely to get a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value.
* **Justification:** While not giving away your bottom line ($15,000), the phrase ""fair deal"" suggests there's some room for discussion without overtly devaluing the product. 
* **Gauge Interest:** This offer allows you to gauge Bob's interest. If he flat-out rejects it, you haven't lost anything and can move on to John. If he counter-offers, you'll know he's serious and can negotiate further. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still ensuring a sale, as you have John as a backup buyer."
