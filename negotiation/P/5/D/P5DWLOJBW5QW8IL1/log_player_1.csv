"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am willing to pay $12500 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer.  While it's close to my minimum, I can potentially get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not quite ready to accept $12,500. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? That's a good compromise and still leaves you with a decent margin above your value for the product."", ""product_price"": 13250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. While I would like to pay less, I am willing to consider $13000 for the product. This still allows me to save some money compared to other offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer.  $13,000 is a good price considering my minimum and the potential for further negotiation.  It's likely that if I reject, Bob will either lower his offer or walk away, leaving me with only John's offer of $12,000."
