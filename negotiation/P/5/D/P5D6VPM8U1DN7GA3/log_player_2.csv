(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly the same price as buying from John. There's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer.  You might be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice, but the prompt doesn't give you that option.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer is the best choice as it leaves open the possibility of finding a better deal in the future."
