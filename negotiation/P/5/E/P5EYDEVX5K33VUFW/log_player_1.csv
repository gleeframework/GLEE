Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,500,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product, which is still a great value for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

You have three options:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is still outside my budget. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. This price represents a fair value for both of us and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

While Bob is increasing his offer, it's clear we're unlikely to reach a price that significantly surpasses John's offer. Accepting Bob's current offer would net $50,000 less than selling to John. It's not worth risking further negotiation rounds for such a small potential gain."
