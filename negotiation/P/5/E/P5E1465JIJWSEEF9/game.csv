"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your price point, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price. I'm proposing $11,500 for the product. It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find a compromise here.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $11,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,
