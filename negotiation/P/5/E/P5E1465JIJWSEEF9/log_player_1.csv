{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's value:** $12,000 is more than what Bob is willing to pay, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:**  $12,000 is less than your minimum of $15,000, but it's a good starting point. 
* **It's a reasonable offer:** $12,000 is a fair price for both parties, given the circumstances.

This offer gives Bob an incentive to negotiate, while still giving you some wiggle room to earn as much as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's better than his initial value of $10,000, it's still significantly less than my minimum of $15,000.  I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your price point, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price. I'm proposing $11,500 for the product. It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find a compromise here."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $11,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is close enough to my desired price point. It's still above my minimum of $15,000 and I'm willing to close the deal at this price to avoid the risk of further negotiation or rejection."
