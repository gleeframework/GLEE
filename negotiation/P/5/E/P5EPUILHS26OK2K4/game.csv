"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant return on investment you'll see.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That initial price is quite high for me. I'm more comfortable in the range of  $600,000.  Do you think we can find some middle ground there?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its true market value.  To move this forward, I can offer it to you for $1,900,000. I'm confident this price reflects a fair deal given the product's potential.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  While that's closer, it's still a big leap for me. Could you consider something closer to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit. I've tried to be flexible, but honestly,  $800,000 is significantly below what I can accept. To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I value our discussions and believe you would benefit greatly from this product. If you're willing to move closer to $1,600,000, I'm open to finding a solution that works for us both.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have other potential buyers, but that price is still too high for me.  I can go up to $900,000, but that's my absolute limit.  If we can't make a deal at that price, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",900000.0,Bob,6,
