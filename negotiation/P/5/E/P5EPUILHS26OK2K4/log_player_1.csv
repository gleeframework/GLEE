"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant return on investment you'll see."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  Beginning with a strong offer of $2,300,000 gives us room for negotiation. While it's significantly above Bob's perceived value, it's not so outrageous to scare him off immediately.  
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the ""unique value"" and ""potential"" of the product, subtly justifying the high initial price. 
* **Leaving Room for John:** We always have the option to walk away and accept John's offer of $1,500,000. It's important to keep this in mind throughout the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That initial price is quite high for me. I'm more comfortable in the range of  $600,000.  Do you think we can find some middle ground there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below both our minimum ($1,500,000) and his own perceived value ($800,000).  It's clear there's a large gap to bridge.  Accepting this offer would be a substantial loss. We're better off negotiating further and seeing if we can move Bob closer to a more acceptable price. We still have the option to sell to John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its true market value.  To move this forward, I can offer it to you for $1,900,000. I'm confident this price reflects a fair deal given the product's potential."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Drop:**  We're decreasing our price by $400,000, signaling flexibility on our end. However, we're still well above Bob's initial offer and our minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasis on Value:** We're reiterating the product's value and potential, aiming to justify the price difference and potentially nudge Bob to re-evaluate his perceived value.
* **Maintaining Negotiation Space:** This counter-offer leaves ample room for further negotiation while keeping us far from a desperation sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  While that's closer, it's still a big leap for me. Could you consider something closer to $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now offered his perceived value of $800,000.  While this is closer to his initial offer, it's still significantly less than our minimum.  We need to determine if we can push him further or if it's time to walk away and accept John's offer. Let's see if we can negotiate a bit more before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit. I've tried to be flexible, but honestly,  $800,000 is significantly below what I can accept. To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I value our discussions and believe you would benefit greatly from this product. If you're willing to move closer to $1,600,000, I'm open to finding a solution that works for us both."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Introducing Urgency (John):** We're subtly bringing in the competition by mentioning ""another buyer."" This creates a sense of urgency and potentially motivates Bob to negotiate more seriously.
* **Final Offer Stance:** By saying we're ""open to finding a solution,"" we imply this is our best offer, and accepting it depends on Bob's willingness to make a substantial move.
* **Strategic Price Point:**  $1,600,000 is still a significant profit margin. It also puts the ball firmly in Bob's court. If he's genuinely interested, he needs to counter with a much stronger offer. If not, we can confidently walk away knowing we have John's guaranteed offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you have other potential buyers, but that price is still too high for me.  I can go up to $900,000, but that's my absolute limit.  If we can't make a deal at that price, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to walk away. Bob's offer of $900,000 is still too far from our minimum of $1,500,000. He has stated this is his ""absolute limit,"" indicating he's unlikely to move significantly higher. 

We've negotiated fairly, introduced competition, and made our position clear. Holding out further risks losing both Bob and John's offers. Accepting John's guaranteed $1,500,000 is the most logical decision at this point."
