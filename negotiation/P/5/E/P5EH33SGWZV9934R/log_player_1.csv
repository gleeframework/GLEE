I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my desired price, I'm not quite ready to settle for that amount. I'm confident I can get closer to my target of $1,000,000."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand your position and appreciate your flexibility. However, based on my financial constraints, I would like to propose a price of $960,000 for the product. I believe this offers a good balance between the value of the product to me and the price you're asking. I look forward to your response.

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $1 million, $960,000 is a good price and ensures a sale. It's a better outcome than selling to John for $800,000."
