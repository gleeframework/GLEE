"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a high-end product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm looking for $15000 for it.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $15,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $8,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now thinking of selling the product for $11000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should continue to negotiate with Alice. While $11,000 is closer to his budget, there is still room for a better deal. He can try to get closer to his maximum budget of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should continue to negotiate.  He's getting closer to his target price, and Alice has shown a willingness to compromise.  He can still try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really close to my budget limit. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,750?  That would be a fair deal for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're close to your budget limit, Bob, but I'm not sure I can meet you at $9750. I'm willing to go up to $10200, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is getting closer to Bob's budget, but she's still not willing to go low enough.  Since Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, it's better for him to buy the product from John at his target price of $8,000. There's no guarantee Alice will come down further, and Bob is already getting close to his limit of 10 rounds. It's time to take the sure thing."
