"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a valuable asset that I believe would be a great addition to your portfolio. I understand this product holds significant value for you, and I'm confident we can reach an agreeable price. My minimum asking price is $850,000, but I'm open to discussing a mutually beneficial deal. Please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $850,000 is less than your $1,000,000 maximum, it's still a significant markup from her own valuation of $800,000. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal, potentially pushing Alice to lower her asking price closer to her valuation."
