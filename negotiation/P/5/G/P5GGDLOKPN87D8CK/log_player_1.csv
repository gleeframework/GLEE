Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I know it's worth a lot to you, so I'm proposing a price of $9,500.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting slightly lower than his maximum allows for some back and forth if Bob wants to negotiate. 
* **Secure a Good Deal:**  Even if Bob rejects the offer, you have a safe fallback with John at $8,000."
