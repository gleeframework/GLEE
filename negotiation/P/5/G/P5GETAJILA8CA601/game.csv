,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet closer to the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $17,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,500. Can we meet at that price?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a price that works for us.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $16,000? This is a very competitive price for a product of this value.",16000.0,Alice,5,
