"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $750,000 is still a bit low for me. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $850,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $800,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it, and it's closer to what I can comfortably afford. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,4,
