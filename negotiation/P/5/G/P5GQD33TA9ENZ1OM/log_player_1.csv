This is a starting point.  I'm aiming to get as much as possible, but I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $1,000,000.  I'll adjust my offers based on Bob's responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I'm willing to negotiate further if you're open to it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to accept a price that's significantly below what I consider the product's worth. I'll try to meet him in the middle with a counteroffer in the next round."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While $900,000 is lower than what I was hoping for, I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to reduce the price to $1,100,000. This price is still fair given the value of the product, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm making a counteroffer of $950,000. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable accepting it. I'm going to try to get a higher price with another counteroffer. I'm aware that John is waiting to buy, so I have some room to negotiate, but I don't want to lose too much."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $1,000,000. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a deal at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $975,000 is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum. I don't want to keep going back and forth, and John is waiting to buy for a solid $1,000,000.  It's time to go with the sure thing."
