"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider selling it for $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price considering the value the product offers.  Let me know if this works for you.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $90 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $97?",97.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $97 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to drop my price to $102. This is a very fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make a deal!",102.0,Alice,5,
