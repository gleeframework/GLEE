"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I know it's worth more to me, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,000 is simply not feasible for me.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This price is fair considering the value of the product and leaves some room for us both to feel good about the deal.  Let me know what you think.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. However, $7,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $7,500? This would give us both a fair price and allow us to move forward with the transaction. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $7,500.  At this point, John's offer of $8,000 is more favorable.  It's better to secure the product at a reasonable price than to risk the negotiations failing and potentially missing out entirely."
