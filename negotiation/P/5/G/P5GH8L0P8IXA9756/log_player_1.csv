{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I know it's worth more to me, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a bit lower than my minimum price of $12,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob an incentive to counter.  If Bob rejects, I'll reassess the situation and see if I want to continue negotiating with him or just sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, $6,000 is significantly below my minimum price and even below what the product is worth to him. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get a better counteroffer from him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,000 is simply not feasible for me.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This price is fair considering the value of the product and leaves some room for us both to feel good about the deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

This counteroffer is still above what the product is worth to Bob, but it's a significant step down from my initial offer. I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still protecting my own interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $8,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,000. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,000 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. However, $7,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $7,500? This would give us both a fair price and allow us to move forward with the transaction. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 7500}
``` 

I'm offering a price in the middle of our two last offers. This shows flexibility and a willingness to meet halfway. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the value of the product to both of us."
