Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the market rate.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I can't go as low as $850,000.  Would you consider $900,000?  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and provide significant value."", ""product_price"": 900000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is moving closer to my price, it's unlikely he'll reach a number I find acceptable.  It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
