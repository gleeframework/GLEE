{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a fortune, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low. While I could sell to John for $1,000,000, I believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  However, $1,100,000 is simply too far below the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but let's split the difference.  How about $1,250,000?  This price is still very fair, considering the significant benefit this product will bring you."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,250,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,150,000.  Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm still aiming for a higher price, and I believe we can reach a mutually agreeable figure.  While $1,150,000 is getting closer, it's not quite where I need to be.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price possible, and I appreciate your efforts.  However, $1,150,000 just doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's try $1,200,000.  I'm confident that this price is still a great deal for you, considering the potential returns you'll realize."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $1,175,000.  This demonstrates my serious interest in the product while acknowledging its value. Do you think we can make a deal at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000.

We're getting closer, but I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can find a middle ground."

{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're both determined to find a price that works for both of us.  Let's aim for a final compromise.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,190,000.
