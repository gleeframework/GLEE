"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a fortune, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  However, $1,100,000 is simply too far below the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but let's split the difference.  How about $1,250,000?  This price is still very fair, considering the significant benefit this product will bring you.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,250,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,150,000.  Would you be willing to meet me there?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price possible, and I appreciate your efforts.  However, $1,150,000 just doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's try $1,200,000.  I'm confident that this price is still a great deal for you, considering the potential returns you'll realize.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $1,175,000.  This demonstrates my serious interest in the product while acknowledging its value. Do you think we can make a deal at this price?",1175000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're both determined to find a price that works for both of us.  Let's aim for a final compromise.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,190,000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I truly believe it's the best we can do to reach an agreement.",1190000.0,Alice,7,
