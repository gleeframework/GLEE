This offer is higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring I get a decent price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I'm looking to get out of this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While I want to reach a deal, I'm not willing to compromise that much. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,250,000?  This would still allow you to gain a significant benefit from the product."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, but it's very close.  Given the risk of further negotiation and the opportunity cost of dealing with John, I'm willing to accept his offer and sell the product."
