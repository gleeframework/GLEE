You could try a counter-offer a bit higher than your last offer to show you are willing to negotiate and see if Alice will meet you halfway."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You have only one round left, and while Alice's offer is slightly higher than your last counteroffer, it's getting closer to your desired price range. It's likely that in the final round, Alice might not budge any further. Accepting this offer ensures you get the product for a price that's less than what you would pay John."
