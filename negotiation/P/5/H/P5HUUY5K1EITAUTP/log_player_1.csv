"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a good starting point, as it's a price that's below Bob's perceived value but still above my minimum acceptable price.  This leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob an incentive to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $130 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm countering with $135. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing flexibility while still maintaining a profit above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough call, as $125 is only slightly higher than what John is offering. However, with only 6 rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob is increasing. It's better to secure the sale now at a slightly lower price than risk losing out entirely and having to sell to John."
