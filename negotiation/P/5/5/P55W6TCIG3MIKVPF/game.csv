"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility.  However, $1,300,000 is a bit high for me at this time.  To start the negotiation, I'd like to offer $900,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This is a competitive price considering the potential benefits you'll gain.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm ready to make a serious offer of $1,000,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, while still allowing you to make a profit. Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, and I see you're serious about acquiring this.  However, we need to find a middle ground that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,075,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on this offer, but I'm still a bit above my ideal range. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000. This is a significant move for me, and I hope we can reach an agreement on this. It's close to your offer, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this price.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
