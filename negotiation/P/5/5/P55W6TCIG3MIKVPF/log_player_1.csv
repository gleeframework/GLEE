"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility.  However, $1,300,000 is a bit high for me at this time.  To start the negotiation, I'd like to offer $900,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This is a competitive price considering the potential benefits you'll gain."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm ready to make a serious offer of $1,000,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, while still allowing you to make a profit. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly willing to go higher, and we're still significantly above John's offer. It's time to push back a bit more but show we're still open to negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, and I see you're serious about acquiring this.  However, we need to find a middle ground that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,075,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1075000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're firm on this offer, but I'm still a bit above my ideal range. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000. This is a significant move for me, and I hope we can reach an agreement on this. It's close to your offer, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is clearly willing to meet us near the middle ground, and $1,025,000 is a substantial profit. It's always tempting to push for more, but there's a risk Bob might walk away if we push too hard. This offer represents a good balance of risk and reward."
