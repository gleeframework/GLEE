Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,100,000, but I'd like to propose a compromise that benefits both of us. I'll sell the product to you for $1,100,000, but I'd like to throw in some additional support and services that will enhance the product's value.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is within my budget and is a good deal, especially considering the added support and services she is offering.  While I would love to get the product for the $1,000,000 that John is offering, I'm confident that the additional value from Alice's offer will be worth the extra $100,000.  At this point, I think it's time to close the deal and avoid further negotiation."
