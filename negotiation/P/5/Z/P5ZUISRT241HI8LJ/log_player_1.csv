Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it can benefit you greatly. I'm asking for $1,190,000, which reflects its true worth and potential. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1190000
}
```

Here's why this offer makes sense:

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We know John acts as a safety net, guaranteeing Alice gets at least $1,200,000. Therefore, Alice should aim to get more than this from Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,190,000 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, while still ensuring Alice receives a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value.
* **Strategic Positioning:** The message emphasizes the product's value, potentially swaying Bob towards a higher price point. 
 
This strategy balances ambition with a realistic chance of Bob accepting the offer."
