"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $115. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $115 is within Bob's budget, it's not the best possible price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $115 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to go down to $105? "", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to strike a deal that benefits him while also being reasonable to Alice.  Offering $105 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows Alice to potentially make a profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $110 is a good compromise. It's within Bob's budget, and it's only $5 more than Bob's counteroffer.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might reject the next offer and Bob might end up paying the full $120 to John.  Accepting the offer secures a good deal for Bob without risking a higher price."
