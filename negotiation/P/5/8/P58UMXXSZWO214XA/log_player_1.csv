Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as much money as possible, and Bob is willing to pay more than John. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves space for Bob to negotiate down slightly while still ensuring I get significantly more than John's offer.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to entice Bob and justify the high price. 

By starting high but leaving room for negotiation, I maximize my chances of securing the best possible deal."
