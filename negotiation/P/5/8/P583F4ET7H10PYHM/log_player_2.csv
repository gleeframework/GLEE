Alice's offer is far too high.  It's better to try to negotiate with her or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product. If Alice is willing to come down to this price, I'll buy it. Otherwise, I'll buy it from John for $1,000,000."

While $1,750,000 is lower than her original offer, it's still more than I'm willing to pay. I'll try to negotiate further with Alice."

I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise considering your previous offer and my initial offer.  If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to purchase from John."

Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate further before buying from John."

I'm increasing my offer again to $1,400,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer and closer to her last one.  If this is unacceptable, I'll have to buy from John."
