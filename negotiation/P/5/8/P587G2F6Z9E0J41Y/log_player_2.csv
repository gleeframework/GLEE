"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high value and importance to you, I believe it's only fair to propose a price that reflects its true worth. Considering its significance, I would like to offer it to you for $12000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is less than Bob's maximum, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you valuing the product highly. However, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at the moment. Given my budget, I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints.

Please let me know if this proposal works for you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much as possible.  While $11,500 is better than Alice's initial offer, there is still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,500 is closer, but I'm still working with a tight budget.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your continued interest in the product, Bob. After reviewing your offer, I am willing to consider $11200 as a compromise. This price reflects the product's value while remaining within your budget. I hope this proposal will help us reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his desired price point.  $11,200 is within Bob's budget and represents a good compromise. Accepting the offer at this point is the best strategy to avoid further negotiation and ensure a purchase within a reasonable timeframe.  While there's always the possibility of getting a slightly lower price, the risk of Alice walking away or Bob having to buy from John for a higher price outweighs the potential savings."
