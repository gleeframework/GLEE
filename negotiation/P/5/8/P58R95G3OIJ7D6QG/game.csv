"Alice, $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  It's a fair price that reflects its value to me, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise between our initial offers.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still out of my price range. I'm sticking with my offer of $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good deal for everyone involved.  Let's make this happen.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $9,000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm counteroffering at $10,500. This price is closer to my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I really appreciate you coming down, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm going to stick with my offer of $9,000.  If you're not willing to go that low, I'm going to have to look at other options.",9000.0,Bob,6,
