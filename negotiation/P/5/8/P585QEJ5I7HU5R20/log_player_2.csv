Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer is still too high, even with the discount. It's worth continuing to negotiate.  $140 is closer to my limit, but I'm still hoping for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still above my budget.  How about we split the difference and settle on $110? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
