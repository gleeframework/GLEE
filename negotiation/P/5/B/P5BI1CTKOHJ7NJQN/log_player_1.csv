Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80 but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm curious to see what Bob's response will be."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $75 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my initial offer of $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm offering $90 as a counteroffer to Bob.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will be a more attractive offer for Bob, while still allowing me to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum acceptable price.  I'd rather not risk further negotiation and potentially losing the sale to John, who is also offering my minimum price.  Therefore, I'm accepting Bob's offer."
