"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you offering a competitive price, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to get a good deal, but I have to consider my costs and the value I've placed on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great value.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $8,500? This would allow us both to walk away with a good deal.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I'm not willing to go below $9,200. This is the lowest price I can accept, considering the value I've placed on the product. I'm confident you'll find it's still a great deal at this price.",9200.0,Alice,5,
