Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that we're getting close, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,125,000.

Alice's final offer is at $1,150,000.  While it is still above my ideal price, it's a good deal considering the product's value and the fact that John is willing to sell it to me for $1,000,000.  Accepting this offer means I'm saving $50,000 compared to buying from John."
