I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, hoping to maximize my profit. I'm also aware that I can always fall back on John's offer if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet. I'll counteroffer to see if I can squeeze out a bit more profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $12,000.  This is still a decent profit for me, and hopefully, it's attractive enough for Bob to consider."

Bob is clearly not willing to budge, and I've already made two counteroffers.  It's time to cut my losses and go with John's offer, as it guarantees me my minimum profit."
