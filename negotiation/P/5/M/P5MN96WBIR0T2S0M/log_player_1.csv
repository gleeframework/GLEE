Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm asking for $2,000,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start high.  This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:**  While the message doesn't explicitly state the product's value to Bob, it emphasizes ""potential"" and ""benefits"" to encourage him to accept the higher price.
* **Round number:**  Using a round number like $2,000,000 can make it seem like a carefully considered price.

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation. In a real-world scenario, you might adjust your strategy based on Bob's response and willingness to negotiate."
