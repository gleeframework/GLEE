"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for us to work together. I'm willing to offer you the product for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and get a lower price from Alice. You can always buy from John later if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $110 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  I'm willing to pay $90 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $100. It's a fair price considering the value it brings, and I think it's a good middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is closer to your desired price, you can likely get it lower. It's still worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $100 is still a little high for me.  How about we split the difference and agree on $95?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your proposal, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I can do better than that. I'm willing to offer you the product for $105. It's a fair price considering the value it brings, and I think it's a good compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $105 is getting closer to your desired price, it's still worth trying to negotiate further.  It's possible to get Alice to come down to a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $105 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try $97.50. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and would allow us to close this negotiation."", ""product_price"": 97.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with $97.50. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $102. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I think it's a good compromise. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's final offer of $102 is still higher than your desired price of $80. You have reached the point where you are better off buying from John, as the negotiations with Alice are unlikely to yield a better price."
