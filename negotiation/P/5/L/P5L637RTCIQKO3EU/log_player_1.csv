Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $150. I believe it offers excellent value at this price. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest level. If he immediately accepts, you know there might have been room to go even higher. If he rejects it, you can always lower the price or move on to John.
* **Alternative Option:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you're not desperate. This allows you to confidently aim higher with Bob."
