"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm interested in seeing if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is my minimum, I'm not willing to sell at that price just yet. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
``` 

I'm offering a counteroffer of $125. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping that Bob will find this price acceptable, as it's still above my minimum value and shows that I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price from Bob. I'm going to reject his offer again, as I have a few rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm going to lower my counteroffer slightly to $115. This is a more aggressive move, showing that I'm willing to be flexible but still want to earn more than my minimum.  I'm hoping Bob will realize that we're nearing the end of the negotiation and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only 4 rounds left, I'm running out of time to negotiate with Bob. Although I'd like to get a higher price, it's clear he's not willing to go above $100.  To ensure I don't risk getting nothing, I'll sell to John for $100. It's my minimum, but at least it's guaranteed."
