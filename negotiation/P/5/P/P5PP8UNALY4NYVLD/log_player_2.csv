# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,350,000 is fair.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
