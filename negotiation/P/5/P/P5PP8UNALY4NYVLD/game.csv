"Alice,  I appreciate your offer but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is quite a bit below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000? This offer reflects the product's worth while still providing you with a significant gain.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
