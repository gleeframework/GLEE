Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm confident this price reflects the product's true worth. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but it would need to be significantly lower for me to consider it. How about we try something around $650,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I need to achieve my goal. I will counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $650,000 is simply too far below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit to facilitate the deal. How about we meet at $900,000? This price still offers you a substantial benefit, and allows me to achieve my goals. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still a bigger leap than I can make right now. To be honest, anything over $800,000 just doesn't work for me financially.  Would you be willing to consider $725,000? That's a significant move on my end, and I'm hoping we can find some middle ground here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $725,000 is closer to my target, it's still below the minimum I'm willing to accept.  I'll counteroffer again in the next round.  I'm hoping to get closer to my goal with each round of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still unable to accept $725,000. It's crucial for me to stay above $800,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference -  how about $850,000? This price represents a fair compromise, allowing you to get a great deal while ensuring I achieve my financial goals. I'm confident this is a win-win solution for us both."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  While $850,000 is closer, it's still a stretch for my budget. I'm willing to offer $775,000 as my final offer.  I believe this is a fair price, and I'm hopeful you'll see the value in closing the deal today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $775,000 is still below my target, and we've only got a few rounds left.  While I'd love to close the deal with Bob, I'm not confident we'll reach an acceptable agreement in the remaining time.  I'll sell to John and ensure I meet my financial goals."
