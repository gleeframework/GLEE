"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is worth $100 to you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us. Would you like to purchase it at a special introductory price of $85?",85.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $85 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $75. Would you be willing to go that low for a quick sale?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. Let me make a counterproposal. How about we aim for a middle ground at $80 for the product? This still gives you a good savings while allowing us to maintain a fair price.",80.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $80 is closer to my target, but I'm still hoping to get it for $77.  Let's see if we can find a happy middle ground here.",77.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for your persistence. I'm glad we're able to narrow down the price. Considering the value of the product and your interest, how about we settle on $79 for the product? It's a bit higher than your proposal but still offers a good saving compared to the original price.",79.0,Alice,5,
