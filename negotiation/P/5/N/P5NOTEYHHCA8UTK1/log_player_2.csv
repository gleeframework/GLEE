{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The product is far too expensive at $1,300,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

I'm offering Alice my maximum price. This is the price I'd pay John, so it's unlikely I'll get a better deal elsewhere. If Alice rejects, I'll have to consider buying from John."

Alice has lowered the price, but it's still above my maximum. I'll try to counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}

I'm offering Alice a price in the middle ground between her offer and my maximum. This shows I'm serious about negotiating, but also sets a clear limit."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is getting closer to my target, I'm still willing to negotiate. I'll see if I can get a better price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

I'm offering a price slightly higher than my previous counteroffer, showing flexibility. This might be a good middle ground for both of us, considering the rounds remaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is still too high. I've only got 3 rounds left, and I don't want to risk losing out on the product if she keeps rejecting my counteroffers. It's time to go with the guaranteed deal with John."
