"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a bit outside my budget. I would be willing to pay $600,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $600,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, $1,100,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you consider $700,000?  I believe that's a fair offer.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $700,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still below my bottom line.  I'm willing to accept $950,000. This is my final offer.  Let me know if this works for you.",950000.0,Alice,5,
