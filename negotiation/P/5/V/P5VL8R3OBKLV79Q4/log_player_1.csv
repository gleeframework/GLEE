{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it extremely valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation and still allows me to profit. 

I'm keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $1,500,000, so I have a safety net if the negotiation with Bob falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'm willing to negotiate,  $900,000 is not even close to my minimum acceptable price. I will reject his offer and attempt to negotiate a better price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to be closer to my initial asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This would give you a significant discount while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your initial offer and my original counteroffer. How about we try $1050000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,050,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not quite there.  I want to see if I can push for a bit more. I'll reject his offer and try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one final concession. How about we settle at $1,125,000? This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to achieve our objectives. If you're not willing to go this high, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1125000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1125000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to make a final offer of $1050000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options, including buying from John for $1000000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's final offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. It's clear that we can't reach an agreement that works for both of us.  I'm better off selling to John for $1,500,000 and securing a much better price."
