Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to be closer to my initial asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $1100000? This would give you a significant discount while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.

This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to achieve our objectives. If you're not willing to go this high, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.
