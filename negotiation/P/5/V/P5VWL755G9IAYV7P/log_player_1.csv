Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $180. It's a good starting point that is higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will accept, but if he doesn't, I'm prepared to counter his offer.  It's always good to start a little high!"

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $170. This is a compromise that's closer to my ideal price but still shows I'm willing to be flexible and find a solution we both can agree on."
