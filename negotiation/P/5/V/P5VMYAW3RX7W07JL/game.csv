"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $9,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'd still need a bit more to make this work.  How about $9,500?  That's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,250? It's a fair price for both of us.",9250.0,Bob,4,
