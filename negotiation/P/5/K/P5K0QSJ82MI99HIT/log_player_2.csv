"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to part with it for a price of $1300000. This is a great deal, considering the value it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I'm not sure if I should accept or reject Alice's offer. If I accept, I'll save $200,000 compared to buying from John, but I'll still be paying more than Alice's value of the product. If I reject, I can try to negotiate with Alice or look for a better deal, but I might end up paying the full $1,500,000 to John.
