Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $119. I believe it's a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($120) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $119 leaves a small window for potential negotiation if Bob wants to counter-offer.
* **Secure the Sale:** Offering a price slightly below Bob's valuation makes it highly likely he'll accept, preventing the need to sell to John for a lower price."
