Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price reflects that. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  You're already making a profit, and leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's significantly lower than Bob's value:** This incentivizes Bob to accept, as he knows he's getting a good deal.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** This allows you to potentially reach a higher price if Bob is willing to negotiate.

Remember, you can always choose to sell to John for $8,000 if the negotiations with Bob don't go your way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly below your desired profit margin. It's worth seeing if you can push Bob higher with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. This still leaves you a good deal, and it's a price I can live with. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows willingness to compromise:** You've moved from your initial offer, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Leaves room for further negotiation:**  Bob might still be willing to pay a bit more, and there's room to adjust if needed.
* **Keeps the deal alive:**  You're not shutting the door on a potentially good deal by immediately accepting his offer or selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $9,500. This is the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would love to get closer to my initial goal, $9,500 is a good profit and a better deal than selling to John.  It's also likely that Bob won't go any higher, so accepting his offer secures a sale."
