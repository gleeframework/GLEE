"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to offer it to you for $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the product holds value, but $17,000 is still above my budget.  Could we settle at $11,500?  That's a fair compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to make a deal.  However, $11,500 is just too low. I can go down to $15,500, but that's my absolute final offer.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, your final offer is tempting, but still a stretch. I can do $12,000, which is my absolute limit.  If that doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",12000.0,Bob,6,
