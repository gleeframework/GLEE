"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $12000 is a bit over my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9500.  Let's see if we can find a deal that works for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10750? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. ",10750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $10750 is still a bit too high for me.  Considering the value to me, I'm willing to go up to $10250.  This price is fair and allows both of us to reach an agreement.  What do you think?",10250.0,Bob,4,
