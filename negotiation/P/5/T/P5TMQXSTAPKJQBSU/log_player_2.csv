{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject the offer.  While $15,000 is the maximum he's willing to pay, there's no reason to pay that much immediately. Bob has 10 rounds to negotiate and potentially get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, and with only a few rounds left, it's becoming riskier to keep rejecting offers. $13,500 is a good price, and accepting this offer saves Bob $1,500 compared to buying from John.  It's a good compromise that achieves Bob's goal of saving money while still securing the product."
