"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me at this time. I'm willing to pay $750,000, which is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than you're comfortable with, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $950,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product, and it's closer to the initial offer I made. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",950000.0,Alice,3,
