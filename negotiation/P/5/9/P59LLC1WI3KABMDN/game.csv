"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's significantly above my budget.  I'm very interested in this product but I can only offer $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on it and allows for a good profit for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and I'm glad to hear that you're willing to make a serious offer. However, I was hoping we could meet somewhere in the middle. My counteroffer is $1,100,000, which is a compromise between my initial offer and your counteroffer. I believe this price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair profit for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your desire to make a profit, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer.  This price reflects a fair compromise and allows us to finalize this deal quickly.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad to see you're willing to meet me halfway. However, I still believe the product's value is worth more than $950,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,000,000, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. I'm confident this price will be a fair deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
