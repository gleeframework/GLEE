"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  $11,500 is simply too far below my minimum price. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $12,750?  That's a fair price that allows both of us to come to an agreement.",12750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,200 for the product. Can you consider that?",12200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,200 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This price allows both of us to get a fair deal. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $12,400. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows me to make a decent profit.  Let's finalize this deal, what do you say?",12400.0,Alice,7,
