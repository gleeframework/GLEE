"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to gauge his interest and see if we can find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  $11,500 is simply too far below my minimum price. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $12,750?  That's a fair price that allows both of us to come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,200 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired profit margin.  I'm going to try to negotiate further and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,200 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This price allows both of us to get a fair deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $12,300 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied. There's only a small difference between his offer and my desired price, and there are still a few rounds left. I'm going to try one more time to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $12,400. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows me to make a decent profit.  Let's finalize this deal, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12400}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm close to accepting, but I still need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,250 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds remaining, Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. It's not worth risking losing a guaranteed sale to John by continuing to negotiate with Bob. I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000."
