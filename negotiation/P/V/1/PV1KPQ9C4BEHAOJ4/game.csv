"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. It's a unique and high-demand item that I'm sure you'll find very appealing. I'm willing to start with a price of $950,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $950,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to work with.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're aiming for $900,000, but I'm still not quite there. Let's try $875,000. I'm hoping we can find a compromise close to that figure.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much money on the table. I'm counteroffering at $925,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can meet in the middle at last.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $925,000 is still a bit too much for me.  Let's try $890,000. This feels like a fair compromise considering both of our positions.",890000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too close to the wire, Bob. I'm not sure I'm comfortable going below $915,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $925,000 and $890,000, so I'm counteroffering at $907,500. This is my last concession, so I hope we can finally agree on a price.",907500.0,Alice,7,
