"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. It's a unique and high-demand item that I'm sure you'll find very appealing. I'm willing to start with a price of $950,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  It's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can likely get a better price by rejecting and making a counteroffer. 
* **Buying from John is an option, but not ideal.**  You can potentially get a better deal with Alice, saving yourself $100,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $950,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to work with."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $900,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still too high.**  While it's better than her initial offer, it's still above my ideal price point. 
* **There's still room for negotiation.** I believe I can get the price lower with another counteroffer. 
* **Buying from John is still an option, but not ideal.** I'd prefer to save money if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're aiming for $900,000, but I'm still not quite there. Let's try $875,000. I'm hoping we can find a compromise close to that figure."", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much money on the table. I'm counteroffering at $925,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can meet in the middle at last. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  It's closer to my target, but I'm still willing to negotiate further.
* **There's still time for a better deal.**  I have several rounds left to try and reach a lower price.
* **Buying from John is an option, but not ideal.**  I'm confident I can get a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $925,000 is still a bit too much for me.  Let's try $890,000. This feels like a fair compromise considering both of our positions."", ""product_price"": 890000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too close to the wire, Bob. I'm not sure I'm comfortable going below $915,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $925,000 and $890,000, so I'm counteroffering at $907,500. This is my last concession, so I hope we can finally agree on a price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $907,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $907,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to my target.**  While it's not the absolute lowest price I'd hoped for, it's within a reasonable range.
* **We're running out of time.**  It's getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal.
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.** However, Alice's offer is closer to my ideal price.

This decision balances the desire for a lower price with the risk of losing the deal entirely and having to buy from John for a higher price."
