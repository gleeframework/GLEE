"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $2,000,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While I understand your position, the product's value is significantly higher than your proposed price.  I could consider letting it go for $1,800,000. This is a compromise, reflecting its true worth."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the reply. I appreciate the movement, but $1,800,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Could we settle around $1,400,000? I feel that's a fair price that reflects its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly interested and getting closer to a reasonable offer. We're still significantly above John's offer, so it makes sense to counter and see if we can push a little closer to $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000? This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** This counter-offer puts some pressure on Bob by presenting it as a final offer while still leaving room to accept his price if he counters in the next round. We are now getting very close to John's offer, so we need to be prepared to walk away soon if Bob doesn't meet our desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate you saying it's your final offer, but I can't quite meet that price. How about $1,450,000 and we have a deal? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is inching up and we're now only $50,000 away from John's offer.  While we could try to squeeze a bit more, there's a real risk Bob walks at this point, and gaining an extra $50,000 isn't worth potentially losing the deal entirely. It's time to accept and lock in the profit."
