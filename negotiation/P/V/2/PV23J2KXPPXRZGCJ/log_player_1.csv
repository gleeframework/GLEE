{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm happy to offer it to you for $130.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit lower than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It's a good starting point to see if Bob is interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to keep my budget around $80. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $80 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum of $150. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob,  I appreciate your interest! While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a little more. How about we meet in the middle at $115?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm offering $115, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. I'm hoping this will be a good compromise and get the negotiation moving."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand your position, but I still believe that $80 would be a fair price for both of us. Would you consider meeting me halfway at $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough for me. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $95 is still a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to go down to $105. This would be a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to stick with my strategy of making small compromises, but not going below my minimum price.  $105 is still a decent profit for me, and hopefully, Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am still aiming for $80, as it fits within my budget. Could we possibly reach an agreement at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is stubbornly sticking to his $80 offer, and I'm not willing to go that low.  My minimum is $150, and I'm not going to lose money on this deal.  It's time to move on and sell to John."
