"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, this product is worth $1200000 to me, but I'm willing to make a compromise to get it into your hands. I'm offering it to you for $900000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $900000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850000 for it.  This is a fair price, considering I'm paying more than John is offering.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to let the product go for $850000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm offering you a new deal: $875000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $875000 is still slightly above what I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - I'm offering $862500. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.  What do you think?",862500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to let the product go for $862500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm offering you a new deal: $887500. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",887500.0,Alice,5,
