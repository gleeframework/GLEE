"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a price below its worth to you, and I get a significant return on my investment. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  This price is still a good deal for you, as you'll make a profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This still leaves a good profit margin for you, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to find common ground here.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
