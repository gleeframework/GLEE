"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. It's a unique item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is at your maximum price point. 
* There's no immediate reason to accept. 
* Rejecting the offer allows for potential negotiation and hopefully a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you showing me the product. However, $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested, but I'd like to offer $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Opening Counter:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's price, demonstrating a serious interest in the product while initiating negotiation. 
* **Reasonable Margin:** $100 leaves room for potential compromise and a price point you are comfortable with.
* **Open-Ended Message:** The message invites Alice to continue the conversation and potentially counter with her own price adjustments."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $110. It's a good middle ground, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal. What do you think?
