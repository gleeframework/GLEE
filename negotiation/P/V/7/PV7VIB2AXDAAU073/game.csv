"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to get a good price.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $110 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $125 for it. This still leaves you with a good deal considering the product's value to you.  Let me know if you're interested in this price.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $125 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $115. Can you consider this price?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $115 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  Let's try $120. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",120.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $118, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",118.0,Bob,6,
