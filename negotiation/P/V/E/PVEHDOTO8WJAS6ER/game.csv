"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than the value it holds for you. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price point.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still leaves significant value for you, and it's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,100,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $950,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer the product for $1,050,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $980,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. How about we meet in the middle at $1,015,000? This price is a good compromise, and it gives you a great deal while still allowing me to achieve a fair return. Let's make this happen.",1015000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,015,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $980,000 and $1,050,000, so I'll offer $1,015,000 is a bit too high for me. How about $990,000? I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",990000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're almost there! To finalize this deal, I'm willing to accept $995,000. It's a good deal for both of us, and I believe we can call it a day. What do you say?",995000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $995,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you at $985,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",985000.0,Bob,10,
