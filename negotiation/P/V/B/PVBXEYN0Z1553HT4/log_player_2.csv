"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for offering! While I appreciate the product's uniqueness, $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

This counter-offer does a few things:

* **Acknowledges Alice's offer and the product's value:** This maintains a positive tone and shows respect for Alice's position.
* **States the offer is too high:** This is direct and honest about the price not being feasible. 
* **Offers a significantly lower counter-offer:** This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm serious about getting a good deal. 
* **Keeps the tone polite and open to further discussion:**  The goal is to find a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $60 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is closer to a reasonable price, it's still above my $80 limit.  I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get Alice closer to my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle on $75? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive reinforcement:** I acknowledge Alice's movement by saying I appreciate the compromise.
* **Clear counter-offer:**  $75 is a specific number that is a significant step from my previous offer but also moves closer to Alice's last price.
* **Framing as ""fair"":** By positioning this price as a fair compromise, I'm subtly encouraging Alice to view it favorably. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While $75 is my target, I'm leaving space for a potential final round of back-and-forth."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $75. I'll offer you a new price of $85. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is getting closer to my limit, but I'm still willing to see if I can get the price down to $80. It's worth one more try."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're really close! I'm willing to make this my final offer: $80.  That's the absolute best I can do."",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and assertive:** I'm stating clearly this is my final offer to encourage Alice to seriously consider it. 
* **Hitting my limit:** Offering $80 aligns with my budget and avoids overspending. 
* **Still respectful:** I'm not demanding or using harsh language, maintaining a professional tone. 
* **Creating a sense of urgency:** By labeling it my ""final offer,"" I'm prompting a decision from Alice."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your final offer, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $80. I'll offer you a new price of $92. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.

Alice has increased her price after I presented my final offer. This indicates she's not willing to meet my budget.  It's time to cut my losses and take advantage of John's guaranteed offer of $80."
