"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $140 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $110. What do you think?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest.  While I'm willing to come down a bit, $110 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $125?  It's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $125 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to pay $120.  It's a good price for both of us, and avoids us having to go back and forth any more.",120.0,Bob,4,
