(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible.  Offering $900,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, and still within the $1,000,000 budget.  This counteroffer demonstrates Bob's seriousness about purchasing the product while also leaving room for further negotiation if Alice rejects."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $920,000 is a compromise and is closer to Bob's previous counteroffer.  This price is still within Bob's budget and represents a significant saving compared to buying from John. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price without risking further negotiation or the possibility of Alice rejecting a subsequent counteroffer."
