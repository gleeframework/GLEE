"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a bit above Bob's value for the product, but still gives me room to negotiate. I'm also trying to build a bit of rapport with a friendly message."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $85. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to get closer to my value. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $92.50?"", ""product_price"": 92.5}
``` 

I'm trying to meet Bob halfway with this offer, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my value.  I'm hoping this shows flexibility and encourages him to come up a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with $90 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I need to get a higher price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a bit more.  How about $95?  It's a good compromise and a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm trying to inch closer to my desired price while still being reasonable.  I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a good deal and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I've considered your latest offer and would like to propose $93 for the product. This feels like a fair compromise for both of us. Please let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $93. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $93
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $93 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I need to get a higher price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $93 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to accept $94 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 94}
``` 

I'm trying to close the gap by offering a price that's only slightly higher than Bob's latest offer.  I'm hoping that this will be enough to persuade him to accept, as we're getting close to a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've thought about your last proposal and I'm willing to go up to $93.50 for the product. This feels like a reasonable compromise given our previous discussions. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $93.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $93.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John.  While I'm getting closer to my desired price with Bob, I'm running out of time and need to secure a sale. John is offering my minimum acceptable price, and I can't risk losing that opportunity."
