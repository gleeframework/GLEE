"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for $850,000. I believe it's a fair price, given its value to both of us. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $800,000, and Alice is asking for $850,000. 
* **Negotiation is worthwhile.** There are 10 rounds, so there's room to negotiate a better price. 
* **John's offer is a safety net.** You can always buy from John if you can't reach a deal with Alice."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $850,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000, which is still a significant value for you. This offer reflects the product's true worth and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's closer to your desired price, it's still above your limit of $800,000.
* **More negotiation is possible.**  There are still 7 rounds left. 
* **John's offer is still a safe option.** If you can't get the price down to $800,000 or less, you can always buy from John."
