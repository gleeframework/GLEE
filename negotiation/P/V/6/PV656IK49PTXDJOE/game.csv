"I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $10,500?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. However, $9,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $10,250? It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial price, but $10,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $9,000. How about $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
