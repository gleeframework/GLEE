"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're interested in the product and appreciate your offer. However, $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This price reflects the product's true value and is still a great deal for you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,500. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a deal at that price.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $13,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $14,250.  This price is closer to your offer and still allows me to make a reasonable profit.  I'm hopeful we can finalize a deal at this point.",14250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit away from my target price. I'm willing to meet you at $14,500, which is just $500 above your previous offer. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a deal at that price.",14500.0,Bob,6,
