# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $10,750.

It's clear Alice is not budging much from her initial offer. It's unlikely we'll get a price significantly lower than $12,000.  At this point, cutting our losses and buying from John for $15,000 is the best option to avoid potentially overpaying after more rounds."
