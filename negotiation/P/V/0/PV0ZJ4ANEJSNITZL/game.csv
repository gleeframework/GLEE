"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but only if I can get it closer to $7,000. Would you consider that?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a great deal for you, and a fair price for me. What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, $7,000 is quite a drop.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere, say $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
