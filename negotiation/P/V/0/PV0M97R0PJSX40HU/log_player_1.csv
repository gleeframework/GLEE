Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable, for $140."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $140 aims to capture a significant portion of the value difference ($50) between what Bob values it at and your minimum acceptable price.

This strategy balances maximizing your potential profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
