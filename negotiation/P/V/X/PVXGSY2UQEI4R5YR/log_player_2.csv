Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your budget constraints, but $60 is significantly lower than its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $120?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. $120 is still a bit too steep for me.  Could you do $75? I think that's a fair offer."",

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to get a reasonable price for this product.  How about $100? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to her minimum price ($100, her value for the product).  It's unlikely she'll go lower. Since we have the option to buy from John for $80, it makes more sense to take that deal and save the $20."
