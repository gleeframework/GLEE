Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. I'm willing to sell it for $19,000.  Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you can aim higher with Bob. 
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting with a significantly higher price ($19,000) leaves room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, bringing the price closer to his perceived value of $12,000, but still potentially higher than your minimum.
* **Risk Assessment:** There's a risk Bob might reject a high offer outright. However, the potential for a much higher profit outweighs the risk of losing him as a buyer, especially since you have John as a backup. 

**Important:** This is just one strategy. You could adjust your initial offer based on your risk tolerance and how aggressively you want to negotiate."
