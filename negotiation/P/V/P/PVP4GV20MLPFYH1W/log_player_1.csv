"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a steal considering its value to you!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Initial Offer:** Starting with a price higher than the product's worth to Bob gives us room to negotiate downwards.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the potential benefit to Bob,  making the offer more appealing. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The offer is not so unreasonable that Bob would immediately reject it, leaving the door open for further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $600,000 is significantly below the product's worth to me.  
* **Negotiation potential:**  There's still room for negotiation,  and I can likely get a higher price by counter-offering.
* **Selling to John is not ideal:** While selling to John guarantees $1,000,000, I can potentially get closer to my desired $1,000,000 or even higher by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects the value of the product for you, and allows us both to get a fair deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a strong justification:**  I'm not going to drastically lower my price.  Instead, I'm offering a price that's still profitable for me while acknowledging Bob's perspective. 
* **Appeal to fairness:**  By highlighting the value of the product to Bob, I'm appealing to his sense of fairness and making the counteroffer more acceptable. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  I'm leaving room for further negotiation, but I'm getting closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $900,000 is still pushing it for me. I could do $700,000. That's a substantial offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:**  While Bob has increased his offer, $700,000 is still significantly lower than the product's worth to me. 
* **Negotiation leverage:**  I've already lowered my price considerably. Bob is likely to come up in his next offer, and I want to see if he's willing to get closer to my desired price point.
* **Selling to John is risky:**  Although selling to John guarantees $1,000,000, I'm only three rounds away from a potential deal with Bob that could yield a higher price.  I'm willing to risk it for the chance of a better outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $700,000 is still not close to the value of this product.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $850,000.  It's a fair price that recognizes the value of the product for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This counteroffer is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm serious about making a deal. It also demonstrates that I'm willing to be flexible.
* **Emphasizing value:**  I'm still highlighting the value of the product to Bob, reminding him of the benefit of acquiring it.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This offer is still above Bob's last offer,  giving him the opportunity to counter with a price closer to mine, and possibly leading to a deal in the next round."
