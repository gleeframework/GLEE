"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to consider a price of $1200000? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is equal to the minimum price I'm willing to accept, I'll choose option 1.
