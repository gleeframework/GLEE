"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $1500000. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident will bring you a lot of value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you're trying to save as much money as possible, it's always better to try and negotiate a lower price. Even though Alice's offer is the same as John's, there's no harm in trying to get a better deal from Alice. There's a chance she may be willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,500,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to consider a price of $1,200,000? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
