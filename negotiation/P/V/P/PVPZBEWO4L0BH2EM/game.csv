"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to consider a price of $1200000? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
