"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is significantly less than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle? Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $11,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget. How about $7,500? I think that's a fair offer.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but I need to get a fair price for this product.  $9,000 is my final offer, and I think it's a very reasonable compromise.",9000.0,Alice,5,
