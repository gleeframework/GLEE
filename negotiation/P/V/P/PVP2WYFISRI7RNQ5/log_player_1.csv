Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I'd accept from John. This is to see if I can get closer to my desired price. If Bob accepts, great! If not, I'll be ready to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further but I'm not going to settle for such a low price right away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from my initial offer, but still keeping it above my minimum acceptable price. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I won't go too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now higher than what John is willing to pay. While it's still lower than my ideal price, I'm accepting it to avoid the risk of losing a sale altogether."
