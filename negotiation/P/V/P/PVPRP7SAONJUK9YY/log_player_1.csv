Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $10,000.
* **Bob's Value:**  Bob values the product at $12,000.
* **Your Backup:** You have a guaranteed sale for $10,000 to John.

**Strategy**

The key is to offer a price that's attractive to Bob (saving him money compared to his perceived value) but also maximizes your profit.  Offering a price closer to $12,000 gives you the best chance of a larger profit.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I know it's something you'll find valuable. I'm willing to let it go for $11,500.  This is a great deal considering its worth to you."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing value for Bob and your willingness to make a deal.
* **Price:** $11,500  
    * Leaves Bob with a perceived savings of $500.
    * Earns you $1,500 more than your guaranteed sale. 

**Important Note:** Negotiation is fluid. Bob might counter-offer.  Be prepared to potentially negotiate down slightly, but always keep your $10,000 minimum in mind."
