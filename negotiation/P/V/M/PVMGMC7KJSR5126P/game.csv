"I understand that you're looking to get a good deal, Bob. However, I've done my research and I'm confident that this product is worth more than what you're offering. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with a price of $13000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to meet me at this price.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm starting to think you're a tough negotiator, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $12000, but I'm not going to go any lower than that. I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal - I'll include a complimentary accessory that's worth $500. So, the total price would be $12500. This is my final offer.",12500.0,Alice,5,
