"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. $10000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $12000, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I'm still interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",11000.0,Bob,4,
