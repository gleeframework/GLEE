"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $120, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $165? It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $165 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really hoping to stay within my budget of $120.  Would you be willing to consider $135?",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I've already come down a bit from my initial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit. How about we try $155? It's a compromise, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",155.0,Alice,5,
