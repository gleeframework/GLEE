Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I'm counteroffering at $1050000. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still slightly higher than what John is offering. It's worth another round of negotiation to see if Alice is willing to go lower."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you at $1025000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is still slightly higher than what John is offering.  Given that she's stated it's her final offer, there's no reason to believe she'll go lower.  It's best to accept John's offer to avoid paying more and save some money."
