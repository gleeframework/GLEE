"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product! I've done some research and I think it's worth a lot to you, so I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $13,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $11,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,500. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  However, $12,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I would be happy to close the deal at this price.",12000.0,Bob,4,
