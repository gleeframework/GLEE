"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to own a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to me is at least $12000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $12000? I believe this would be a fair compromise.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13500. This is still a great deal, considering its true value to me is at least $12000. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

I'm willing to make one more adjustment and offer it to you for $13250. This is the lowest I can go, considering its true value to me is at least $12000. What do you think?",13250.0,Alice,5,
