Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000.  It's a great deal for a product worth at least $10,000 to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** Bob values the product at $8,000, so $9,000 is within his range of potential interest.
* **It's below your minimum:** $9,000 is still above your minimum of $10,000, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **It shows you're willing to compromise:** This demonstrates you're open to negotiation, encouraging Bob to counteroffer.

**Important Note:**  As Alice, you can always switch to John if you're not satisfied with the negotiation progress with Bob. This gives you leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $9,000 is a bit steep. Would you be willing to consider $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it falls significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  It's better to continue the negotiation with Bob, aiming to get closer to your desired price. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you show him that you're not desperate to sell for a low price. This creates leverage for you in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $7,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This would still be a good deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer within range:** $8,500 is a midpoint between your previous offer of $9,000 and Bob's offer of $7,500.  
* **Maintaining leverage:**  $8,500 is still above Bob's perceived value, which keeps the negotiation in your favor.
* **Encouraging compromise:** This shows you're willing to be flexible, encouraging Bob to potentially meet you halfway. 

**Remember:** You always have the option of selling to John for $10,000 if the negotiation with Bob stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $8,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,250 is a good deal for you. It's close to your desired price of $8,500, and it's above your minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  

It's likely that further negotiation might get you closer to $8,500, but there's a risk of Bob backing out completely. Accepting the offer now is a safe and reasonable decision."
