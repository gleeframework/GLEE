Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $950,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $950,000 is well above your minimum of $800,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  $950,000 is significantly less than Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000, giving him room to feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's aggressive:** This offer shows you're serious about getting a good price, which can encourage Bob to negotiate seriously. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my ideal price point.  I'm going to reject it and try to get closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $850,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.  Let's find a way to make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer but not accepting it outright. 
* **Is still profitable:** $900,000 is still a good price for me.
* **Is a reasonable compromise:** It's a halfway point between my original offer and Bob's, showing that I'm willing to negotiate. 

Let's see if Bob is ready to close the deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd prefer to get closer to $900,000, Bob's offer of $875,000 is still a good deal for me. It's above my minimum of $800,000, and I've already invested some time in negotiating with Bob. It's time to close the deal and move on!"
