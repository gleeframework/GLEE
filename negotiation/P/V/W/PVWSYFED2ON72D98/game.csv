"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $100. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $140. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $115 is a compromise, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to offer it to you for $130, which is still a great deal. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",130.0,Alice,5,
