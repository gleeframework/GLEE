"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product before I list it publicly. I think it would be very valuable for you. I'm willing to part with it for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget ($110 < $120).**
* **Buying from Alice is cheaper than buying from John ($110 < $120).**

Although you could potentially get the product for a lower price by rejecting Alice's offer and negotiating with John, it's not guaranteed.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product within your budget and avoids the risk of a higher price with John."
