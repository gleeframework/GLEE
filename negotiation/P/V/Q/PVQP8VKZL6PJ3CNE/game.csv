"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $10,000. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I can meet you halfway, so I'm willing to offer the product to you for $14,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $14,000 is closer, it's still a bit out of my budget.  Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,500. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  $13,500 is still a little high for me. How about we settle at $11,500? That would work for me.",11500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I can see that we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I get a price that's closer to my minimum. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,800. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",12800.0,Alice,7,
