{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,200,000. I know this product holds significant value for you, and I believe this is a fair price considering its potential return on investment. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $800,000 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Maximizing Profit:**  There's a window to negotiate above your minimum but below Bob's maximum. 
* **The Offer:**  $1,200,000 leaves a potential profit of $300,000 for Bob, making it more tempting for him to accept while securing a substantial profit for you.

**Important:** This initial offer leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer."
