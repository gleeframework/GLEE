Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but it gives me room to negotiate. Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, this is a reasonable starting point to gauge his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still a bit lower than I'd like. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800}
```

I'm counteroffering at $9,800. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still leaving some room for negotiation.  I believe this price is fair, considering I'm only $200 away from his offer and still above my minimum threshold."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,600 is a reasonable compromise, and it's only a small distance from my initial target of $9,800. I'm happy to accept his offer to finalize the sale and avoid further negotiation."
