Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters with a lower offer.  It's important to note that this is just the first step. I'll be closely watching Bob's reaction and adjusting my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a higher price. I believe there's still room to negotiate upwards, and I'm willing to push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still keeps the price above my minimum.  I want to see if Bob is willing to come up a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is a good compromise, and it's getting closer to my desired price point. While I'd prefer to sell for more, the risk of him walking away entirely is high. Accepting his offer ensures a solid profit while minimizing the chances of losing a sale."
