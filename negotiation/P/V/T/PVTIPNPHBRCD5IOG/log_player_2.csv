Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and sell it to you for $90. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

It's clear Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $90.  It's time to cut your losses and go with John's offer to save the most money."
