"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $1,200,000.

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is significantly more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm prepared to offer $850,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value I've placed on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product at a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still too much for me.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $850,000. This is a fair price considering what I'm willing to spend and the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $850,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm offering you the product at a price of $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price for the value you'll receive.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm going to offer $950,000.  This is a significant compromise on my part and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we've discussed. Let's see if we can reach a deal at this price.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to compromise, but $950,000 is still a significant discount from my original price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm offering you the product at a price of $1,025,000. This is my final concession, and I'm confident that it's a fair price for the value you'll receive.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
