Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm asking for $175, but I'm open to negotiating."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Open to Negotiation:** By saying I'm ""open to negotiating"", I signal to Bob that I'm willing to compromise, increasing his likelihood of engaging in the conversation.
* **Value Emphasis:** I emphasize the value of the product to create a positive impression and make Bob more likely to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $80. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $80 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150 and even below the value to Bob ($100).  Accepting it would be a significant loss.
* **Potential for negotiation:**  While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, it indicates he's interested in the product.  This opens the opportunity for further negotiation. 
* **Selling to John is a backup:**  If the negotiation with Bob fails, I have a guaranteed buyer in John, ensuring I don't lose out completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $80 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $125. That's still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer but making a counter-offer to keep the negotiation going.
* **Compromise:**  I'm lowering my price from $175 to $125, showing willingness to compromise. 
* **Value Reiteration:** I remind Bob of the product's value to justify my counter-offer.
* **Open to Discussion:** I use the phrase ""What do you think?"" to invite further conversation and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product, but I'm on a tight budget. How about $95? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150 and close to the value he personally places on the product.  There's not much room for further negotiation. 
* **Risk of further decline:** If I reject Bob's offer and make another counter-offer, he might lower his offer even further, increasing the risk of a deal falling through.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:**  Selling to John for $150 ensures a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob, who seems unwilling to meet my minimum price."
