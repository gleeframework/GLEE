Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a great deal to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. My starting price is $1,200,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay a price closer to its market value. How about we try something around $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  While $900,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This would still leave us both with a good profit.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,000,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for something a bit lower. Would you consider $950,000? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not where I want to be. I believe there's still room to negotiate a higher price, and I'm willing to continue the discussion with Bob in hopes of a more favorable outcome."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $950,000 just isn't enough for me to part with this valuable product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about we settle on $975,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 975000}
