Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $13,500. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 13500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Knowing Bob values the product at $15,000, we want to get as close to that price as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $13,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a bit, while still ensuring Alice gets a significantly higher price than John's offer.
* **First-Mover Advantage:** Highlighting that this is an exclusive offer before a public listing can incentivize Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the higher price."
