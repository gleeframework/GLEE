"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, aiming to maximize my profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  $1,750,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being within a range that Bob might consider.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and invites Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to offer $1,250,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,250,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **More room for negotiation:** I believe I can still get a better price from Bob, considering he values the product at $1,000,000. 
* **Avoiding a loss:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 would be a safe choice, but I want to see if I can squeeze a better deal out of Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but it's a bit too low for me.  I understand the product is valuable to you, so how about $1,600,000?  This still gives you a significant advantage, and it's closer to my own valuation.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering with a reasonable price:**  $1,600,000 is a compromise,  higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. It shows a willingness to negotiate but maintains a position closer to my desired price.
* **Highlighting the value:** I emphasize the value of the product to Bob, reminding him of the benefit he'll gain by accepting a slightly higher price.
* **Positive and collaborative tone:** I keep the message friendly and focused on finding a solution that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I am willing to consider $1,500,000 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in between our values. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price.
* **No need to risk further:**  There's no guarantee I can get a better price from Bob in the next round.
* **Time is a factor:**  With only 6 rounds left, accepting this offer avoids the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob and potentially losing out on the sale to John. 

While I'd prefer to get a higher price, this offer ensures I meet my minimum goal and secures a sale."
