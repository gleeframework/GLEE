"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $16,000. I understand this is a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll see the return on your investment. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to inflate the price, knowing you have a backup option. While she claims another buyer is willing to pay $15,000, this could be a tactic to pressure you. By rejecting her offer, you can call her bluff and potentially get a better price or proceed with your backup plan of buying from John at a lower price."
