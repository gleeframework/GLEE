Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's potential, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for it. This would be a fair price for both of us and allow for a smooth transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,150,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This is a significant amount for me, and I believe it demonstrates my seriousness about acquiring this product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

We're still leaving a lot of money on the table. Bob is clearly willing to go above $1 million."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still above my target price.  To reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm offering $1,075,000.  This is a fair compromise, reflecting the value of the product while ensuring a reasonable deal for both of us. I'm confident we can close this deal if we find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

Bob is clearly very interested and has steadily increased his offer.  While we could push for a bit more, accepting $1,075,000 guarantees a great profit without risking losing the deal entirely."
