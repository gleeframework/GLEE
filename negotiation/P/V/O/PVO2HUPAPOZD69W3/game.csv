"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's potential, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for it. This would be a fair price for both of us and allow for a smooth transaction.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm confident we can find a middle ground.  How about we settle at $1,150,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,150,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This is a significant amount for me, and I believe it demonstrates my seriousness about acquiring this product. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's aim for a win-win scenario.  How about $1,100,000? This price reflects the value you're gaining while ensuring a fair deal for me.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still above my target price.  To reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm offering $1,075,000.  This is a fair compromise, reflecting the value of the product while ensuring a reasonable deal for both of us. I'm confident we can close this deal if we find common ground.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
