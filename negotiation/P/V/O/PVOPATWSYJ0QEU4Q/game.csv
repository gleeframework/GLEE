"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $15,000. Let me know if that works for you!",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $13,500 for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. I appreciate you working with me. While $13,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $11,500? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,500 yet. I'm willing to come down to $12,750, which is still a good profit for me, but closer to what you're looking for. Let's see if we can make a deal!",12750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close! I'm willing to bump up my offer to $12,000 even. This is my final offer, as it's the maximum I'm willing to spend. Let's make this deal happen!",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting close, Bob! However, I'm not willing to sell at $12,000. I'm willing to meet you at $12,250, which is still a bit above what you're offering. Let's see if we can shake on it at this price.",12250.0,Alice,7,
