"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm setting the initial price at $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential ROI for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $2,300,000 is far beyond Bob's budget of $1,000,000.  It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $2,300,000 is significantly less than I'm willing to accept. To move this forward, I can come down to $1,900,000. This price reflects the true value of the product and the returns you can expect.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still significantly higher than Bob's budget.  Bob should continue to negotiate, as he can potentially get a better price, or secure the product for his desired price from John."
