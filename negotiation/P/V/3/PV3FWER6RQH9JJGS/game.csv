"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $1,100,000 for this product.  Let's find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to come down, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll offer $950,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still below my minimum. I'm confident in the value of this product, and I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000. This reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll offer $975,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",975000.0,Bob,6,
