"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price of $18,000. I think it's a great value, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested, but only if we can agree on a price closer to $10,000. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $14,000, which is the lowest I can go. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle. While $14,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. Could you do $12,000? I think that would be a fair compromise.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in this product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I can do $13,500. That's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,500 is still pushing my budget. I can offer a final price of $12,500. If that doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",12500.0,Bob,6,
