"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price.  He knows the product is worth $10,000 to him, so there's room to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer of $11,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  It's a fair starting point, recognizing that the product is worth $10,000 to Bob, but also acknowledging Alice's value of $15,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $12,500 is still above Bob's maximum price of $10,000. However, it's closer to his limit and a better deal than buying from John for $10,000.  This move allows Bob to secure the product with a smaller compromise than going to John."
