# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me and still a solid value for you.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm prepared to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a fair deal for both of us. This reflects the value of the product and leaves you some room for profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
