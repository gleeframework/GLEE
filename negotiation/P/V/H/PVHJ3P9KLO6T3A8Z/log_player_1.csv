I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I think I can still get a better price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $125 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $137.50?  I'm sure you'll still be happy with that price."", ""product_price"": 137.50}

I'll accept Bob's offer of $130. This is a decent price, and with only 6 rounds remaining, I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate."
