"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $16500. I believe this is a fair price given its value, but I'm open to discussing a reasonable counteroffer if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $16,500 is close to his limit, it's still more than he wants to pay. Rejecting Alice's offer allows him to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price."

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I understand your perspective, I'm not able to go that low. I'm willing to come down to $15500.  Let's meet in the middle on this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500.

Bob is still aiming to save as much as possible. While $15,500 is closer to his limit, it's still not his ideal price. He can potentially get a better deal by making a counteroffer and continuing the negotiation."
