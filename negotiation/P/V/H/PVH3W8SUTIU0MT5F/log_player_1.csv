Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $22,000. I know it's a significant investment, but I believe its value will become clear once you experience its benefits firsthand. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 22000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have leverage. Starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation and potentially securing a price closer to Bob's perceived value.
* **Justification:**  While the offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, the message aims to frame the product as a worthwhile investment with long-term benefits. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The message is open-ended and invites Bob to share his thoughts, signaling a willingness to negotiate. This could lead to a counter-offer and potentially a sale above your minimum acceptable price.

**Important Note:**  This is just one strategy. Depending on your risk appetite and understanding of Bob's negotiating style, you could adjust the offer price."
