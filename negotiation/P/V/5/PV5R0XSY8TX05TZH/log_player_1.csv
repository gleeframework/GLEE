Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($1,000,000) as possible while still ensuring a profit above John's offer ($1,200,000). 
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning other interested parties (even if John is the only other one) creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly."
