"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be open to $75? ",75.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand that $75 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $82. What do you think?",82.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $82 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we split the difference and go with $80? That way we can both be happy with the deal.",80.0,Bob,4,
