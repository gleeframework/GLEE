"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",13000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $11,500? That's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $11,250? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I really need to stay within my budget.",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $11,250 is still a bit lower than where I need to be. I'm willing to compromise a little more, how about $11,400?  This is a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price. Let's make this happen!",11400.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,400 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,500, but I think that's the maximum I can afford. Can you meet me at $11,500 or am I going to have to look elsewhere?",11500.0,Bob,6,
