"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to discuss the sale of this product with you.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at $2,200,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and potential for a significant return on your investment."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with an ambitious but not entirely unreasonable offer. This gives room to negotiate downwards while still aiming for a price significantly above both your minimum and Bob's perceived value. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value"" and ""potential"" aims to shift Bob's focus from the price tag to the potential benefits, justifying the high initial offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The large difference between the offered price and Bob's perceived value leaves ample room for negotiation over the subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  while I appreciate your offer,  $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Given the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the potential of this product.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price and John's standing offer. Rejecting this offer allows you to:

* **Gauge Bob's Seriousness:**  Seeing how much you're willing to budge will give you a better understanding of his negotiation style and how badly he wants the product.
* **Maintain a Strong Position:** Accepting such a low offer early on weakens your negotiating position and makes it harder to push for a better price.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  The guaranteed offer from John provides a valuable safety net, allowing you to negotiate more confidently with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value this product brings is truly exceptional and has the potential to generate substantial returns for your business.  I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000. This offer reflects my best effort to find a mutually beneficial agreement."", 
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Gradual Concession:** Lowering the price by $250,000 shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming high.  
* **Highlighting Potential Returns:** The message reinforces the product's value proposition, emphasizing the long-term benefits for Bob's business. This helps justify the still-high asking price.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer helps assess Bob's flexibility and willingness to move closer to your desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer, but $1,950,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm prepared to pay $1,400,000, which I believe is a reasonable price considering the potential benefits.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Bob increased his offer by only $100,000, indicating he might be a tough negotiator. At this pace, reaching an agreeable price within the remaining rounds seems unlikely.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:** You have a guaranteed offer for $1,500,000 from John. This gives you leverage to push Bob closer to your minimum acceptable price.
* **Time Constraint:**  With only six rounds remaining, it's becoming riskier to continue negotiating with Bob, especially if his concessions remain small."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true value of this product and the significant returns it can generate. To be candid, I have another buyer ready to purchase at a higher price.  I'm offering you a final opportunity to secure this deal at $1,700,000. This is my best and final offer."", 
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  The message strikes a balance between firmness and a willingness to compromise. 
* **Introducing Competition:**  Mentioning ""another buyer"" introduces an element of scarcity and urgency, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly.
* **Final Offer Tactic:** Presenting this as your ""best and final offer"" puts the ball in Bob's court and signals that further negotiation might be futile.  This can push him to make a decision.
* **Strategic Concession:** The price drop to $1,700,000 is substantial, showing flexibility, but still leaves a significant gap for Bob to close if he wants the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I acknowledge the potential of this product,  $1,700,000  remains beyond my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $1,500,000, which I believe is a fair price, considering the potential benefits and my own financial constraints.  This is my final offer,  and I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Matching Offers:** Bob's final offer of $1,500,000 matches John's standing offer. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  While you could try to push Bob further in the remaining rounds, there's no guarantee he'll budge from his ""final offer."" Accepting now avoids the risk of losing both offers and secures the sale immediately. 
* **Relationship Building:** Accepting Bob's final offer could be seen as a gesture of goodwill, potentially fostering a positive future business relationship."
