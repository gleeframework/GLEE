Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a price that is higher than what the product is worth to him, but still lower than what I'd get from John. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, while still ensuring I get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to settle for a price that's so low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $100. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still a price that I'm comfortable with. Hopefully, this will be enough to convince Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is too low for me to accept. I'm not going to continue negotiating with him.  It's more profitable for me to sell the product to John for $120."
