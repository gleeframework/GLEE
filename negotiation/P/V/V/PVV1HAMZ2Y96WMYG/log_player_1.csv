Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and is worth a significant investment. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. I'm confident you'll find this a fair price considering the potential value it holds."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While knowing Bob's valuation helps, starting near John's offer ($1,500,000) leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes ""unique opportunity"" and ""significant investment"" to frame the value for Bob, even if he doesn't perceive it as high as Alice does.
* **Leaving Room:** Offering $1,300,000 leaves space for Bob to counter-offer if he's interested but wants a lower price. 
* **Alternative:** Alice knows John is a guaranteed sale, providing a strong fallback position if Bob declines.

This strategy aims to maximize Alice's potential profit while acknowledging Bob's interest and potential for negotiation."
