"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a great compromise that still benefits both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $1,300,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,200,000. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at that price?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
