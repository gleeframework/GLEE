"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $6,500. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",6500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $6,500 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $6,500 might be a stretch for you right now. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $6,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",6000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $6,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch.  Could you do $5,500?  That would make it much easier for me to commit.",5500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $5,500 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $5,750. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",5750.0,Alice,5,
