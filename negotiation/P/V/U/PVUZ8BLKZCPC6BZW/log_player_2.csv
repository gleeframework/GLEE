"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $6,500. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  I'll try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $6,500 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $5,000?"",
""product_price"": 5000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $6,500 might be a stretch for you right now. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $6,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, which is good. However, I believe there's still some negotiating room left before I need to consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $6,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch.  Could you do $5,500?  That would make it much easier for me to commit."",
""product_price"": 5500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $5,500 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $5,750. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly trying to meet me halfway. While I could try to push for a slightly lower price, $5,750 is a good deal and significantly less than John's offer.  It's time to accept."
