Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is higher than Bob's valuation but leaves some room for bargaining.  It also shows you're willing to negotiate, but you're confident in the value of your product.  

I'll be ready to respond to Bob's counteroffer, or if he rejects,  I'll be able to make a new counteroffer based on his response."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum price, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price slightly to show willingness to negotiate, but I'm still holding firm above Bob's offer. This demonstrates my desire to come to a mutually agreeable price, while also emphasizing the value of my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still too far below my minimum price. I don't want to risk continuing the negotiation and ending up with a deal that doesn't meet my minimum requirements.  Selling to John guarantees I get the price I need."
