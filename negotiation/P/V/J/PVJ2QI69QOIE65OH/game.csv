"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $150 to me, but I understand its value might be different for you. Let's start with a fair price. How about $120?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you acknowledging the value difference. However, $120 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $105.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",105.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. Based on our discussion, I would like to propose a price of $110 for the product. This allows us to both feel satisfied with the transaction.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm comfortable with my previous offer of $105. If you're not willing to meet me there, I might have to consider other options.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. Considering our past discussions and your valuation of the product, I am willing to lower the price to $107. This still allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while ensuring you get a fair deal.",107.0,Alice,5,
