Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you something truly unique that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its unique nature and my understanding of your potential use for it, I'm offering it at $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price reflecting its significant value."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, securing a deal with Bob has the potential to earn you more.
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting with a price slightly below your guaranteed sale provides room for negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **Value Justification:** Highlighting the product's ""unique nature"" and Bob's potential use helps justify the high price, potentially making it more palatable.

This approach aims to strike a balance between a high asking price and the possibility of a quick, profitable sale to Bob."
