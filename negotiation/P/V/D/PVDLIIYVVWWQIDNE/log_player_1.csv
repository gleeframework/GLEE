{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $12,000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 14000}

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can reach a more fair price. Considering the value of the product, I would like to propose a price of $11,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price.  $11,000 is too low for me, even though I'm aware I can always sell to John for $12,000.  I think I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to accept $12,500 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the item for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, but I still believe we can come to an agreement closer to my initial proposal. How about we aim for $12,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for me, as Bob is offering my minimum price.  There's no point in risking a lower offer from Bob in the next round, or selling to John at the same price."
