Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $115."", ""product_price"": 115}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```
I think taking the $110 is a good outcome.  While I could push for more, there's no guarantee Bob will go higher, and I'd risk losing the sale altogether.
