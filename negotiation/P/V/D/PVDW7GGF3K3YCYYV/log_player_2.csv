"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you our premium product for $11,500. This is a special opportunity tailored to your needs, considering the value you see in it. Please let me know if this offer meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is better than Alice's original asking price, Bob can still potentially get a better deal. By rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer, Bob has the opportunity to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value you place on the product, I propose a price of $11,000. This allows us to meet somewhere in the middle while still ensuring a fair return for our product. I hope this proposal works for you.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's maximum budget is $10,000. While Alice has come down from her initial offer, it's still above Bob's limit.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to secure the product from John for his target price rather than risk further negotiation with Alice.  There's no guarantee Alice will come down any further, and Bob could end up paying more than his desired amount."
