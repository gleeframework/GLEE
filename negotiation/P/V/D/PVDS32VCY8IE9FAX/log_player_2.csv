Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $115. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $125? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
