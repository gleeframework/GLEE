"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  While I think your product is great,  $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it. What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $13,000 is still a little lower than I'd like. How about $13,500? That would be a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen!",13500.0,Alice,3,
