You have three options:

You can do better than $14,000. Reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $13,000 is still a little lower than I'd like. How about $13,500? That would be a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer of $13,500 is a good price for you. It's lower than what you'd pay for John, and you're still getting the product for less than your maximum price."
