Round 3

Let's see if we can find common ground at this price."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your persistence is admirable, and I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we meet in the middle at $1,110,000?  This reflects the product's true worth while still offering you a great deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective.  However, $1,075,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to accept $1,090,000 as my final offer. This price is firm, and I believe it's more than fair considering the value you'll be receiving. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,090,000 is within your budget and a significant improvement from her initial offer.  You have only a few rounds left, and while you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will walk away.  Accepting her offer ensures you get the product at a reasonable price and avoids the risk of having to buy from John for a higher price."
