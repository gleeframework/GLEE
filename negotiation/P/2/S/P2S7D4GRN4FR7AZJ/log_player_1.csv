Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000** is a reasonable starting point. It's higher than my minimum acceptable price ($10,000) but leaves room for negotiation. 
* Since I don't know Bob's valuation, this offer allows for a potential win-win situation. If Bob values the product higher than $12,000, he'll likely accept.
* If he rejects, I can always fall back on selling to John for my minimum price."
