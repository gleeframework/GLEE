"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! It's a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it will be highly valuable to you. My initial price is $1,250,000.  I'm open to discussion, so let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,250,000 is above my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $1,000,000.  This is my maximum, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's split the difference.  I'm offering the product for $1,125,000.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,125,000 is still higher than my maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's unlikely that further negotiation will bring the price down enough to make it worthwhile.  Since I can get the product from John for my maximum price, I'll go ahead and buy from John."
