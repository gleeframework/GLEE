"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a product that's worth a great deal to you. I understand it holds a value of $1000000 to you, and I'm confident it would be a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000, which represents a significant gain for both of us. This is a limited-time offer, as I have another interested party ready to purchase it for $800000. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is selling the product for $900,000, while John would sell it for $1,000,000.
* **Saving money is the goal:** Accepting Alice's offer saves you $100,000 compared to buying from John. 

Even though the product is worth $1,000,000 to you,  saving $100,000 is a significant gain."
