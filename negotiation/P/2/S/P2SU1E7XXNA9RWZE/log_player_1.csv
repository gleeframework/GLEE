Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That starting price is a little high for me. I'm more comfortable in the $600,000 range. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a big gap for me. To be honest, I'm working with a budget closer to  $700,000. Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is still very far from a reasonable price point.  It's important to show I'm willing to negotiate, but not at the cost of devaluing the product.  I'll make another counteroffer to try and find a middle ground."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. To meet somewhere in the middle, I'm proposing $1,700,000.  This reflects a significant compromise on my end while still recognizing its worth."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. It seems like we're getting closer.  How about $800,000?  That's the absolute top of my budget, but I'm ready to close the deal today if you're agreeable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has now hit his maximum budget, which is still far below my minimum acceptable price. There's no indication he'll go any higher, and further negotiation is unlikely to bridge the gap.  It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
