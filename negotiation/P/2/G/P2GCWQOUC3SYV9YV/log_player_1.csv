{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $18,000. It's a great deal, but I'm willing to negotiate. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum of $12,000 to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Enthusiastic Tone:** Using a positive and enthusiastic tone encourages Bob to engage and consider the offer seriously.
* **Open to Negotiation:** Explicitly stating that I'm willing to negotiate shows flexibility and makes Bob feel like he has some control. 

This approach aims to:

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting high gives me more room to negotiate downwards while still achieving a satisfactory price.
* **Engage Bob:** A positive and open approach is more likely to encourage Bob to engage in a negotiation rather than simply rejecting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $15000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is lower than my minimum:** While $15,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price. There's a chance Bob might be willing to pay closer to my initial price if he truly values the product.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain control of the negotiation and keep the opportunity open for a more profitable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,500, which is a significant drop from my original price.  It reflects my desire to make this deal work, but I also need to ensure I get a fair value for my product.  Let me know if you're interested in this compromise."", ""product_price"": 16500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm counteroffering with a price halfway between my original asking price ($18,000) and Bob's offer ($15,000). This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price above my minimum.
* **Highlighting the compromise:** I emphasize that this is a ""significant drop"" from my original price to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Maintaining a firm stance:** While offering a lower price, I still state that it needs to be ""a fair value for my product"" to avoid appearing desperate or easily swayed.
* **Open-ended question:** I end with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $14500 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While I'm open to negotiation, Bob's offer of $14,500 is now below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Limited potential for improvement:**  I've already lowered my price twice, and it's unlikely Bob will increase his offer significantly.
* **Guaranteed sale:**  Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees me a sale at my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't lose out on potential profit.

The risk of continuing the negotiation is that Bob might refuse to increase his offer further, leading to a stalemate and a wasted opportunity to sell the product. Selling to John provides a reliable and immediate outcome."
