"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a deal. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to come down to $110, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $107.50. Can you consider that?",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we may not be able to reach an agreement. While I appreciate your continued negotiation, $107.50 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $109, but that's my final offer.",109.0,Alice,5,
