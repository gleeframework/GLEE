"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Considering your cost and my value for the product, I'm willing to pay $950,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this quickly.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I understand the value this product holds for you, and I'm confident we can find a middle ground.  How about $1,100,000?  This price reflects both our needs and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1,025,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us and allows us to reach a quick agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
