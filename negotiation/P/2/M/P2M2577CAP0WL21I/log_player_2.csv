"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, we believe it would be fair to propose a price of $14,000 for this valuable item. We understand its worth to you is $15,000, and we aim to find a mutually beneficial solution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. There's plenty of room for negotiation before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation strategy often involves starting with a lower counteroffer than your ideal price to allow room for bargaining.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is respectful but clearly indicates the initial offer is unacceptable. 
* **Targeting a Fair Price:** Aiming for $11,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly below both Alice's asking price and John's alternative."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. After reviewing your offer, we've decided to counter with a price of $12,500. We hope this aligns better with your budget while still reflecting the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress, But Not Enough:** Alice moved down in price, which is positive. However, the gap between her offer ($12,500) and a potentially agreeable price (around $11,000) is still significant. 
* **Negotiation Leverage:** It's still early in the negotiation, and we have time to try for a better price before considering John's less favorable option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $12,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $11,500 to make this work.  What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer shows willingness to compromise by moving closer to Alice's price.
* **Maintaining a Goal:**  We're holding firm around the $11,500 mark, still leaving room for negotiation while aiming for a significant saving.
* **Positive Tone:** The language continues to be polite and collaborative, encouraging Alice to continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering your feedback, we're willing to adjust our price to $12,000. This reflects a compromise that maintains the value of the product while being more accessible to your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Slowing Progress:**  While Alice is moving in the right direction, her concessions are getting smaller ($500 this round versus $1,000 in the previous round).  
* **Still Above Target:** $12,000 is still a significant amount above our desired price range.
* **Time for Leverage:** With more than half the rounds remaining, it's worth pushing a little harder to see if we can get closer to $11,500."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the movement. How about we meet in the middle at $11,750? That feels like a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 11750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** Offering $11,750 is a smaller concession than our previous move, signaling we're nearing our bottom line.
* **""Meet in the Middle"":** This framing makes the offer seem more appealing and like a win-win. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** While still polite, we're getting closer to John's alternative, and the tone subtly implies time is a factor."
