"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has immense value and I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $800,000. I think this is a fair starting point considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $800,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000. This is a fair price considering your value for the product and my own budget.  What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to accept $700,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm offering $800,000. This price is a fair reflection of both our valuations and leaves room for us to both walk away satisfied.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $850,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you and the market demand. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to maintain a reasonable margin. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
