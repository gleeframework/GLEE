"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has immense value and I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $800,000. I think this is a fair starting point considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $800,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. It's better to try and get a lower price, especially since I have a fallback option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $800,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000. This is a fair price considering your value for the product and my own budget.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to accept $700,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is closer to my desired price, I still think I can get a better deal. I'm willing to negotiate further and see if I can reach a price closer to $700,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm offering $800,000. This price is a fair reflection of both our valuations and leaves room for us to both walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $850,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you and the market demand. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to maintain a reasonable margin. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $850,000 is getting closer to my ideal price. While I would prefer to pay less,  it's getting risky to keep rejecting offers.  I've already wasted 4 rounds and we're halfway through the negotiation process. Accepting this offer will allow me to secure the product for a price that's still within my budget, and I can avoid the risk of having to buy from John at a much higher price."
