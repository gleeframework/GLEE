"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a great investment. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $17,000 is far above my maximum budget of $10,000. 
* There's no point in accepting this offer, as I can get the product from John for a much lower price.
* I'll reject Alice's offer and see if I can negotiate a better price in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $17,000 is simply out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $10,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This price still gives me a decent return and allows for some room for negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* While Alice's offer of $13,500 is closer to my budget, it's still above my desired price point of $10,000. 
* I have 7 rounds left, and I'm willing to continue negotiating. 
* I'm confident that I can get a better deal by rejecting her offer and sending a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $12,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while still staying within my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not able to go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $12,750? It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to continue negotiations with you. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* While Alice's offer of $12,750 is getting closer to my budget, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.
* I've already rejected her previous offer, so she's showing some flexibility.
* I have 5 rounds left, so I believe I can continue negotiating and hopefully secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility.  I'm willing to go up to $11,500, but that's my absolute top limit. This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing you to get a reasonable price and me to get a great product within my budget.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're at your limit, but $11,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,125. This allows for a decent profit for me, while still offering a fair deal for you. Let's close this deal, I'm confident we can both be happy with this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* While Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate and is getting closer to my budget, $12,125 is still significantly higher than my desired price of $10,000.
* I have only 3 rounds left, and it's unlikely I'll be able to get Alice down to my desired price point in such a short timeframe.
* John is offering the product at my desired price, which guarantees I won't overspend.

Given these factors, it's more beneficial for me to buy the product from John and secure a deal that meets my budget constraints."
