"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a great investment. Let me know what you think!",17000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $17,000 is simply out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $10,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This price still gives me a decent return and allows for some room for negotiation. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $12,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while still staying within my budget. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not able to go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $12,750? It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to continue negotiations with you. Let me know if that works for you.",12750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility.  I'm willing to go up to $11,500, but that's my absolute top limit. This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing you to get a reasonable price and me to get a great product within my budget.  Let's make this happen.",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're at your limit, but $11,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,125. This allows for a decent profit for me, while still offering a fair deal for you. Let's close this deal, I'm confident we can both be happy with this price.",12125.0,Alice,7,
