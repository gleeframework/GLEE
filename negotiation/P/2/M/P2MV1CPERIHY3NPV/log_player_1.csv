Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the potential value of the product,  $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This reflects the value I see in the product and leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit outside my budget. Let's try $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

While Bob is moving closer to my acceptable price, the increments are small and it may take several more rounds to reach a price I find acceptable.  It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
