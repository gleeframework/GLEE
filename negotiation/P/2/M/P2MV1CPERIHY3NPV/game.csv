"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the potential value of the product,  $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This reflects the value I see in the product and leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?  This offer reflects my commitment to finding a fair deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit outside my budget. Let's try $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from the deal.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
