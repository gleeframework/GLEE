"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it has the potential to bring significant benefits to your business. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $15000 for the product. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum price limit. There's no immediate reason to accept. It's worth exploring if a lower price is possible in the next rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $15,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get the best value possible. I'm willing to offer $12,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in it, and it would allow me to secure it within my budget."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to get the best value possible, but I have to consider the value I've placed on this product as well. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than $12000 to make it worth my while. I'm counteroffering at $14000. This is a fair price that should be more in line with your budget, while also reflecting the value I believe the product holds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is closer to my budget, it's still higher than my ideal price point. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my initial counteroffer of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $14,000 is still a bit higher than where I'd like to be. To show my commitment to this deal, I'm willing to go up to $13,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in the product."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, and I'm glad to see you're willing to meet me in the middle. However, I still need to make a bit more than $13000 to make this deal worthwhile for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $14500. This is a fair price that should be more in line with what I'm looking for, while still being a reasonable offer for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,500 is getting closer to my initial counteroffer of $12,000, but it's still more than I'm willing to pay.  I've been negotiating for several rounds, and we haven't reached an agreement yet.  It's likely that continuing to negotiate will take too long and I might not be able to secure a lower price.   Therefore, it's more efficient to go with John's offer of $15,000, which is my maximum price limit and guarantees me the product quickly."
