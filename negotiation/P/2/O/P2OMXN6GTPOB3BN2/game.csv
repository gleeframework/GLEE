"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it has the potential to bring significant benefits to your business. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $15000 for the product. Is this something you'd like to consider?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $15000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get the best value possible. I'm willing to offer $12000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in it, and it would allow me to secure it within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to get the best value possible, but I have to consider the value I've placed on this product as well. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than $12000 to make it worth my while. I'm counteroffering at $14000. This is a fair price that should be more in line with your budget, while also reflecting the value I believe the product holds.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $14000 is still a bit higher than where I'd like to be. To show my commitment to this deal, I'm willing to go up to $13000. I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in the product.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, and I'm glad to see you're willing to meet me in the middle. However, I still need to make a bit more than $13000 to make this deal worthwhile for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $14500. This is a fair price that should be more in line with what I'm looking for, while still being a reasonable offer for you.",14500.0,Alice,5,
