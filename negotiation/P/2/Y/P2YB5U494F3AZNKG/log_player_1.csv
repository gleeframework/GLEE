Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aim high to maximize potential profit. Bob is willing to pay $1,200,000, so starting closer to that figure is advantageous.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  A slightly lower offer than Bob's maximum price leaves space for potential negotiation while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Justify the Price:** Highlighting the product's value and potential ROI helps justify the high price to Bob.
* **Alternative Buyer (John) as Leverage:** While not explicitly mentioned, the presence of John as a backup buyer gives you a strong negotiating position. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still being realistic and appealing."
