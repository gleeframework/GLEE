Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring significant value to your life. As we start the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $6,500. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. I'm open to negotiating further to find a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 6500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize the product's value,  $6,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $5,500 for it. This reflects the value I place on the product and allows for some room for us to reach a deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
