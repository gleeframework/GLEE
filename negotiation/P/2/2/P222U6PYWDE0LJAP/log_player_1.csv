"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 200} 
 
I'm starting with a price of $200, leaving room for negotiation but ensuring I get more than my minimum.  I'll see how Bob responds and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$120 is significantly less than my minimum value of $150. I'm not willing to sell at such a low price, especially since I have the option of selling to John for a higher price. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $175. This is a significant increase from his offer, but it's still lower than my initial offer, showing flexibility while ensuring I get closer to my desired value.  Let's see if this gets us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $150 is my minimum acceptable price, and it's the same price I can get from John.  There's no reason to continue negotiating, so I'll accept Bob's offer."
