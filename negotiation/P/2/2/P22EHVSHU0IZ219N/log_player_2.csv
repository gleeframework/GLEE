"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1400000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum value:** You're willing to pay up to $1,500,000, and Alice is asking for $1,400,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation:** You can likely get a better price by counter-offering. 
* **Buying from John is a backup:** You have a fallback option if negotiations fail. 

By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you open the door for potentially getting a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Lowering the price significantly:** This shows Alice you're serious about negotiating and willing to pay a fair price, but not her asking price.
* **Leaving room for compromise:** You're still $200,000 below Alice's minimum value, so there's room for her to counter.
* **Setting a clear target:** $1,300,000 is a good starting point for a counteroffer, as it's within your budget and leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1300000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives you a good opportunity. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now within your budget:**  You're willing to pay up to $1,500,000, and Alice is offering the product for $1,350,000.
* **Good deal for both sides:** This price is likely close to Alice's minimum acceptable value and within your budget, ensuring a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Risk of going further:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate, potentially pushing you closer to your maximum budget or forcing you to buy from John.

Accepting Alice's offer at $1,350,000 secures the product at a good price and avoids potential complications with further negotiation."
