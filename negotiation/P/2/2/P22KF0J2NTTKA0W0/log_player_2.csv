"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product.  It's valued at $1,000,000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset.  My starting price is $950,000.  I'm open to discussing a mutually agreeable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  While it's better than John's price, there's definitely room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $850,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a great deal for you given the product's value.  Let's work towards a win-win situation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $900,000, which is still a good deal for Bob. While Bob could continue negotiating, the risk is that Alice might reject further offers, and he might end up having to buy from John for $1,000,000.  Accepting Alice's offer is the most pragmatic choice, securing a price lower than John's and within Bob's budget."
