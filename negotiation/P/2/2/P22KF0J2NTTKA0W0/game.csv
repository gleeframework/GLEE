"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product.  It's valued at $1,000,000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset.  My starting price is $950,000.  I'm open to discussing a mutually agreeable price.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $850,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a great deal for you given the product's value.  Let's work towards a win-win situation.",900000.0,Alice,3,
