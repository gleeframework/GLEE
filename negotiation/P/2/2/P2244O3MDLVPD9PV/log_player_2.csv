(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her original value, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if Bob can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a price that is within his budget while also showing Alice that he is serious about buying the product. A counteroffer of $900,000 is a good starting point. It's a significant drop from Alice's offer, but still leaves room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still above Bob's budget. Even though it's a lower price than before, there's still room to negotiate. Bob should try to get closer to his $800,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of gradually moving towards his target price. $950,000 is a compromise between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer. This shows Alice that he's willing to negotiate but also has a firm limit in mind."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's budget, $1,025,000 is still too high.  Bob should continue to negotiate and push for a lower price.  He's only $25,000 away from his limit, so there's still room for Alice to come down a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a final push to get closer to his budget while still showing Alice that he is willing to meet her halfway. $975,000 is a strong counteroffer that demonstrates Bob's determination to close the deal without exceeding his limit.  This price is also closer to Alice's last offer, showing that he's willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,015,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,015,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price but still hasn't come down enough.  The negotiation is getting tiring, and Bob is now only $15,000 away from his limit.  This makes it unlikely that Alice will meet his price, and further negotiation could drag on. It's more efficient for Bob to buy the product from John at the guaranteed price of $800,000."
