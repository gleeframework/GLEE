"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that's worth $1,500,000 to you. It's a rare chance to acquire something truly valuable.  I'm willing to let it go for $1,550,000. This is a price that allows you to make a great return on your investment while giving me a fair profit.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  While she claims it's a ""great return on investment,"" it's not for you since you're aiming to stay within your budget. You can get the same product from John for your maximum price."
