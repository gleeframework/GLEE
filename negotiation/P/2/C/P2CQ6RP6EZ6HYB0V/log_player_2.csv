Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, which still gives you a significant value for the product. Let's find common ground.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll gain. Let's see if we can find a solution.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $975,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.

It's time to cut bait and go with John.  Alice is likely to keep negotiating down slowly, but it's unlikely she'll go below $1,000,000. You're better off securing the deal with John at your target price."
