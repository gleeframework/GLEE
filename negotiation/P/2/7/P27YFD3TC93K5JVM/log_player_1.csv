{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer allows me to earn a decent profit while still being potentially attractive to Bob. It's a good balance between maximizing my earnings and increasing the chances of Bob accepting the offer. 

Here's why:

* **My Value:**  The product is worth $12,000 to me, so anything above that is a win.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $8,000 to Bob. This means he's willing to pay up to that amount, so a price of $10,000 is within his range, giving him a potential $2,000 in savings. 
* **John's Value:**  John will pay $12,000, so I have a fallback option if Bob rejects. This gives me some negotiation leverage. 

By offering $10,000, I'm aiming to secure a sale with Bob while ensuring I still get a good price."
