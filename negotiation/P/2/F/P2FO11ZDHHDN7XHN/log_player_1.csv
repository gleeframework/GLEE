Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase my product. Given its value and the demand I'm seeing, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can reach a more reasonable agreement. I am willing to pay $15,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. While I value your interest, I'm looking for something closer to my initial offer. Would you be willing to consider $18,000?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still feel that $15,000 would be a fair price for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Explanation:  Bob is holding firm at $15,000, which is his maximum perceived value.  It's unlikely further negotiation will get me a better price from him. Since John is offering $15,000, there's no benefit to continuing with Bob."
