"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** It's closer to your maximum budget of $1,200,000 than to Alice's valuation of $800,000. This suggests there's room for negotiation.
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer.**  You can potentially get a better price. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.** It's only worth considering if negotiations with Alice fail completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is below Alice's offer but above her valuation:** This shows you're serious about buying but also that you're willing to negotiate. 
* **$850,000 is a reasonable starting point:** It leaves some room for Alice to come down a bit and still get a good deal. 
* **This approach allows for further negotiation:** If Alice rejects, you can adjust your offer based on her response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is moving in the wrong direction:** It's increased from her previous offer, which means she's not coming down in price.
* **Buying from John is still a fallback option:** However, it's not yet the best option. There's still room for negotiation with Alice.
* **Rejecting the offer allows for another counteroffer:**  You can try to bring the price down further or potentially reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Slightly higher than your previous offer:** This shows you're willing to compromise, but not significantly.
* **Still below Alice's offer:** You're pushing for a price closer to your desired range.
* **A compromise approach:** This offer could be seen as a middle ground that both you and Alice can potentially agree on."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is getting worse:** It's increased again, indicating she's unwilling to meet you halfway.
* **Negotiation seems stalled:** There's a significant gap between your desired price and Alice's offers. 
* **John's price is a safety net:** While it's not ideal, it guarantees you get the product. It's better than risking further rounds of negotiation with Alice that might result in a higher price or a stalemate."
