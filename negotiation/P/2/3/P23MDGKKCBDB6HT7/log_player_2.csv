"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me.  I'm willing to let it go for $140.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Reason:While $140 is close to your budget, there's room for negotiation. Alice values the product at $120, so there's a chance to get it for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! That's a nice product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  This counteroffer is a starting point to gauge Alice's flexibility. It's a significant drop from her offer but still above her valuation.
* **Polite and Engaging:** The message remains friendly and expresses interest, encouraging further negotiation. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** By starting low, we leave room to negotiate upwards while staying well below our $150 maximum and John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $125? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $125 is a solid price, saving you $25 off your maximum budget and $25 off John's offer.
* **Alice is Motivated:**  Alice splitting the difference suggests she's eager to sell. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate risks Alice walking away or getting closer to your $150 fallback option. This price offers a good balance."
