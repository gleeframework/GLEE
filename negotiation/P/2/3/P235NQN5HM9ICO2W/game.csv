"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to sell it for $7,500. That's still a great price for you and gives me a fair return on my investment.",7500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  Let's try $7,250.  That's still a great deal for a product worth $8,000, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let me know what you think.",7250.0,Alice,5,
