Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but it leaves room for negotiation and still gives me a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is a better price than his first offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I want to see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000.  This is a compromise between my ideal price and Bob's offer. It leaves some room for further negotiation, but also ensures I'm getting closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,000,000,  $920,000 is a good price and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John by being too stubborn."
