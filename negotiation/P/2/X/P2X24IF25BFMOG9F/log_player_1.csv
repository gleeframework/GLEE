Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be a valuable asset to you.  Given its unique features and quality, I'm offering it at $20,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product. Let me know if this is something we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your reply. I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This reflects the value it would bring you while still acknowledging its worth."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. While I understand the value of the product, I'm still not able to meet at $17,000. I'm willing to go up to $12,000. Let me know if this is feasible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is moving closer to a more reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach the $15,000 mark I need. It's better to take the guaranteed offer from John than risk getting stuck in a protracted negotiation with Bob."
