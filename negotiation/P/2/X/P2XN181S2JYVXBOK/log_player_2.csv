Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $180 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. How about we meet in the middle at $120? I'm willing to make a concession, but I need to make a profit.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $95. I'm willing to go a bit lower than my previous offer, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $110? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but it's closer to my minimum price.

It's unlikely Alice will go below $100, and I'm better off securing the product at my target price."
