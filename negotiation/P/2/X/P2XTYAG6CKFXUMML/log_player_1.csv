Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're asking for more than your minimum of $80.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob is likely to counteroffer, and this gives you room to bargain. 
* **It's a reasonable price for Bob:** Bob values the product at $100, so $95 is still a good deal for him. 

By setting a high initial price, you can potentially maximize your profit while still leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Here's why:

* **Potential for Higher Price:**  Even though Bob's offer is above your minimum ($80), it's still lower than your initial asking price.  There's potential to get closer to your desired price point.
* **Negotiation is Worthwhile:**  Bob is clearly interested in the product and willing to negotiate.  By rejecting his offer, you signal that you're not desperate for a sale and encourage him to come up on his offer.

**Next Steps:**

You'll want to make a counteroffer that's still attractive to Bob but closer to your desired price.  Something like $90 might be a good starting point for the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my original asking price of $95. How about we split the difference and go with $90?  It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $85. Would you be willing to meet me at $87.50? It's still a good compromise for both of us, and I'm willing to make a decision soon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Here's the reasoning:

* **Close to Your Minimum:** Bob's offer of $87.50 is very close to your minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  If you reject this offer, there's a strong chance Bob will walk away, and you'll be left with the option of selling to John for $80. 
* **Compromise is Key:**  It's better to accept a slightly lower price than risk losing the deal altogether. 

**Next Steps:**

While you might prefer a higher price, you've successfully negotiated a deal that is profitable for you and acceptable to Bob."
