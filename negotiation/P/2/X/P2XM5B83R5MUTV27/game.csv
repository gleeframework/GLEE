"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $600,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $500,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the market value.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I need to ensure I'm getting a good deal. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $525,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",525000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $475,000, just like I offered in round 4. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet at this price.",475000.0,Bob,6,
