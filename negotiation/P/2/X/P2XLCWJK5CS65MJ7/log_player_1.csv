Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product at such a high value. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1200000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $800000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Since Bob's offer of $800,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round.
