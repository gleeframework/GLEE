"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product at such a high value. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1200000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $800000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I must inform you that $800000 is below the minimum value I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1000000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
