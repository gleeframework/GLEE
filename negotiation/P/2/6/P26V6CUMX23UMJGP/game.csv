"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  While $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you be willing to accept $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'll meet you at $1,050,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. This is already a significant discount from my original offer. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
