Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but still lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Focus on value:**  My message emphasizes the value of the product to Bob, making it more appealing.
* **Open to negotiation:** I leave the door open for counteroffers, suggesting I'm willing to negotiate to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Note:** This is just an initial offer. I'll need to assess Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, I believe I can come to an even better agreement. How about we set the product price at $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  I have room to negotiate further and potentially secure a better price. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Knowing I have John's offer of $1,200,000 gives me confidence to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating.

**Next Step:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $1,100,000 or higher, depending on how I assess Bob's willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  Given the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:** I'm adjusting my price down from my initial offer but still keeping it above Bob's last offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate.
* **Remaining firm:** I'm not accepting Bob's offer just yet, as I believe I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Maintaining confidence:** My message emphasizes the value of the product, suggesting I'm confident in the price I'm offering.

**Strategy:**

By continuing to negotiate, I aim to reach a deal closer to my desired price of $1,200,000, while still considering the possibility of accepting John's offer if Bob proves unwilling to come up."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand your position and respect the value you place on this product. Considering our previous discussions, I would like to propose a price of $1,100,000. This feels like a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Bob's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is now at my initial offering price. This indicates a strong willingness from Bob to close the deal.
* **Close to my minimum:** While I would prefer a higher price, $1,100,000 is only slightly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate might result in a higher price, but it also risks losing the deal altogether. The current offer is a good compromise. 
* **Time Efficiency:** Accepting this offer saves time and effort compared to further negotiation.

**Conclusion:**

Considering the potential of a prolonged negotiation, the risk of Bob walking away, and the time involved, accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible choice. This allows me to secure a price that is close to my desired price and avoids potential delays and uncertainties."
