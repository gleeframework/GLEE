"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $1,450,000 is below my maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Alice is likely willing to go lower to make a sale. I'll counteroffer and see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm aiming significantly lower than Alice's offer, closer to her estimated value of the product ($1,200,000).  This leaves room for negotiation while still offering a potentially profitable deal for Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000,  which is still well below what the product is worth to you. This is my final offer,  as I have another buyer ready to pay $1,200,000.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has countered with a price that is a good deal for me ($1,300,000) and is below my maximum budget. She's also introduced a sense of urgency with the mention of another buyer. While I could potentially negotiate a slightly lower price, the risk of losing the deal to the other buyer outweighs the potential savings at this point."
