"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll recognize its worth.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time.  This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for some room for negotiation.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $850,000 is a respectable figure, it doesn't fully reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see a number closer to my initial ask. How about we meet halfway and settle at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I see the value of the product, $1,025,000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $925,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This reflects a compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $925,000 is closer to the mark, but I'm still seeking a price that accurately represents the product's worth.  Let's try $980,000. This feels like a fair offer considering its value.",980000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $980,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant step up from my previous offer. This reflects my genuine interest in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,6,
