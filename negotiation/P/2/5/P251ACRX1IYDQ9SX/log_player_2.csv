"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll recognize its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is far too high.  It's best to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time.  This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for some room for negotiation.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $850,000 is a respectable figure, it doesn't fully reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see a number closer to my initial ask. How about we meet halfway and settle at $1,025,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still too high, but we're getting closer.  It's worth continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I see the value of the product, $1,025,000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $925,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This reflects a compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $925,000 is closer to the mark, but I'm still seeking a price that accurately represents the product's worth.  Let's try $980,000. This feels like a fair offer considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, I'm still not comfortable paying that much. It's worth seeing if we can close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $980,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant step up from my previous offer. This reflects my genuine interest in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
