"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering your potential profit from the product. Let's find common ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to his budget, he can still get the product for cheaper from John. There's no need to take a risk and continue negotiating with Alice, especially since she's already shown a willingness to compromise."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for the product. This would allow us both to walk away with a good deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. However, $900000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925000. This is my final offer, as I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. While Alice's offer of $925,000 is closer to his ideal price, it's still higher than what he can get from John. There's no guarantee that Alice will accept his counteroffer in the next round, and he might end up paying even more than $925,000. It's more prudent to take the sure thing and buy from John for $800,000."
