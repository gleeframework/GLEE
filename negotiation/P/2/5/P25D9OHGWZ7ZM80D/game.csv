"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1000000 is still higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the potential for us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering your potential profit from the product. Let's find common ground here.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to offer $900000 for the product. This would allow us both to walk away with a good deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. However, $900000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925000. This is my final offer, as I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal.",925000.0,Alice,5,
