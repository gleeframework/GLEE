,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle!",105.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $105. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'll offer $95. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $95 is still too low for me. I'm offering $100. That's the minimum I can accept, and it's a fair price for a product that's worth that much to you. What do you say?",100.0,Alice,5,
