,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm happy to pay $85, which is still a good deal for both of us.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $105 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $90.  If you're willing to meet me there, we can close the deal.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $90. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $95. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",95.0,Alice,5,
