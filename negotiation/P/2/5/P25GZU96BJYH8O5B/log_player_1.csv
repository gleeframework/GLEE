"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to leave room for negotiation and potentially get a better price than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with it. I'll try to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still keeping it above my minimum and hopefully closer to a point where Bob might be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now above my minimum and only $10 less than what John is offering. I'll accept this offer, as further negotiation might risk losing both buyers and ending up with nothing."
