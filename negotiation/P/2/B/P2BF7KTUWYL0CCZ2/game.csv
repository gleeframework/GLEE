"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the quality you described. However, $120 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $80 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and would like to find a solution that works for both of us. While I cannot accept $80 due to the production costs and value we place on the product, I am willing to negotiate. How about considering $95 as the price for the product?",95.0,Alice,3,
