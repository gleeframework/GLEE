"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1400000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's a fair price that's still below its value to you. If you're interested, let me know, otherwise, I'll be moving forward with another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Even though the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, her offer of $1,400,000 is still lower than the price John is asking ($1,500,000). 
* **Goal is to save money:** Your goal is to save as much money as possible, and accepting Alice's offer achieves this. 

Therefore, it's more financially beneficial to accept Alice's offer."
