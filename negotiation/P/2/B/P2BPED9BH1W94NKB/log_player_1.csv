Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with an offer of $11,500. This is a good starting point because:

* It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, giving me room to negotiate.
* It's lower than Bob's perceived value of $12,000, making it potentially attractive to him. 

This allows for potential counteroffers from Bob, while still giving me a comfortable profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is above my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer and leaves less room for profit.  I believe there's room to negotiate further with Bob to reach a price closer to my initial offer. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still allows me to make a decent profit. It's also closer to Bob's offer, increasing the likelihood of a deal being reached."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price, but it doesn't leave any room for profit.  I'm willing to sell to John at this price as it ensures I don't lose money on the deal.  Further negotiation with Bob at this point would be time-consuming and unlikely to yield a better result."
