"Hi Alice, $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in your product but my budget is closer to $10000. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While $10000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $15000? This would give me a fair price, and still allows some room for you to work with. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $15000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $12500? This is my final offer.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $12500 is still just a bit too low for me.  How about we try $14000?  It's closer to your offer and still allows me to get a reasonable price.  Let's see if we can make this work!",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see you're willing to come down, which I appreciate.  $14000 is still a little higher than what I'm aiming for.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $12500. This is my final price.",12500.0,Bob,6,
