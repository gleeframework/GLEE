"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for a price that I think is very competitive. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I think you'll find it's a fair and reasonable price.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 was a bit above your budget. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we settle at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $775,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,5,
