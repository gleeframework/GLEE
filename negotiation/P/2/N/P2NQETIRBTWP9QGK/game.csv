"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1,150,000 is closer to my target, but I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground.  I'm willing to go up to $1,125,000.  This is a fair price, and I believe it reflects the value of the product for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1125000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,125,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,130,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer.
