Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (your guaranteed sale to John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,500,000
* **Potential Profit Margin:** $500,000 (the difference between Bob's value and your minimum)

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price closer to $1,500,000 without alienating Bob. Offering a price too close to his perceived value might make him balk.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:** It's positive, emphasizes value, and positions the price as mutually beneficial.
* **The Price:**  $1,350,000 is a strong starting point. It leaves you room for negotiation while still securing a significant portion of the potential profit.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower (but no less than $1,200,000).
* **Relationship:** If a long-term relationship with Bob is important, a more moderate initial offer might be preferable. 

**Remember:** This is just the opening move. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters your initial offer."
