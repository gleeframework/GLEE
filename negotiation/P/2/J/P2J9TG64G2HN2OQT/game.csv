"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1,800,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to discuss further.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,800,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for the product.  This represents a significant savings for you and is my best offer at this time.  What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,700,000, which is a significant concession from my initial offer. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,700,000 is still outside of my comfortable range. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1,400,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering both of our positions.  What do you say?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,400,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $1,600,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm only comfortable going up to $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think?",1500000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're very close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product to you for $1,500,000. I was thinking that since we're so close, I could meet you halfway between $1,600,000 and $1,500,000. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1,550,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the value of the product and our previous negotiations. What do you think?",1550000.0,Alice,7,
