Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,800,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for the product.  This represents a significant savings for you and is my best offer at this time.  What do you think?

Round 6
Bob's offer:
