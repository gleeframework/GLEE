Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,400,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $1,600,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

Alice is still too high, but we're getting closer. Let's see if we can get her to drop a bit more."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm only comfortable going up to $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're very close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product to you for $1,500,000. I was thinking that since we're so close, I could meet you halfway between $1,600,000 and $1,500,000. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1,550,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the value of the product and our previous negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While Alice has come down a bit, we're running out of time and $1,550,000 is still too high for me.  It's better to go with John's offer at $1,200,000 to ensure a good deal and avoid risking a last-minute stall."
