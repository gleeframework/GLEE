Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer starts by aiming high, above your minimum acceptable price.  It's a gamble, but it has the potential to earn you the most money. Here's the logic:

* **High Offer:** A higher price gives you more room to negotiate if Bob counters. 
* **Safety Net:** You know you'll get $800,000 from John, so you can afford to be a little bolder.
* **Potential for Profit:** If Bob values the product even more than $900,000, you have a chance to earn significantly more.

Let me know if you want to adjust the price based on Bob's response!"
