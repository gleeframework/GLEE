Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can come to an even better agreement. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $8750. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. While $8,750 is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8,750 is still quite a bit lower than what I need. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This reflects a fair compromise considering both our needs."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my position, Alice. I really value this opportunity, and I would like to propose a price of $9000. This feels like a fair compromise between the value of the product to me and the cost you're expecting. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting closer to my target, and we're nearing the halfway point of our negotiations. While I'd prefer to get closer to $9,500, there's a chance Bob might become unwilling to negotiate further. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and reduces the risk of ending up with nothing."
