Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$9,500:** This price is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000, but leaves room for negotiation. It also allows me to maximize my profit while still potentially making a deal with Bob.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and direct, clearly stating the offer and encouraging a response. It also acknowledges the value to Bob, which can make him feel more comfortable with the offer. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize profit:** I want to earn as much as possible, but I also want to keep the deal open with Bob. 
* **Potential for counter-offers:** Offering a slightly higher price allows for some negotiation space and the possibility of Bob counter-offering. 
* **Backup plan:** I have the option to sell to John for $10,000 if negotiations with Bob fail, so I'm not desperate for a sale at a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counteroffer at $9,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is within your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Accepting Bob's offer:** While I prefer a higher price, $9,000 is still significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000 and within the range of a good deal. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a chance I could get a slightly higher price by counter-offering, but the risk of Bob rejecting my counteroffer is high. 
* **Time and Effort:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob would require more time and effort. Accepting his offer is the most efficient choice.

**Reasoning:**

* **Financial gain:**  $9,000 is a substantial profit for me and a good result overall. 
* **Avoiding potential losses:**  There's a risk that continued negotiation could lead to a lower price or even a breakdown in the deal. Accepting Bob's offer secures a solid deal. 
* **Time is valuable:**  I have the option to sell to John for $10,000, but accepting Bob's offer allows me to finalize the sale quickly and move on to other opportunities."
