Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 8500}

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $8,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my target price, I've reached a point where continuing negotiations with Bob is unlikely to yield a better outcome.  It's better to secure the guaranteed $8,000 from John than risk getting stuck with a lower price from Bob."
