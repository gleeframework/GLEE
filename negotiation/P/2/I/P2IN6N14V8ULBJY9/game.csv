"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay closer to my original price. I'm offering the product for $9,500.  This is a fair price that considers your budget and my value for the product.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,000. Can you consider this offer?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $9,000, but it's still not quite there for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I can't go lower than $9,250. This is a fair compromise that considers both our positions. Let's try to close this deal.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $9,100. Can you consider this offer?",9100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway. However, $9,100 is still a bit low. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to stay above $9,150. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it. We're both close to a deal!",9150.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $9,150 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000. This is my final offer. If you're willing to accept, I'll buy the product from you. If not, I'll have to consider buying it from John for $8,000.",9000.0,Bob,8,
