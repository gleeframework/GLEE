"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its value to you and still allows me to make a healthy profit.  Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000 to close this deal.  This is still a great price for you, and it ensures I get a fair return on my investment.  Let's make this happen!",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $10,750 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and settle at $10,875. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you. Let's make this happen! ",10875.0,Alice,5,
