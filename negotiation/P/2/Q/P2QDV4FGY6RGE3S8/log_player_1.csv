Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, he has some room to negotiate, but I'm confident he'll see the value.  I'll be ready to adjust my price if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not ready to settle for that price yet. I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."

I'm dropping my price a bit to show flexibility, but I'm still holding out for a good profit.  $1,300,000 is a fair price considering the value of the product for Bob. Hopefully, we can close the deal this round."

I'm still aiming for a higher price. Bob is getting closer, but I believe I can get more. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can reach an agreement."
