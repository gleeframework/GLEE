"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 was a bit steep, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable going all the way down to $9,000. I can meet you in the middle at $10,500. Would that work for you?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm getting close to the price I'm comfortable with. I can do $10,200. That's as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",10200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're firm on the price.  Let's make this our last exchange - I'd be willing to pay $10,000.  It's a fair offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal.",10000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we could have a good conversation. However, I'm still a bit short of what I was hoping to get for the product. I can do $10,500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If that's not acceptable, I'll have to consider other options.",10500.0,Alice,7,
