"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $7,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",7500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get closer to your target price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $7,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me and the market demand.
