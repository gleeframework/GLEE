"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $13,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  This is still a fair price for both of us, considering your value of $12,000 and my maximum budget of $15,000. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my minimum value of $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12,750. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",12750.0,Alice,3,
