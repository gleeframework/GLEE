I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $95 is better than nothing, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}

Bob's offer of $100 is my minimum acceptable price, and it's the same as what John would pay.  I'll take the sure thing and sell to Bob."
