"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,200,000 for the product.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I see the value in it, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this stage.  I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to negotiate. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $1,225,000 for the product.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,225,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000.  Let's try to find a deal that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $1,100,000 is enough to justify the value of the product. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My counteroffer is $1,300,000 for the product.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,300,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,150,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  I believe this demonstrates my good faith and willingness to meet you halfway.  Let's work towards a solution.",1150000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not convinced that $1,150,000 is enough to justify the value of the product. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My counteroffer is $1,350,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,200,000.  This is my final offer.  If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll need to consider other options.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that we've been negotiating for a while, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to $1,200,000. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to be honest with you, I'm starting to lose interest in continuing the negotiation. My counteroffer is $1,250,000 for the product, and if this is not acceptable, I'll be forced to consider other options, including selling to John for $1,000,000.",1250000.0,Alice,9,
