Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can't justify that price. To make this deal work, I'm willing to offer $800,000.  This is my absolute maximum, but I believe it's a fair price considering my needs and the product's potential. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
