"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find valuable. Given its unique features and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000. I'm confident this represents a fair offer, but I'm open to discussing it further. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can't justify that price. To make this deal work, I'm willing to offer $800,000.  This is my absolute maximum, but I believe it's a fair price considering my needs and the product's potential.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues its true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This offer reflects the product's value while acknowledging your interest.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
