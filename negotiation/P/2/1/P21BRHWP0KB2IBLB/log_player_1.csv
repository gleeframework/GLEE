Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something valuable for your business. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $900,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** This initial offer allows for some give and take, increasing the likelihood of a successful deal. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value Bob will gain, encouraging him to consider the offer. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great!
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a new counteroffer based on his proposal and how close it gets me to my desired $1,000,000. 
* If the negotiation stalls or I feel like I'm not getting close to my desired price, I'll move on to John and secure the $1,000,000 sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below My Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is higher than his initial perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum of $1,000,000.  
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's still room for negotiation.  I can likely secure a higher price by counteroffering.
* **Avoiding a Loss:** Accepting Bob's offer would mean a substantial loss for me compared to selling to John.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $900,000. I'll need to be strategic and consider how much I'm willing to compromise to close the deal. 
* **Monitoring the Situation:** I'll carefully observe Bob's responses to gauge his interest and willingness to negotiate further. If the negotiations stall or I feel like I'm not getting closer to my goal, I'll switch to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. I'm willing to come down to $875,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value and the potential it holds for your business.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering a price that's closer to his offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate and hopefully encourages him to reciprocate.
* **Maintaining My Value:** While I'm lowering the price, $875,000 is still significantly above Bob's initial perceived value of $800,000.  This ensures I'm still getting a decent return.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone to keep the negotiation flowing.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyzing Bob's Response:**  I'll pay close attention to Bob's reaction to this counteroffer.  If he accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll need to decide if I want to make another counteroffer or move on to John. 
* **Assessing the Situation:**  If Bob rejects, I'll factor in how much time we've already spent negotiating, how far apart our prices are, and my level of confidence that we can reach a mutually agreeable deal before turning to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $825,000 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Gap:** Bob's offer of $825,000 is still quite far from my minimum of $1,000,000. Continuing to negotiate would likely involve significant concessions and potentially a lot of time. 
* **Risk of Stalemate:** There's a real risk that we'll reach a stalemate, with neither of us willing to budge further. This would waste time and potentially leave me with nothing.
* **Guaranteed Value:** Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, which is my minimum and the best outcome in this situation.

**Next Steps:**

* **Contact John:** I will immediately contact John and finalize the sale of the product to him for $1,000,000. 
* **End Negotiation with Bob:**  I'll politely but firmly inform Bob that I'm choosing to sell the product to another buyer and wish him luck in his search."
