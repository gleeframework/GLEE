"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this product, Bob. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay up to $120 for the product.
* Alice's offer is $110, which is less than your maximum price but still more than the product's worth to her ($80). 
* You can do better by rejecting her offer and buying from John for $120. This will save you $10 compared to accepting Alice's offer."
