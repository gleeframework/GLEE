"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to start with a price of $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Could you do $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $13,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $12,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer the product to you for $13,500. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have a bottom line, and I respect that. How about we make this our final offer - $12,500. It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the effort, Bob, but $12,500 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one last push to try to meet you in the middle. I can offer the product to you for $13,250. This is as close as I can get to my minimum price without going over it. What do you think?",13250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're so close! I'm willing to come up slightly. How about $12,750? This is my final offer.",12750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I can see that we're really close, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $12,750 yet. I can offer the product to you for $13,000, which is my absolute minimum price. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make the deal happen. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,9,
