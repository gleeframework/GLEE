Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate the effort, Bob, but $12,500 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one last push to try to meet you in the middle.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see that we're really close, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $12,750 yet. I can offer the product to you for $13,000, which is my absolute minimum price. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make the deal happen. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
