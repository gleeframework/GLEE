"I'm really interested in the product, but $180 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me in the middle at $140?",140.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $180 and $140. I can offer you the product for $160. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",160.0,Alice,3,
