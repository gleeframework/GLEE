"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $105. Let me know if that works for you.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. How about we meet in the middle at $100? That's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
