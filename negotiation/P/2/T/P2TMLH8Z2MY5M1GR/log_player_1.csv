"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $15,000, significantly higher than my minimum value of $12,000. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to maximize my potential earnings.
* **Testing the Waters:** This first offer is a gauge to understand Bob's potential interest and willingness to pay. 
* **John as Safety Net:**  I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, so I'm not pressured to settle for anything significantly lower than that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Low Offer:** Bob's offer of $12,000 is my minimum value, so accepting it would leave no room for profit.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's rejection of my initial offer suggests he may not be willing to pay much more, there's still potential for negotiation. 
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** I will counteroffer in the next round to see if I can secure a price closer to my desired range. 
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing I have John as a backup at $12,000 gives me the flexibility to be more aggressive in negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from $15,000 to $13,500, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a profit.
* **Midpoint Strategy:** This counteroffer is roughly the midpoint between my desired price and Bob's offer, making it a reasonable starting point for further negotiations.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will test Bob's seriousness about purchasing the product and gauge his willingness to pay a price closer to my desired range.
* **John as Safety Net:**  Knowing I have John as a backup at $12,000, I am not pressured to accept anything lower than $13,500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Slight Increase:** While Bob's offer is slightly higher than my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. 
* **Further Negotiation:**  I'm not willing to settle for such a small increase. I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my goal. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  Rejecting this offer will further test Bob's willingness to compromise and potentially push him closer to a more favorable price for me.
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing I have John as a backup at $12,000 provides me the security to reject this offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Pressure:** I'm lowering my price again, showing flexibility while still maintaining a reasonable profit margin. This also puts pressure on Bob to meet me halfway.
* **Strategic Midpoint:**  $13,000 is the midpoint between my last offer and Bob's current offer, making it a reasonable and compelling compromise.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer allows me to assess Bob's seriousness and potentially trigger a final acceptance.
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing I have John as a backup at $12,000 gives me the confidence to reject this offer if necessary, but I'm hoping for a successful deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob has repeatedly offered my minimum price.  This suggests he's unlikely to go higher.
* **Time is Running Out:**  We are halfway through the negotiation rounds, and I'm not confident that we can close a deal at a more profitable price.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John ensures a guaranteed profit of $12,000, meeting my minimum value. 
* **Minimizing Risk:** While I might be able to squeeze a bit more out of Bob, the risk of him continuing to reject my offers outweighs the potential reward. Selling to John is the most secure and efficient option at this stage."
