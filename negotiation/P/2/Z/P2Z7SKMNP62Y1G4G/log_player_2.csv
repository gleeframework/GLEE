"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 
Alice's offer is quite high, leaving little room for negotiation. By rejecting, we signal that we're looking for a significantly better price. We're still far from John's $12,000 price, so there's room to negotiate without the risk of Alice walking away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me right now. I'm thinking closer to $9,000 would be a fair price. What do you say?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice moved closer to our desired price, we still have some room for negotiation before reaching John's price. Rejecting again signals we're serious about a lower price and keeps the negotiation open."

{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle at $9,500? That feels like a fair compromise."",

}
```

**Reasoning:**

* We're getting closer to John's $12,000 backup, so larger counteroffers become riskier.
* $9,500 represents a reasonable midpoint between the current offer ($10,000) and our previous counter ($9,000). 
*  This counteroffer keeps a collaborative tone, aiming for a mutually agreeable solution."
