"Bob, I understand your position, but $1100000 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1150000.  Let's meet in the middle.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, we're getting closer, but  $1050000 is still too far off for me. I'm willing to go down to $1125000 as a final compromise. This would be a great deal for both of us. Let's finalize this before we lose the opportunity.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
