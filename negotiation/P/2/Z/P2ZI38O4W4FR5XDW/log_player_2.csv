Alice is showing some flexibility but I'm still hoping to get a better price.  I'm not ready to commit to $900,000 yet. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can close the gap further."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is consistently meeting me halfway, and we're now very close to my ideal price.  $887,500 is a good deal for me, considering my maximum budget and the fact that I have several rounds left.  I'm confident I can't get a significantly lower price, and it's better to secure the deal now than risk losing it and having to buy from John at a much higher price."
