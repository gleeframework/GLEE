"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1200000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and it's a good starting point for our negotiation. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  I'm looking to spend a bit less.  Given the value I place on the product and considering the market,  I'd be willing to offer $1000000.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000, considering the value you've mentioned. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1300000. What are your thoughts on that?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. While $1300000 is closer to where I'd like to be, I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to offer $1100000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for me, and it gives you a comfortable profit margin. Let's see if we can reach an agreement here.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $1100000. Considering the value you've placed on the product and the fact that I'm willing to sell it to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1100000 and $1300000. I'm offering it to you for $1200000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can wrap up the deal here.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
