"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm very interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Would you be open to considering that?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $1200000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $1350000, which is a $150000 discount from my initial offer. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1350000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to go up to $1250000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're willing to go up to $1250000, Bob. I appreciate your flexibility. I can meet you halfway, but I need to get a bit closer to my target. How about $1300000? It's a $50000 compromise from my previous offer, and I think it's a fair price for this incredible product.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1300000 is closer to what I'm aiming for, but I'm still a bit above my budget.  I can go to $1275000, which is a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're getting close, Bob! I appreciate your flexibility. I can see that you're trying to find a sweet spot. I'm willing to meet you at $1275000, but I'd like to throw in an additional incentive. I'll include a 2-year warranty on the product, which is a $50000 value. So, the total price would be $1275000, plus the warranty, which is essentially worth $1325000. What do you think?",1325000.0,Alice,7,
