Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $115."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** By starting with an offer of $115, I'm aiming slightly below Bob's perceived value ($120) while still securing a significant profit above my minimum ($100). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This initial offer leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price, making him feel more involved in the process. 
* **Backup Option:** I'm aware that I can sell to John for $100 if the negotiation with Bob falls through, giving me a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $105 is above my minimum selling price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob's counteroffer suggests he's interested but trying to get a better deal. By rejecting and countering, I can aim for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By suggesting $110, I'm demonstrating flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum price.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** This tactic often feels fair to both parties and can lead to a quicker agreement. 
* **Maintaining Profit:**  $110 still provides me with a $10 profit, which is a reasonable outcome in this scenario."
