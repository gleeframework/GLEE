"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $115. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $115 is close to your maximum budget, but there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting and making a counteroffer, you might be able to secure a lower price, saving you some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $105?"",
""product_price"": 105
}
```

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer attempts to strike a balance:

* **Significant Reduction:**  A $10 decrease from Alice's offer shows you're serious about a lower price.
* **Still Above Alice's Value:** Offering $105 ensures you're still proposing a price that's profitable for Alice (above her $100 value).
* **Room for Negotiation:** This leaves space for further negotiation if Alice counters. You can then decide to meet in the middle or consider your alternative option (John's offer)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Compromise:**  Alice met you in the middle, splitting the difference between your previous offer ($105) and her initial offer ($115). 
* **Within Budget & Significant Savings:** $110 is within your $120 budget and represents a $10 saving compared to John's offer.
* **Minimizing Risk:** Further haggling could frustrate Alice, and there's no guarantee she'll go lower. Accepting now secures a good deal."
