"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. $900,000 is still too high for him. He should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to get a good deal. He knows Alice's minimum selling price is $800,000, so he's offering $700,000 as a starting point for negotiation. This counteroffer leaves room for negotiation and shows that Bob is serious about buying the product but also wants a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay.  He's already rejected a price of $900,000 and should continue negotiating to see if he can get it lower. Buying from John at this point would be a significant loss, so rejecting and counter-offering is the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, showing his willingness to negotiate. He's now offering $750,000, which is halfway between his previous offer and Alice's current offer. This demonstrates his seriousness while still leaving room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob prefers to pay even less, Alice's offer of $825,000 is getting closer to his preferred price.  It's likely that Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and continuing to reject offers risks reaching the end of the negotiation rounds and having to buy from John at a much higher price. Accepting the offer is the most financially sound decision at this point."
