"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product. However, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my target price. I'd be willing to pay $1,300,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize your perspective, the value this product brings is truly significant.  I could meet you halfway between our previous offers, how about $1,350,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob is still aiming to get the product for as low as possible. While Alice has come down to $1,350,000, Bob can likely still push for a better price. He will counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I see you're willing to compromise, and I appreciate that. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  Let's split the difference again.  I'll offer $1,325,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you clearly see the value in this product, as do I. I'm willing to come down slightly further, to $1,337,500. This reflects my confidence in the product's value while acknowledging your desire for a fair price. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,337,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,337,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has been consistently trying to lower the price, and Alice's offer of $1,337,500 is close to his target.  He's likely to accept this offer to save time and avoid potential complications with further negotiation.  He's also not far from his maximum budget, and a small increase isn't going to significantly impact his budget."
