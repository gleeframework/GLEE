"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product. However, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my target price. I'd be willing to pay $1,300,000 for it. What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize your perspective, the value this product brings is truly significant.  I could meet you halfway between our previous offers, how about $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I see you're willing to compromise, and I appreciate that. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  Let's split the difference again.  I'll offer $1,325,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
