Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product. However, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my target price. I'd be willing to pay $1,300,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see you're willing to compromise, and I appreciate that. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  Let's split the difference again.  I'll offer $1,325,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly very interested and the product's value to him is significantly higher than our minimum. While his offer is getting closer to our acceptable range, we still have room to negotiate a bit higher."
