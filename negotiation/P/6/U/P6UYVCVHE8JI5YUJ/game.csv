"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $90 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $82. What do you think?",82.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $78 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to compromise further. I can offer you the product for $81. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",81.0,Alice,5,
