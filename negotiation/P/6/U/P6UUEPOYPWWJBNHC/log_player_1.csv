Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $90. I believe it would be highly valuable to you."", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aiming for the highest possible price within Bob's valuation ($100) maximizes potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting slightly below Bob's maximum allows room for potential counter-offers, still ensuring a price above your minimum.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer at $80 provides leverage, so you don't have to drastically undersell to Bob."
