{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 925000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $800,000. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Aiming for a price closer to Bob's valuation maximizes your profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $925,000 leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.

This strategy seeks a balance between securing a high price and ensuring Bob finds the deal attractive enough to accept rather than risking a rejection."
