"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Since you can get the product from John for $1,000,000, rejecting Alice's offer is the best option."
