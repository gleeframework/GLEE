Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of a price around $8500. I'm willing to pay that much for the product. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum price, I think I can get a better deal if I counteroffer."

Bob is getting increasingly stubborn and I'm not sure I can get him to budge much more.  While $8,200 isn't a terrible price, I'm feeling a bit frustrated with the negotiation.  It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $8,000 from John."
