"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500. It's a fair price for both of us and allows you to make a decent profit. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price. How about $10,500? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a decent profit. Let's try to find a price that works for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $10,500 is still a little high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow you to make a good profit. Let's seal the deal!",10000.0,Bob,4,
