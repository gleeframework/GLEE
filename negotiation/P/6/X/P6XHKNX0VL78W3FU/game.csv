"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. It's a fair price, considering your asking price and my budget. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is still a bit lower than I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my initial offer. Let's make this deal happen!",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend right now.  I'm happy to offer $10,750 for the product, which is closer to my budget and still a fair price for the value.  Let's try to meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,
