# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal is to save money.**  $11,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.
* **There's still room for negotiation.**  Alice has shown willingness to compromise, and Bob can try to push for a lower price.
* **John is a backup option.**  If negotiation fails, Bob can always buy from John for $10,000."
