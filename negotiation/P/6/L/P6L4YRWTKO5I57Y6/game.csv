"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I can't afford $14,000 for this product. How about we aim for a price closer to $10,000? I hope you can consider this offer.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This would still leave you with a significant profit, and I wouldn't have to compromise my own bottom line. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12500.0,Alice,3,
