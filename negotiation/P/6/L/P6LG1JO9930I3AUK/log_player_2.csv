"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product for $1,400,000. This price is significantly lower than its worth to me, but I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us. If you decline, I will be selling it to another buyer for a higher price. I believe this offer provides you with a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a favorable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.
