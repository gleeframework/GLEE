"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $1,000,000? That's a fair deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
