Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your interests, and I'm confident you'll find it highly beneficial. I'm asking for $1,450,000, which reflects its true worth and potential.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, it's always wise to try for a higher profit. Bob's perceived value of $800,000 gives us some wiggle room.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's valuation but lower than John's allows room for negotiation while still aiming high.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and Bob's potential benefit, creating a positive tone for the negotiation.

By starting high and using a persuasive approach, I increase the chances of securing a deal closer to my desired outcome while still having the safety net of John's offer."
