Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This high starting price gives me room to negotiate and potentially earn more than my minimum. 
* **Testing Bob's Interest:** This will give me an indication of Bob's genuine interest in the product and his budget. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. 
* I'll keep John's $1,000,000 offer in mind as a safety net if the negotiation with Bob stalls or becomes unproductive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

* **Negotiation Opportunity:** Even though his offer is low, Bob has shown interest, indicating a potential for a deal.
* **Counteroffer to Explore Potential:** Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and gauge his willingness to compromise. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range. 
* I will consider John's offer of $1,000,000 as a backup option if negotiations with Bob become too time-consuming or unproductive."

* **Testing Bob's Flexibility:** This counteroffer allows me to gauge if Bob is willing to meet me halfway.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
