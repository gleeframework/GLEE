"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $1,100,000 is a bit too steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my desired price. How about we settle on $1,000,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
