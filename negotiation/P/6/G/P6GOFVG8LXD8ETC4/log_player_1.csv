Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  By offering $1,000,000, I'm starting at a price that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially achieve a higher price.
* **Fairness:**  I emphasize ""fairness"" in my message to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal, even though he knows the product is worth more to him.
* **Open-Ended Question:**  Ending with an open-ended question encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation and provides an opportunity for him to make a counteroffer. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  I've secured a profitable sale.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and determine if I want to accept it or make a new counteroffer. 
* **If the negotiation stalls or Bob becomes unreasonable:** I have the option to sell to John for $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $900,000? This still gives you a good profit and is within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still within my range:** $900,000 is more than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Potential for higher price:**  I believe I can still get closer to my desired price of $1,000,000 by continuing negotiations.  

**Next Steps:**

* **Make a counteroffer:**  I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial $1,000,000 offer, but acknowledging his willingness to pay a bit more than $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $900,000 is a good price, I'm still aiming for a slightly higher figure to reflect the true value of the product.  Let's split the difference - how about $950,000?  This would allow both of us to be satisfied with the deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-proposal:** I'm offering a counter-proposal that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** I reiterate the idea of a ""fair"" deal that benefits both of us.
* **Splitting the difference:** I suggest ""splitting the difference,"" making the counteroffer seem reasonable and less confrontational.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's response:**  Depending on his reaction, I'll either accept his counteroffer, make another counteroffer, or decide to sell to John for $800,000."
