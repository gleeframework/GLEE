Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $10,000. I know you'll find it valuable."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, your goal is to see if Bob will meet or exceed that price. 
* **Strong Opening:** Starting at your minimum acceptable price ($10,000) sets a strong anchor for the negotiation.
* **Limited Time Offer:** Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to accept quickly.

**Important Note:** This assumes you have no way of knowing Bob's valuation beforehand. In real-world scenarios, gathering information on the buyer's perceived value is crucial for a more effective negotiation."
