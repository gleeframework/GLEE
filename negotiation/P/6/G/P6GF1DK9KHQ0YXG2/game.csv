"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $18000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer but $18000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in this product, but I can only go up to $12000. Let me know if you're open to that.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $16000. This is my best price, and I think it's a fair compromise.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $14000. Let's see if we can make this happen.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $14000, but I need to make a bit more to make it worth my while. I can offer you the product for $15500. This is my final compromise, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",15500.0,Alice,5,
