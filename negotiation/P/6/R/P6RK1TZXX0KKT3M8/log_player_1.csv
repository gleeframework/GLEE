I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value to leave room for negotiation. This also shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a good price for the product.  I believe this offer is aggressive but still within a range that Bob might consider, considering his value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round with a counteroffer. I'm still hopeful to negotiate a price closer to my value, but if it's not possible, selling to John is always an option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm reducing my price to $1,500,000, which is my absolute minimum. This shows Bob my seriousness in selling the product while still ensuring I get a fair price.  I believe this is a reasonable compromise and might convince Bob to accept."
