"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

It's too early to accept Alice's offer.  It's significantly higher than your maximum budget, and you have a better option available.  The best strategy is to reject Alice's offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with my maximum budget.  This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product but also sets a clear boundary.  If she rejects this, I can always go with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is now within my budget, and it's likely she won't go lower.  There's no point in risking further negotiation and potentially losing the deal.  I'll accept her offer and save $300,000 compared to buying from John."
