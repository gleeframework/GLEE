Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price. It's worth exploring if we can find a middle ground before selling to John."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $825,000.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.
