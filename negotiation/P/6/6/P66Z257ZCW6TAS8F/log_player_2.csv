"Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Since you are willing to pay up to $80 for the product, and John is selling it for that price, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best option. You'll get the product for the same price but you'll have more leverage to negotiate with Alice in the future."
