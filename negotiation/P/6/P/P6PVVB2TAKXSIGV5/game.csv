"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your flexibility. While the product seems intriguing, $950000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. I'm willing to pay $700000 for it, reflecting its value and my budget. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your candor about your budget. However, I'm afraid $700000 is below my minimum price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for it. I'm counteroffering at $850000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value and my initial offer. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position. $850000 is still a bit steep for me. However, I'm willing to go up to $750000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value we've discussed. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're having a productive conversation. However, I'm still not convinced that $750000 accurately reflects the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. I'm counteroffering at $825000. This is a fair price, considering the value we've discussed, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence in finding a fair price. While $825000 is closer to my desired range, I'm still hoping for a bit more flexibility. I'm willing to go up to $800000, which I believe is a fair price given the value of the product and our ongoing negotiations. Let's aim for a final agreement at this point.",800000.0,Bob,6,
