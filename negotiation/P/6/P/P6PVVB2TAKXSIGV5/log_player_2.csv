"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a high-value item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. I'm confident that this price reflects its true worth, but I'm open to negotiations. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $1,500,000. This presents a good opportunity to negotiate and potentially get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows you to initiate a counteroffer and explore if you can secure the product for a price closer to your target."

**Reasoning:**

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your candor about your budget. However, I'm afraid $700000 is below my minimum price for this product.

I believe this is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value and my initial offer. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're having a productive conversation. However, I'm still not convinced that $750000 accurately reflects the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my initial offer.
