(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's always worth trying to negotiate a better price.  $10,000 is a good starting point, but you have room to try and lower it."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8500 is still a little too low for me. How about $9250? This is a very fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident it'll be worth it for you.

Let's try to meet in the middle. While $9250 is better than her first offer, I can still try for a lower price."
