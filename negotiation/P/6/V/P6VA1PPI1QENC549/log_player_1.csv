Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $18,000 is significantly higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  This is a fair price that still allows you to profit while staying within my budget.  Let me know what you think.
