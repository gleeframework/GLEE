Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will be a significant asset to you. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. Let me know your thoughts and if you have any questions."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $800,000, we also know our minimum acceptable price is $1,500,000. It's always good to start negotiations higher than your desired outcome.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The offer of $1,300,000 leaves room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can potentially settle somewhere between $1,300,000 and his perceived value.
* **Highlighting Value:** The message focuses on the ""unique value proposition"" to justify the high price and potentially persuade Bob. 
* **Backup Plan:** We have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, so there's limited risk in aiming high with Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. How we proceed depends entirely on Bob's response. We might need to adjust our approach based on his counter-offers or willingness to negotiate."
