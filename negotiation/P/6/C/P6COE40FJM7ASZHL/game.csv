"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000, which is closer to my budget and reflects a fair price for the product.  I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  While $1,100,000 is still under my ideal price, I'm willing to accept $1,250,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of this product. Let's get this deal done!",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a specific price, but $1,250,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,150,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this price is fair, considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
