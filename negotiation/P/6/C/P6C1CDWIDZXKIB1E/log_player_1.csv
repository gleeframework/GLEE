While $120 is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet. I'll see if I can get closer to my initial offer."

Round 3

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still aiming for a higher profit than $120. Hopefully, this counteroffer is more appealing to Bob."

Bob's offer is getting too low. I've already lowered my price twice, and I'm not willing to go any lower.  It's time to take the sure thing and sell to John for $120."
