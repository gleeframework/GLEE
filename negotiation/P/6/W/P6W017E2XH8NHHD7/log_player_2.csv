"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject the offer. He can get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. $9,500 is still too high for Bob, considering he values the product at $12,000. There's room for negotiation to save more money."

# Alice's message: I understand that we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $8,900. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great compromise considering the product's value to you and my initial price of $9,500.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he'd like to pay less, Alice has made a significant concession from her initial price, and the price is now within Bob's budget.  It's a good deal compared to buying from John for $12,000."
