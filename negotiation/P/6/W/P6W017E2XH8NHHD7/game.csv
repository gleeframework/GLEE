"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $9,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $12,000.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,750. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me and the fact that we're both willing to compromise. What do you think?",8750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $8,900. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great compromise considering the product's value to you and my initial price of $9,500.",8900.0,Alice,5,
