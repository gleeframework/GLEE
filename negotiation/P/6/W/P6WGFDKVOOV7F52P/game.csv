"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I'd like to negotiate a bit further.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? It's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500, which would be $9,750. Can we go with that?",9750.0,Bob,4,
