"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant investment, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1800000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget.  It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of the product, $1,800,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it.  This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a reasonable profit margin for you."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. Considering the value I bring to the table, I'm willing to lower the price to $1600000. This is a compromise that I think reflects the product's worth and allows for a fair profit for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still a bit high, but we're getting closer. It's worth negotiating further to try and get a price closer to our budget.  We're only in round 3, so we still have time to push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,600,000 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is my absolute maximum.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and allows for a good profit for you.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement here."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1500000 and $1600000. I'll lower the price to $1550000. This is a fair compromise that I think reflects the product's value and allows for a good profit for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $1,500,000.  While we've been getting closer, it's unlikely she'll go any lower. I've already used 5 rounds of negotiation.  It's not worth risking losing another 5 rounds in hopes she might budge. I'm going to buy from John for $1,500,000 to avoid further delays and potential lost opportunities."
