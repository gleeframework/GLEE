"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant investment, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1800000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of the product, $1800000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it.  This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a reasonable profit margin for you.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. Considering the value I bring to the table, I'm willing to lower the price to $1600000. This is a compromise that I think reflects the product's worth and allows for a fair profit for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1600000 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $1500000, which is my absolute maximum.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and allows for a good profit for you.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement here.",1500000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1500000 and $1600000. I'll lower the price to $1550000. This is a fair compromise that I think reflects the product's value and allows for a good profit for both of us.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
