"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exclusive product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is $1,000,000 to you. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you recognizing the product's value to me.  However, $800,000 is still a bit steep.  I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $750,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the effort I've put into acquiring it. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $750,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to pay $725,000. This is a fair price considering our previous negotiations, and it allows both of us to walk away feeling good about the deal. What do you say?",725000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $725,000.
