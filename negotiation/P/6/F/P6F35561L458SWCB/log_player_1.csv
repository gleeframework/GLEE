Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $175. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Not Too High:**  While we want to maximize profit, setting the price ridiculously high ($300, for example) will likely make Bob immediately reject the offer without even considering a counter-proposal. 
* **Alternative in Mind:**  We have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, so we don't need to go below that price. This gives us a strong fallback position.

This strategy aims to find a balance between maximizing potential profit and avoiding a situation where Bob walks away without a deal."
