Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking $100 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $100, knowing my minimum is $80. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. 
* **Positive Tone:** My message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:** By stating a price that's higher than my minimum, I create an opportunity for negotiation and potential for earning more than my minimum.

**Important Note:** This is just the initial offer.  I'll need to adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses and reactions throughout the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value vs. Potential:**  While $70 is better than my absolute minimum of $80, I believe there's still potential to negotiate a better price. 
* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price point, giving me more leverage in the negotiation. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling to John for $80 is a safe option, but I'm willing to take a slight risk by continuing to negotiate with Bob, hoping to secure a higher price.

**Next Steps:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my ideal value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you being interested in the product. While $70 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $85. This would still allow me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by moving closer to Bob's offer.  $85 is a midpoint between our initial positions.
* **Maintaining Value:**  $85 is still above my minimum of $80, so I'm not sacrificing too much.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a friendly and collaborative tone to keep the negotiation going.
* **Clear Expectations:** I've stated the price clearly and explained why it's a fair compromise.

**Strategy:** I'm hoping this counteroffer will be appealing enough for Bob to accept. If not, I'll need to assess his next response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Threshold:**  Bob's offer of $75 is now below my minimum acceptable price of $80.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While there's a chance I could get Bob to increase his offer further, the risk of him walking away entirely is too high. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $80, which is my minimum target. 

**Conclusion:** Given that Bob's offer is below my minimum and there's no guarantee of a better offer in the future, selling to John is the most sensible decision. It ensures I secure a profit without unnecessary risk."
