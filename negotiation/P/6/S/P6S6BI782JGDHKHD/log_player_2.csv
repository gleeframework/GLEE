"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. As we start the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $18,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $18,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I would only be willing to pay around $10,000.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14,000. This price is still higher than your initial offer, but I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $14,000 is still too high for me.  I could possibly stretch my budget to $11,000.  Do you think we can make a deal at that price?"", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $13,000. This price is still a bit higher than your initial offer, but I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $13,000.  You can get the product for $12,000 from John, so it makes more sense to take that deal and avoid further negotiation."
