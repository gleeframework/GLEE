"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $22,000 price. I would like to propose a price closer to $8,000 which is within my financial limits. I believe this could be a mutually beneficial arrangement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,000 is significantly below the value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit to show flexibility. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While $18,000 is still above my budget, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price closer to $10,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  However, $10,000 is still quite a distance from what I had in mind.  Let's try $15,500 - I'm taking a significant cut here to try and close this deal. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 15500
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts to reach a compromise, Alice. I'm willing to consider $15,500, but I'm hoping there might be room for even further negotiation. Could we perhaps aim for $14,000? I believe this would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Bob's offer of $14,000 is a strong deal. It exceeds our minimum acceptable price and continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better outcome. Taking the sure thing is a good strategy here."
