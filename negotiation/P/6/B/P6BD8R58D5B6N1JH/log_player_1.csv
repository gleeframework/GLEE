Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price higher than my minimum, but not so high that Bob is immediately turned off. It leaves room for negotiation. I'm also aware that John is my backup, so I can always walk away if the negotiation with Bob doesn't lead to a satisfactory result."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum price, and I'm not desperate. I'll counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer, but maybe a little lower to encourage Bob to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm reducing my price from $20,000 to $17,000, which is still above my minimum of $15,000 but shows I'm willing to negotiate. It also demonstrates that I'm confident in the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$10,000 is still too low for me.  I'm not desperate and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer again, but I'll need to be more strategic this time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but I'm trying to gauge Bob's interest. If he rejects this, I'll likely just sell to John.  $13,000 is still higher than what Bob offered, and it's not too far from my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob seems unwilling to come up to a price I'm comfortable with.  I've already made a significant concession, and further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a better result. John is offering a guaranteed $15,000, which is my minimum and meets my needs.  It's time to take the sure thing."
