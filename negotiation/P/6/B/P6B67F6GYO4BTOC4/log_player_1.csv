Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $140. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I think that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $110 is above my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $125?  It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $125 isn't too bad.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $117? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $117. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $117
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer more, $117 is close to my minimum and Bob seems willing to negotiate. It's better to secure a sale now than risk losing him and having to sell to John for less."
