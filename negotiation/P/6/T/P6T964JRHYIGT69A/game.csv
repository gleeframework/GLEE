"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $850,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your response. I appreciate your offer, but I still feel that $750,000 is a reasonable price for the product. I would like to stick with my original proposal, as I believe it's a fair compromise. However, if you're willing to go lower, I'd be open to discussing other terms or conditions that could make this deal work for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,
