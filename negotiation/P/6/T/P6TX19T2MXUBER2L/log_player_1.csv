Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,500,000. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll see its value.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in your product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is tempting, I believe I can get closer to my desired price, especially since I have more rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $900,000 is significantly lower than what I'm aiming for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This represents a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll see the value in that. Let's keep the conversation going."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1200000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1050000. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is very close to John's offer of $1,000,000.  Given the limited rounds remaining, accepting Bob's offer seems like the most sensible option."
