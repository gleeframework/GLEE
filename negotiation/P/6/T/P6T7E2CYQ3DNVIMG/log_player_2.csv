I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above my maximum price.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price, as there's still room for both of us to make a profit."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum price, but we're getting closer. I'm going to make another counteroffer in the hopes of closing the gap further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,250,000 is your top limit, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $1,300,000. This is my final offer. It's a great price for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,300,000 is still above my maximum of $1,200,000.  At this point, I'm better off buying the product from John for my target price. There's no guarantee that Alice will budge further, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the opportunity to get the product at a price I'm comfortable with."
