"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you have a budget. While I can't go as low as $120, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $145? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know your thoughts.",145.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet in the middle of $120 and $145, which would be $132.50? Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",132.5,Bob,4,
