Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with my absolute minimum, as I know I can get this price from John if Bob rejects. This sets the stage for negotiation and gives me the strongest position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's higher than his initial valuation, it's still below my minimum.  I have a strong position knowing I can sell to John for $1,500,000. I'll counter and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,400,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still above Bob's initial counteroffer.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not desperate to sell."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is getting too low for my liking. I'm not willing to go lower than $1,400,000, and it seems he's not willing to go higher than $1,100,000. To maximize my profit, I'll sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
