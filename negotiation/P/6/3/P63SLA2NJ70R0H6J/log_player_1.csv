Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $80. Would you be willing to lower the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $80 is better than nothing, it's still far below what the product is worth to me. I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $95. This is still a great price for a product of this quality."", ""product_price"": 95}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  He's not budging from his $80 price, and while I'm getting closer to my minimum of $120, I'm still not at a point where I feel comfortable selling the product for this price. I'm going to try to negotiate further."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $120. While I'm close to a deal with Bob, I'm running out of rounds, and it seems like he's not willing to budge much further. It's not worth risking the deal falling apart and ending up with nothing.  John's offer guarantees me my minimum desired price, so I'm going to take it."
