"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $8500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  $8500 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about $9250?  I'm willing to split the difference a bit to see if we can come to an agreement.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to come down a bit, but $9250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9000.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
