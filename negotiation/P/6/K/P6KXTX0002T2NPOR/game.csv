"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something you could utilize for [briefly mention potential benefits for Bob], and it's worth at least $1,200,000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that's fair for both of us, $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from its true potential value. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
