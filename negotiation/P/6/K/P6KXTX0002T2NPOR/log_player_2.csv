"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something you could utilize for [briefly mention potential benefits for Bob], and it's worth at least $1,200,000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that's fair for both of us, $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from its true potential value. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is less than your maximum budget, it's still significantly higher than John's offer of $1,200,000.  There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this initial offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better deal. This might encourage her to lower the price closer to her own valuation of $800,000."
