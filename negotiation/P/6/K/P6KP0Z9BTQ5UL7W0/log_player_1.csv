**Reasoning:**

While I could push for a bit more, accepting $13,000 makes sense at this point.  Here's why:

* **Time Value of Money:**  Getting paid now is better than potentially getting paid more later (with John). There's always a risk that something could change.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Dragging this out further might frustrate Bob and make him less willing to negotiate.
* **Profitable Deal:**  $13,000 is still a significant profit over Bob's initial offer and a decent return overall. 

It's a good balance between maximizing profit and ensuring a successful sale."
