"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be perfect for you.  Given its value, I'm asking for $22,000. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $22,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $8,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle. However, $18,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be honest, $11,000 is cutting it close, but I'm willing to accept $16,000 to close this deal quickly. This is my final offer.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for understanding. I appreciate the movement you've made. While $16,000 is still a bit more than I hoped to spend, I'm willing to go up to $12,000 to try and wrap this up.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting close. I'm willing to come down slightly to $14,500.  This is a significant discount and I need to finalize this soon.",14500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we split the difference and settle at $13,000? That's a fair offer, and it would allow us to close this out today.",13000.0,Bob,8,
