Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire it before it's offered elsewhere. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, I want to start negotiations significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000). 
* **Room for negotiation:** The offer of $1,300,000 leaves some space for Bob to negotiate, making him feel more in control of the process. 
* **Value-focused message:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob specifically, rather than focusing solely on the price. 
* **Time pressure:**  Hinting that the product might be ""offered elsewhere"" creates a subtle sense of urgency, potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly. 
 
This strategy aims to maximize profit while still leaving a chance for Bob to accept a price that's significantly higher than his initial valuation."
