"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, it's still below the value I'd like to get. I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a higher price before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to you. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $1,350,000 is a compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $1,275,000. This is the highest I can go. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I still believe I can negotiate a higher amount.  I'll counteroffer again, aiming to get closer to my initial asking price.  It's better to try and get a better deal than to settle for the bare minimum right now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,275,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000. This is a good compromise, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $1,325,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'll try to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $1,300,000. This is the highest I can go. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is very close to my desired price. It's getting late in the negotiation, and I risk losing the deal altogether if I reject it.  With only 4 rounds left, it's safer to accept and secure a good price."
