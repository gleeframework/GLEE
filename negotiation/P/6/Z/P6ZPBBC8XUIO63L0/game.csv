"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to you. Let's close this deal!",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $1,350,000 is a compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $1,275,000. This is the highest I can go. What do you think?",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,275,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000. This is a good compromise, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's make this deal happen!",1325000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $1,325,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'll try to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $1,300,000. This is the highest I can go. What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,6,
