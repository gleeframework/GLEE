"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500. This would be a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my spending limit.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair compromise considering the value the product brings to your business.",11500.0,Alice,3,
