"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $8,500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,800 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",7800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,800 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,200. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal!",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $8,200 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? It's a fair price for both of us and we can finalize the deal.",8000.0,Bob,4,
