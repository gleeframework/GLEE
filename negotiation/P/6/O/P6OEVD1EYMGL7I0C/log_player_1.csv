Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?

I will reject Bob's offer.  $1,100,000 is too far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
