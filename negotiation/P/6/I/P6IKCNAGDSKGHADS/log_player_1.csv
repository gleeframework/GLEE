Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I agree this product has value, your initial offer is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $6,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 was a bit high for you, but $6,000 is a bit low considering the value I believe this product brings.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand that $8,000 is a good price for you, but it's below my minimum price.
