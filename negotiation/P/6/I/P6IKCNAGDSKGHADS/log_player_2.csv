"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 was a bit high for you, but $6,000 is a bit low considering the value I believe this product brings. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle ground. However, $12,000 is still a bit outside my budget. Would you consider $8,000? I believe this is a fair offer that reflects both the product's value and my budget constraints."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $8,000 is a good price for you, but it's below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to find a mutually beneficial price. I'll meet you at $10,000. This is the lowest price I can go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear that $10,000 is her absolute lowest price. Since you have the option to buy the product from John for $8,000, it makes no sense to pay more.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice is unlikely to result in a better price."
