Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get the product for a bit closer to my budget. Given the value we both agree on, I'm willing to offer $650,000. This would still leave you with a good profit, and it would allow me to acquire the product within my financial limits.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
