"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a price of $12,000. I think it's a great value and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $8,000.  It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're on a budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,000 is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than my maximum budget.  I'm willing to take another round to see if we can get closer to my price point."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,500?  I'm really interested in this product and I think this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $10,500? I'm willing to make a slight concession to get a deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still higher than my maximum budget of $8,000.  At this point, it's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $8,000, as I'm unlikely to get Alice to come down any further."
