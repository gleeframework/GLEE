"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate it, but $135 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be happy to pay $125 for the product. What do you think?",125.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $125 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $130?  It's still a great price for a fantastic product!",130.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $130 is still a bit more than I can comfortably pay right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $127.50?  It's a fair price for both of us.",127.5,Bob,4,
