"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $135. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $135 is a good price, Bob can potentially get a better deal. He should try to negotiate with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate it, but $135 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be happy to pay $125 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the price closer to his maximum value of $120. Offering $125 is a reasonable counteroffer that shows he's serious about buying the product but still wants a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $125 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $130?  It's still a great price for a fantastic product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to his maximum value of $120. While $130 is a good price, he's not ready to accept it yet. He can try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $130 is still a bit more than I can comfortably pay right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $127.50?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 127.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a compromise by splitting the difference between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer. This shows good faith and an attempt to reach an agreement. It also keeps him within his budget while potentially securing a deal."
