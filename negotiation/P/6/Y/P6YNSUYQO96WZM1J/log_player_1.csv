Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,500 is way out of my price range. I'm interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $10,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I can accept. This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it's worth a substantial investment. How about we meet halfway at $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17,000 is still beyond what I can afford.  I'm sticking to my offer of $10,000.  It's a fair price considering the value I place on this product.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. However, $14,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking to my offer of $10,000. It's the highest I can go, and it's a fair price for the value I'm getting. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Bob is clearly unwilling to budge from his $10,000 offer.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a significantly better outcome. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
