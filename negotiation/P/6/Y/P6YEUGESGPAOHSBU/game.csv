"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I have to make a profit, and $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $7,500. This is my final offer for now, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",7500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $6,750. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $7,200. This is a fair price, considering the value the product brings to you.",7200.0,Alice,5,
