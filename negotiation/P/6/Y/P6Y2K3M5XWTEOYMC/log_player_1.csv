Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value and the potential benefits it can offer your business. I'm confident you'll find this to be a great deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still within a range where he might be willing to negotiate. 
* **Appealing to Value:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair price"" and highlighting the potential benefits to Bob, making it more tempting. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This offer provides room for Bob to counteroffer, potentially leading to a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Plan B:** I'm aware that John is a backup option, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob's counteroffers aren't satisfactory."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only able to offer $950,000 at this time.  It's a significant amount, and I believe it's a fair price considering my needs and the market value.  Let me know if you're willing to work with me on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $950,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, I'm willing to continue negotiating. There's still a chance to reach a compromise.
* **John as a safety net:** Knowing I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,500,000 gives me the leverage to hold out for a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is unfortunately too far below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm making a slight concession from my previous offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Justifying the price:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product and the potential benefits, reinforcing the worth of my counteroffer.
* **Room for negotiation:** I'm leaving room for further discussion, allowing Bob to make another counteroffer if necessary.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  My counteroffer is still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer, demonstrating my bargaining power and my willingness to walk away if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford right now. I'm willing to go to $1,050,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial solution. Let's see if we can close the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:** There's still room for negotiation.  I believe I can push for a higher price.
* **John as a safety net:** I'm confident I can get a better deal, but if not, John's offer is always a secure backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your situation, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me. Given the value of this product and the potential benefits it offers, I'm willing to go down to $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1075000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** I'm making a small concession from my previous offer, but still maintaining a price above Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate without significantly compromising my desired outcome.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm again reminding Bob of the product's value and potential benefits, justifying my price. 
* **Final Offer Stance:** I'm positioning this offer as a ""fair compromise"" and ""a price we can both be happy with,"" implying that I'm getting close to my limit.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  While I'm making a small concession, I'm not giving in completely. My price is still significantly higher than Bob's, and I have John's offer as a backup if negotiations fail."
