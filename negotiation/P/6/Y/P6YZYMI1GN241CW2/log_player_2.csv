"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate.  I'm asking for $100 for it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is less than your maximum budget, there's a chance Alice might offer a lower price if you reject her initial offer. It's worth seeing if you can get a better deal before resorting to buying from John for $120."
