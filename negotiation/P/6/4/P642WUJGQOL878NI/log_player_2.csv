The product is worth $8,000 to you, and Alice is offering it for $12,000. This is significantly higher than your budget. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

While $11,000 is closer to your budget, it's still more than you're willing to spend.  It's worth trying to negotiate further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm confident that's a fair price, and I'm eager to finalize the sale.

```

While $10,500 is getting close to your ideal price, it's still slightly more than you're comfortable with.  Since John is selling the product for $8,000, it's more beneficial to purchase from John and save yourself the extra $2,500."
