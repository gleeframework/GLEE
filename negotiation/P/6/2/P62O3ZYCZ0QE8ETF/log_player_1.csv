Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,250,000, which is halfway between Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. 
* **Positive Framing:** My message is positive and emphasizes the benefit to Bob. 
* **Flexibility:** I'm prepared to negotiate, but I'm also ready to walk away and get my desired price from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $1,250,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I want to make a deal with Bob, I won't accept a price that's so far below my value.  I'll counter with a higher price to see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a counter-offer that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still holding firm on my minimum value.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm reminding Bob that my offer is still a good deal for him.
* **Clear Expectations:** I'm communicating that I'm not willing to go lower than $1,000,000."
