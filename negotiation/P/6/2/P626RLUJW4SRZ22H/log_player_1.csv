Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $100 is more than your minimum of $80, so you'll be making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $100 is less than what the product is worth to Bob ($120), giving him incentive to negotiate.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Both of you have room to bargain and find a price that works for both."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, Bob's offer of $90 is still above my minimum of $80.  It's a decent deal and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a lower price or a sale to John for less."
