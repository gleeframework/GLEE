"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a highly valuable product for a competitive price. I'm confident this product can be a game-changer for you. My offer is $1200000.  Let's discuss how this can benefit your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still higher than Bob's desired maximum of $1,500,000. Therefore, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer gives Bob the opportunity to potentially get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This price still offers significant value to you while ensuring I can maintain a fair profit. Let's make this deal work for both of us.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is closer to Bob's desired price range, it's still higher than his ideal target.  Bob can potentially get a better price by continuing to negotiate, as Alice has already shown a willingness to compromise."

How about $1,050,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to stay within my budget and allowing you to make a profit.
