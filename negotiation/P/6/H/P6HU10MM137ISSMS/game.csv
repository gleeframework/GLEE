"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is too high for me.  I'm interested, but only if we can agree on a price that works for both of us. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  I can do $7,000.  That's a significant price, and I'm ready to make a deal if you are.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to compromise further and offer $8,200. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8200.0,Alice,5,
