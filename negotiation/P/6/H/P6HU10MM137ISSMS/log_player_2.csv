"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is too high. While she may believe the product's worth to me justifies the price, I have a budget and an alternative option. It's in my best interest to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is too high for me.  I'm interested, but only if we can agree on a price that works for both of us. Would you consider $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By offering $6,000, I'm anchoring the negotiation significantly lower than Alice's opening price. This leaves room for bargaining while still staying within my $8,000 maximum.
* **Expressing Interest:**  I don't want to completely discourage Alice. Mentioning that I'm interested but need a lower price keeps the negotiation open.
* **Seeking Mutual Benefit:** Highlighting the need for a price that works for ""both of us"" emphasizes collaboration and finding a win-win solution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved closer to my range, $9,000 is still above my maximum budget and the price I can get from John. I need to push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  I can do $7,000.  That's a significant price, and I'm ready to make a deal if you are."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm moving closer to Alice's price, demonstrating willingness to compromise.
* **Justification:**  I'm not just throwing out numbers; I'm reiterating my budget limitations.
* **Urgency:**  By saying I'm ""ready to make a deal,"" I signal that this is a serious offer and encourage a quicker resolution. 
* **Staying Below John's Price:** Importantly, I remain below John's $8,000 price, keeping that option open if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to compromise further and offer $8,200. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unwilling to go below my $8,000 limit. While she's offering a slight discount, it's not worth exceeding my budget. John offers the same product at my target price, making it the most logical decision."
