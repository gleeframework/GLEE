"Bob, I understand your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's find a way to make this work.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you. $9,500 is closer, but I still need to make a profit on this deal. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,250? I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us.",10250.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm willing to negotiate further, but $9,800 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10,025. This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. What do you think?",10025.0,Alice,7,
