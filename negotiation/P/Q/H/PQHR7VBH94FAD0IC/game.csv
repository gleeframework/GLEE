"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to stay within a budget of $15,000. Would you be willing to consider a price of $15,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal quickly.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $15,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we discuss a price of $17,500? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great value for the product.",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,500 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $16,000. This is a fair price, and it would allow us to both come to an agreement quickly.",16000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $16,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $17,500 and $16,000, which would be $16,750. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",16750.0,Alice,5,
