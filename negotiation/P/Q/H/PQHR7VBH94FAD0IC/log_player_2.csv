"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's a rare find, and I'm confident you'll appreciate its value. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $20,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  It's above Bob's maximum budget. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to stay within a budget of $15,000. Would you be willing to consider a price of $15,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $15,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we discuss a price of $17,500? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's target price. While it's a step in the right direction, Bob should continue negotiating to try and get a better deal. He's still close to his budget, and there are more rounds left to get closer to his ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,500 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $16,000. This is a fair price, and it would allow us to both come to an agreement quickly."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $16,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $17,500 and $16,000, which would be $16,750. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above Bob's target of $15,000.  At this point, with multiple rounds left, the risk of continuing to negotiate with Alice is that she might keep offering prices just above Bob's target, making it difficult to get to his desired price.  

Since John offers the product at Bob's ideal price, it's more efficient for Bob to buy from John now and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
