Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $10,000, which is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially earn more.
* **Positive Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and positive, hoping to establish a good rapport with Bob and encourage him to consider the offer.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** I'll wait for Bob's response. If he accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a counteroffer of my own.
* **John's Option:**  If the negotiation with Bob stalls, I have the option to sell to John for $8,000, guaranteeing a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd ideally like to earn more, accepting his offer guarantees me a sale and prevents the risk of further negotiation that could lead to a lower price or a failed sale."
