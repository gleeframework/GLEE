"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a unique and lucrative investment for you. As we're just starting our negotiation, I'm willing to make a fair and competitive offer. I'm proposing to sell the product to you for $700,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm confident we can work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",700000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm hoping to secure a slightly better price. Would you consider $550,000?",550000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to negotiate the price, but I'm afraid $550,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm proposing to sell the product to you for $675,000. This is a reasonable compromise, taking into account the value you've placed on the product.",675000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $675,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm aiming for something closer to $600,000. Would you be open to $610,000?",610000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $610,000 is still a bit below my target. Considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm proposing to sell the product to you for $650,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the value you've placed on the product.",650000.0,Alice,5,
