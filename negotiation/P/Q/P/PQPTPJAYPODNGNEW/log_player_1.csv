Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm asking for $140 for it, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  $140 is above your minimum of $120, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  $140 is below Bob's perceived value of $150, giving him room to negotiate and potentially feel like he's getting a good deal. 

This strategy leaves room for negotiation and gives you a good starting point to maximize your profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $130 is still above your minimum acceptable price of $120. While you could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee you'll get a better price from Bob, and there's a risk he might walk away entirely. 

Selling to John for $120 would only be a better option if you were certain you couldn't get a higher price from Bob. Since there's still potential for negotiation and Bob's offer is reasonable, accepting his offer is the best strategy to maximize your profit."
