"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to me is at least $800000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in, and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is significantly lower than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  It's worth trying to get a better price by making a counteroffer.  We can leverage Alice's stated value of $800,000 to try and get a deal closer to that range."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $850000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $875000. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. Let me know if this is something you're interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is a significant improvement from her initial price and gets us closer to our desired price range.  While we could continue negotiating, the risk of her rejecting our offer again and potentially raising her price exists. It's also important to remember that buying from John would cost us $1,200,000. Accepting Alice's offer saves us $325,000 compared to buying from John."
