"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This is my best offer, but I'm open to further discussion.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,175,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,175,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000.  This is a substantial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I'm willing to consider it. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $1,125,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair considering the product's value. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,125,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000, which is my absolute maximum. I believe this offer is fair, considering the product's value and my budget. I hope we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a balance between your budget and the product's value. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to meet you at $1,120,000, which is still slightly above your maximum offer. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and your budget.
