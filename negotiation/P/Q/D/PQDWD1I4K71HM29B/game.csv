"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm only making it to you because I think you're a serious buyer. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. Would you be willing to consider $1200000? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1350000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1350000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1250000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're willing to invest in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1250000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $1300000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.
