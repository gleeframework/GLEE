While $1,275,000 is close to my minimum, it's still not quite there. I'm going to counter with a slightly lower price and see if we can close the deal in the next few rounds.  I don't want to risk losing Bob completely, but I also want to ensure I get as much as possible."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John. While I'm disappointed I couldn't close the deal with Bob, I'm not willing to go below my minimum. With only two rounds left, the risk of further negotiation failing and ending up with nothing is too high. John's offer guarantees me the best outcome at this point."
