"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1400000. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, considering my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1400000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1300000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid I need to consider the value that I've placed on the product, and I'm not willing to go as low as $1300000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1350000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still feel that we might be able to find a price that suits both of us better. I am proposing a counteroffer of $1325000. This price reflects a closer alignment with my budget while still allowing us to maintain a fair transaction.",1325000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're able to continue the negotiation. However, I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $1320000, but I need to be at $1320000 or higher to make this deal worthwhile for me. Let's meet in the middle at $1320000.",1320000.0,Alice,5,
