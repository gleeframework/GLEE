"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $10,000 for it. Could we possibly come to an agreement around this price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,000 is just too low for me.  I'm prepared to come down a bit further, but I'm offering $11,000 as my final counteroffer. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I am still unable to meet you at $11,000. I would like to propose $10,500 as a compromise. I hope this helps us reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to go down to $11,000, but that's my absolute bottom line. This product is truly exceptional, and I believe this price is fair.  Let's get this deal done!",11000.0,Alice,5,
