{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it.  I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is slightly above Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation if he rejects it. It's a good starting point to see if Bob is interested in the product and if he's willing to pay a price closer to your desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired value of $150.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him closer to my price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer, I'm looking for something closer to $120. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value this product offers. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $100 is a more reasonable price for it. Can you meet me at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $110 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum threshold of $150. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him closer to my price point with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I really appreciate your persistence.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $115 is my final offer.  This is a great deal for a product of this quality. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 115} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I've been thinking about it and I'm not willing to go above $110. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is unwilling to budge on his price, and I'm starting to get the feeling this negotiation is going nowhere. I've already made several concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower than my minimum desired value. I'm going to take the guaranteed $150 from John instead of risking a further decrease in price with Bob."
