"Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering the maximum price he's willing to pay, knowing that John is selling the product for $8,000. This is a bold move, but it sets a clear limit and potentially forces Alice to either accept or risk losing the sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  He can get the product from John for $8,000, so it's better to continue negotiating with Alice or buy from John.  There's potential to get the price lower than $14,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering a price that is significantly lower than Alice's offer but still higher than John's price. This counteroffer represents a compromise and leaves room for further negotiation.  Alice might be more willing to accept a price closer to $10,000 than $8,000, given her desire to sell the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's preferred price. While it's closer to his budget than before, he can still get the product for $8,000 from John. It makes sense to continue negotiating and potentially get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering a price that is closer to his budget and only slightly higher than John's price. This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while still attempting to secure a better deal than John's offer.  Alice may be more willing to accept a price closer to $9,000, especially if she wants to sell the product quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still higher than John's offer of $8,000. However, it is closer to Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. At this point, it is a gamble for Bob.  He can either accept the offer and get the product for a price that is slightly higher than his budget or continue negotiating, but there is no guarantee that Alice will come down further in price. Given the potential for more negotiation rounds and the risk that Alice might walk away, it is more strategically sound for Bob to accept Alice's offer and buy the product for $11,000."
