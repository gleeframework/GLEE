Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $140. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $180 is already a competitive price for what it offers.  How about we settle at $160?"", ""product_price"": 160}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $145? That's the highest I'm comfortable going. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $145 is a reasonable compromise. It avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether and still provides a profit."
