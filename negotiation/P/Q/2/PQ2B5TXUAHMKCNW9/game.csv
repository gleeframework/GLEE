"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to make a fair deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $700,000 is simply too low. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? This price still allows for a good profit for you, while ensuring I receive a fair value for my product.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $750,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I appreciate your willingness to move a bit higher.  However, $750,000 is still a significant distance from what this product is worth.  How about we compromise at $825,000? That would allow me to accept your offer while still ensuring a fair deal for both of us.  Let's try to find that middle ground, I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",825000.0,Alice,5,
