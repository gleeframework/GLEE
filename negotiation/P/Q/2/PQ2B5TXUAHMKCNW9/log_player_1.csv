Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $900,000, which is a significant amount for Bob but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** This price allows for some back-and-forth, as it's not my absolute minimum.
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $1,000,000 gives me confidence in my negotiating position. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer. If it's close to my minimum (around $900,000), I might accept.
* If Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower, I'll make a counteroffer closer to my starting price. 
* I'll keep John's offer in mind to determine when it's more beneficial to stop negotiating with Bob and take the guaranteed $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to make a fair deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $700,000 is significantly below my minimum of $1,000,000, and even below the $900,000 I initially offered. It's clear Bob is trying to lowball me.
* **Negotiation Potential:** While $700,000 is not acceptable, there's still room for negotiation. I can likely get a higher price by making a counteroffer. 
* **John's Offer as Leverage:** Knowing John is willing to pay $1,000,000 gives me the upper hand in negotiation.  

**Next Steps:**

* I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $900,000. I might even try to meet him halfway at $800,000.
* If Bob continues to push for a much lower price, I'll likely stop the negotiation and sell to John to secure the guaranteed $1,000,000."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $700,000 is simply too low. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? This price still allows for a good profit for you, while ensuring I receive a fair value for my product.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  Offering $800,000 is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate. It's also a good starting point for further discussion.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing that even at $800,000, Bob is getting a good deal, which might make him more receptive.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** While I'm willing to negotiate, I haven't given in completely. I'm still above my minimum and John's offer remains a safety net.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll assess his counteroffer. If it's close to $800,000, I might accept.
* If Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower, I'll make another counteroffer closer to my starting price or consider selling to John. 
* I'll continue to monitor the situation, keeping John's offer in mind to determine when it's more advantageous to end the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $750,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is slightly higher than before, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** Bob is clearly interested in the product, and I believe there's still potential to get closer to my desired price.
* **John's Offer Provides Security:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $1,000,000 gives me confidence in rejecting Bob's offer, knowing I have a fallback option.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $900,000. I might try to meet him halfway again, at $825,000, or propose a price slightly above his offer.
* If Bob continues to push for a much lower price, I'll likely stop the negotiation and sell to John to secure the guaranteed $1,000,000. 
* I'll continue to monitor the situation, assessing Bob's willingness to negotiate and weighing the potential risk of losing the sale to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I appreciate your willingness to move a bit higher.  However, $750,000 is still a significant distance from what this product is worth.  How about we compromise at $825,000? That would allow me to accept your offer while still ensuring a fair deal for both of us.  Let's try to find that middle ground, I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway (Again):** Offering $825,000 demonstrates a continued willingness to negotiate while staying above my minimum. It's a reasonable midpoint between my last offer and his latest proposal.
* **Emphasizing Fair Deal:** I'm stressing the importance of finding a compromise that benefits both parties. This can make Bob more receptive to meeting in the middle.
* **Maintaining Confidence:** While I'm open to negotiation, I haven't given in completely. I'm still well above my minimum and John's offer remains a strong backup.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll carefully assess his counteroffer. If it's close to $825,000, I might accept.
* If Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower, I'll likely make a final counteroffer closer to my initial $900,000 or consider selling to John. 
* I'll continue to monitor the situation and weigh the potential risk of losing the sale to John against the possibility of securing a higher price from Bob."
