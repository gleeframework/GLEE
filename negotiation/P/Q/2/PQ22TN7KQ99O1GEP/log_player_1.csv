Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $119. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **John's Offer:**  John provides a safety net at $100 if Bob declines.

By offering the product at $119, you maximize your potential profit while staying below Bob's maximum valuation. This leaves Bob with a small gain ($1) and incentivizes him to accept the offer rather than risk missing out."
