You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is overpriced. While it's lower than John's price, it's still significantly higher than your maximum valuation ($15,000) and Alice's own perceived value ($10,000).  By rejecting this offer, you create an opportunity:

* **Potential for Negotiation:** Alice might be willing to lower the price further to avoid losing the sale.
* **Sticking to your Budget:** You remain within your budget and avoid overpaying."
