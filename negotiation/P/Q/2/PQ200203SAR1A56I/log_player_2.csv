"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity to experience something truly special. For this exceptional item, I propose a price of $120. I believe it reflects its value and uniqueness. Let me know if you're interested or if you have any questions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since your maximum budget is $120 and Alice is offering the product at $120, there's no incentive to negotiate. You can get the same product from John for the same price, so it makes sense to go with John."
