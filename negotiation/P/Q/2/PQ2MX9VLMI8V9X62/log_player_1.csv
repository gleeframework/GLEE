"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $9,500 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($8,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport.
* **Value Proposition:**  While I haven't explicitly stated the product's value to Bob, I'm hinting that it's something he might be interested in, potentially building curiosity. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to start the negotiation with a high offer and see if Bob is willing to bite. If not, I can gradually lower the price while keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price ($10,000).  I also want to remain open to Bob's counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price.  I'm going to try to get a bit closer to my target. 

**Strategy:**

* I'm confident that I can likely negotiate a higher price, especially since I have 8 rounds left and the option to sell to John for $10,000.  
* By rejecting Bob's offer, I can control the negotiation and make a counteroffer that aligns with my goal of getting closer to my desired price point."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $8,500 is a good starting point, I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.  How about $9,000?  This is a significant investment for you, and I want to make sure it's a win-win situation for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm not comfortable accepting it yet. 

**Strategy:**

* **Maintain Momentum:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue pushing for a better price, leveraging my position and the knowledge that I have an alternative buyer in John.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $9,200. This would be a good price for both of us, considering the value of the product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9200}
```

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $9,200 is the right price. How about $8,600? I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my target than his previous offers, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm not comfortable selling at this point.  I have John as a backup buyer, so I can afford to be more persistent in my negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm maintaining my leverage in the negotiation.  I can still push for a higher price, especially with my backup offer. 
* **Time is on My Side:**  I have 4 rounds left, and I can use this time to try and reach a more favorable agreement with Bob. 
* **Avoiding a ""Loss"":**  Accepting Bob's offer would result in a loss for me compared to selling to John.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to secure a better price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us, and I appreciate that. But $8,600 is still a bit too low for me.

Let's get this done."", ""product_price"": 9000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go back to $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,600 and $9,000, which would be $8,800. Can we agree on that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my target, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  With only two rounds left, the risk of not reaching a satisfactory deal with Bob is high.  Therefore, I'm going to sell to John for $10,000.

**Strategy:**

* **Time is Running Out:** With only two rounds remaining, the pressure is on to secure a deal. 
* **Guaranteed Outcome:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and a certain outcome.  
* **Risk Aversion:**  I'm prioritizing a guaranteed sale over the possibility of getting a slightly higher price from Bob with a high probability of failure."
