"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you. I'm offering you my [product name] at a price that I believe is fair and will provide significant value to your business.  I understand this product is worth a great deal to you, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.  Let's discuss a price of $950,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $950,000 is less than John's price of $1,000,000. 
* However, you have room to negotiate a better price with Alice since her product is only worth $800,000 to her. 
* By rejecting her initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a more competitive price, potentially pushing her to lower it closer to her valuation."
