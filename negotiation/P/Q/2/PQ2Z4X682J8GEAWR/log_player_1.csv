{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $1,150,000 is:
    *  Significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), leaving room for negotiation.
    *  Attractive enough that Bob might consider it a good deal if he highly values the product's unique aspects.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning other buyers creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a quicker decision.

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation:** This offer is a starting point.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Having John as a backup ensures we don't lose out if Bob rejects the offer."
