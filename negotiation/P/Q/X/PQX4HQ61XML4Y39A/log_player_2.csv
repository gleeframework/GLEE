"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is too high for me. I'm interested, but only if we can agree on a price closer to $8,000."", 
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

This counter-offer is a starting point for negotiation. Here's why:

* **Aggressive but within reason:**  It's significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it leaves room for negotiation.
* **Signals interest but sets a limit:**  The message expresses interest but clearly states that $8,000 is the desired price point.
* **Opens the door for Alice's response:** This offer encourages Alice to counter if she's truly motivated to sell."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $12,500. I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but she's still above our maximum budget and her product's worth to us. We need to push her further towards a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $12,500 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  Would you consider $9,500?  That would make this a viable deal for me."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Strategy:**

* **Acknowledgement:** We acknowledge Alice's willingness to negotiate, keeping the conversation positive.
* **Firm but fair:** We stand our ground that $12,500 is too high but offer a significant increase from our previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. 
* **Deadline Implied:**  We don't explicitly threaten to walk away, but our language (""viable deal"") subtly implies that we have other options if we can't reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here.  How about $11,000?  That's a significant reduction on my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

We're getting closer, but $11,000 is still above our budget and a significant markup from John's offer. It's time to nudge Alice closer to our range or consider John's offer seriously."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a price that works for both of us.  To be honest, $10,000 is the absolute maximum I'm willing to spend on this product.  If you're able to meet that price, I'm ready to close the deal."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Strategy:**

* **Final Offer:** We're laying our cards on the table.  This is our maximum budget and a firm offer.
* **Sense of Urgency:** We're signaling that this is our final offer, creating a sense of urgency for Alice to make a decision.
* **Prepared to Walk Away:**  We're mentally prepared to buy from John if Alice rejects this offer."
