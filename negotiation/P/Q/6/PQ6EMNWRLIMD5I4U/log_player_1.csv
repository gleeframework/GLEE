Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,150,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $1,150,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  The price is also below Bob's estimated value of $1,200,000, making it potentially attractive to him.
* **Friendly tone:** Using a polite and positive tone sets a good foundation for negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great!  I've successfully made a good profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a counter-counteroffer.  
* If the negotiations stall or become too time-consuming, I can always sell to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my ideal price:**  While $1,100,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price, I'd prefer to try and get closer to my initial asking price of $1,150,000.
* **Potential for higher profit:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I have the opportunity to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to my desired value. 
* **Not a significant difference:**  The difference between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer is relatively small.  There's a good chance I can convince him to come up slightly.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $1,150,000. 
* If Bob rejects again, I will need to weigh the potential of further negotiations against the risk of losing time and ultimately settling for a lower price.
*  If the negotiation stalls or becomes too time-consuming, I will consider selling to John for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While I appreciate your offer, I'm not quite ready to settle at $1,100,000.  Would you consider $1,125,000?  This price is still within a reasonable range for both of us, and it allows for a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering strategically:**  My counteroffer of $1,125,000 is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but also value the product.
* **Finding a middle ground:** The price is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, which could appeal to his sense of fairness.
* **Staying firm:** I'm not willing to drop below $1,100,000 at this point. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've successfully secured a good deal.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll need to assess the situation.  If he's unwilling to budge, I might consider selling to John for $1,000,000 to avoid further negotiation. 
* **If Bob counteroffers again:** I will analyze his offer and decide whether to accept it or make another counteroffer.  I need to balance the desire for a higher price with the potential of losing the deal."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
