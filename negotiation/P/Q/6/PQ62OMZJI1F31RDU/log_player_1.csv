I'm starting with a price of $1,300,000. This gives Bob a bit of room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit beyond my minimum value.  If he rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter with a new offer, or sell to John for my guaranteed $1,200,000."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is below my minimum value of $1,200,000.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a new price. I'll try to find a price that's still attractive to Bob but closer to my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering with $1,250,000. This is a compromise â€“ it's higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my initial offer. I'm hoping this price will be appealing enough for Bob to accept while ensuring I get a profit."
