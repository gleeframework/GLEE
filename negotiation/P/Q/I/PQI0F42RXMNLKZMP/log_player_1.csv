{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  This is my initial offer, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:**  I'm focusing on the benefits for both of us to encourage a positive response.
* **Room for negotiation:** This price gives me room to lower the price if necessary, without dropping below my minimum value. 
* **John as backup:**  Having John as a backup buyer gives me confidence to walk away from a deal that doesn't meet my minimum requirements."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in your product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you $850,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While it's closer to my target, $850,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation potential:** I still have room to negotiate with Bob. I can make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **John provides a safety net:** Knowing I can sell to John for $1,000,000 allows me to be more assertive in the negotiation and not settle for a price that's too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This reflects the value of the product and leaves some room for both of us to feel good about the deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** While I rejected Bob's offer, I'm demonstrating flexibility by coming down from my initial price.
* **Maintaining value:**  My counteroffer is still significantly higher than Bob's last offer, reflecting the product's value and my minimum acceptable price.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm keeping the communication positive, emphasizing a collaborative approach to finding a solution.
* **Building towards an agreement:** I'm hoping this counteroffer will lead to a quicker agreement, rather than prolonged negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll offer you $925,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $925,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Final offer:** Bob has stated this is his final offer, and further negotiation may not be fruitful.
* **Time and effort:** Continuing to negotiate could be time-consuming and potentially lead to a lower final price. 
* **John's offer as a safety net:** I still have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 if this deal falls through. 

By accepting Bob's offer, I can secure a sale that is relatively close to my minimum and avoid the risk of further negotiation, potentially resulting in a lower price."
