"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, and you know John is willing to sell for $150, it's the most logical choice to buy from John immediately. There's no guarantee you'll be able to get a lower price from Alice."
