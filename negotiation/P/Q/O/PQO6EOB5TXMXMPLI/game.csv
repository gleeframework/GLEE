"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we discuss the price, I'd like to start with an offer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product. However, $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it, which is still a great deal for you. Let's see if we can work something out.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking for a better deal. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new offer of $850,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit on the price. I'm still not quite there though. I'm willing to go up to $800,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,4,
