"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000.  It's a valuable asset with a lot of potential, and I believe this price reflects that.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm opening with a high price to leave room for negotiation.  
* **Focus on value:** My message emphasizes the potential of the product to entice Bob.
* **Room for compromise:** The price is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, leaving room for compromise without compromising my bottom line."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $2,000,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. This seems to be a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my financial situation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is a significant step down from my initial offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Opportunity for a better price:** I believe I can still get a better price from Bob, or at least get closer to my target price.
* **Risk vs. reward:**  While selling to John guarantees $1,500,000, there's a chance I could negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round.  The potential for a higher return outweighs the risk of losing the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your financial situation, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000, which still allows me to make a reasonable profit while offering you a fair price. Let's see if we can find some common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** This counteroffer shows I'm willing to negotiate, but it still keeps me above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlighting the value:**  I reiterate that the product is valuable and that this price is fair for both parties.
* **Setting a clear expectation:** I'm making it clear that this is a reasonable compromise, and that I'm not likely to go lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my assessment, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget constraints. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price. 
* **No need to risk further negotiation:**  While I might be able to squeeze out a slightly higher price, the risk of further negotiation is not worth it. There's a chance Bob could reject my counteroffer, and I'd be left with less than my minimum. 
* **Secure deal:** Accepting this offer guarantees a sale and a good return on the product."
