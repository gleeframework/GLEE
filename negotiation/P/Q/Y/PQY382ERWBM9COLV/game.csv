"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000.  It's a valuable asset with a lot of potential, and I believe this price reflects that.  Let me know what you think.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $2,000,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. This seems to be a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my financial situation.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your financial situation, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000, which still allows me to make a reasonable profit while offering you a fair price. Let's see if we can find some common ground here.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my assessment, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget constraints. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
