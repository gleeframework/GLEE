"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $15000. Would it be possible for you to consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","I'd like to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. Since Bob is willing to go up to $10,000, I'll try to meet him in the middle and make a counteroffer of $12,500. This way, I'm still making a profit, but I'm also showing Bob that I'm willing to be flexible and compromise.
