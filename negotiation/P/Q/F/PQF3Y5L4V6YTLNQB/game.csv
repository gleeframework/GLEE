,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer Alice, but $18000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $12000 at this time.  Let me know if you're willing to negotiate.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $16000. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet at $14000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm now offering the product to you for $15500. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you're willing to pay and my minimum acceptable price.",15500.0,Alice,5,
