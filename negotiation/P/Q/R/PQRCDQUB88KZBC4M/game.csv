"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity that I think you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800000.

"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm afraid I can't accept $700000. I'm willing to compromise, though! I'm thinking of a price of $850000. This is a fair middle ground considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $850000. I'm thinking of a price of $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though! I'm thinking of a price of $825000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $825000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking of a price of $775000. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to listen. However, $775000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $800000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to listen, Alice, but I'm afraid $800000 is still not a good fit for me. I'm willing to make a final counteroffer, and I'm thinking of a price of $780000. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",780000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand your final offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $780000 is still not enough for me to accept. I've already compromised a lot, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to make one more offer, and I'm thinking of a price of $795000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to negotiate further. What do you think?",795000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm afraid $795000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one last attempt to find a deal, and I'm thinking of a price of $785000. I'm trying to find a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",785000.0,Bob,10,
