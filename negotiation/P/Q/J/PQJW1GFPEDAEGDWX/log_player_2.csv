"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to own a unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,350,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $1,350,000 is still significantly more than Alice's perceived value of $1,000,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.**  Bob can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer.  
* **John's offer is a backup.**  Bob has a fallback option of buying from John, but this is only used if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,350,000 is a bit too high for me at the moment.  Given the product's value, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is significantly lower.**  This price is closer to Alice's perceived value of $1,000,000, but still leaves room for potential negotiation.
* **Fair and reasonable offer.**  The counteroffer attempts to find a middle ground, showing Bob's willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a good deal. 
* **Focuses on value.**  The message highlights the product's value to both parties, emphasizing a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,100,000 is a tempting offer, I believe the product's true value is closer to my initial asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still too high.** While it's closer to Bob's initial counteroffer, $1,225,000 is still above Bob's target price and significantly higher than Alice's perceived value. 
* **There's still room for negotiation.**  Bob can continue to push for a lower price.  
* **John's offer is a fallback.**  Bob should continue to try to get a better deal from Alice before resorting to John's offer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $1,225,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This represents a fair compromise that's closer to my initial offer and still allows you to get a good price for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small increment:**  The counteroffer increases Bob's offer by a smaller amount, demonstrating a willingness to compromise without conceding too much.
* **Focus on compromise:** The message emphasizes a desire for a mutually acceptable solution.
* **Maintains a target price:**  $1,150,000 is still well below Bob's maximum budget, leaving some room for further negotiation if needed."
