"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. However, $1,000,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  This product holds significant value, which is why I'm proposing $1,600,000. This offer reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your latest proposal. While I understand the value of the product, I must respectfully decline the offer at $1,600,000. My budget is firmly set at $800,000, which is the maximum amount I am willing to spend on this product. I hope we can come to an agreement that respects both our financial limits.",800000.0,Bob,4,
