"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,800,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with an offer above your desired outcome. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""immense value and potential,"" we aim to anchor Bob's perception of the product's worth at a higher level. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to engage in a dialogue and signals your willingness to negotiate.

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while still leaving space for a mutually beneficial agreement within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a price of $1,000,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than our minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). While his counteroffer shows some willingness to negotiate, accepting at this stage would leave a substantial amount of money on the table. We have room to negotiate and would be better off seeing if we can bring him closer to our desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. However, $1,000,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  This product holds significant value, which is why I'm proposing $1,600,000. This offer reflects the true worth of what's being offered."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge and Counter:** We acknowledge Bob's offer but stand firm that it's too low. 
* **Step Down, But Hold Value:**  We decrease our price by $200,000, signaling a willingness to negotiate but not a desperation to sell at any cost. 
* **Reiterate Value:** We continue to emphasize the product's value to justify the high price.

We're still in the early rounds, and this strategy keeps the negotiation moving while aiming for a much higher final price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your latest proposal. While I understand the value of the product, I must respectfully decline the offer at $1,600,000. My budget is firmly set at $800,000, which is the maximum amount I am willing to spend on this product. I hope we can come to an agreement that respects both our financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now revealed his absolute maximum budget, which is significantly lower than our minimum acceptable price. Further negotiation is unlikely to bridge this gap. We have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,200,000, which meets our requirements. It's time to cut our losses with Bob and secure the guaranteed sale to John."
