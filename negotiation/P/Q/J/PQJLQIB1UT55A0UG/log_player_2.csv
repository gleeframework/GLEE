"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you, for $14,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

While it's a bit above Alice's value, $14,000 is still less than your $15,000 maximum and saves you money compared to buying from John."
