"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? I'm confident this is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $8,750?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $9,000?  That's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it gives us both a good deal.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go up to $8,800, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",8800.0,Bob,6,
