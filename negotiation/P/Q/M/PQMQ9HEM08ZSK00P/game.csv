"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $70. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product. Let me know if you're willing to accept it or if you'd like to make a counteroffer of your own.",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $70 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85. This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still not comfortable paying $85 for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $77.50. I think that's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to accept it or if you'd like to make another counteroffer.",77.5,Bob,4,
