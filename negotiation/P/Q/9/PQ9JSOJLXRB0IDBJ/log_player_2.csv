Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

```

**Explanation:**

* Alice's offer of $13,500 is within your budget of $15,000. 
* While you might be able to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting your next offer and you having to buy from John at $15,000 outweighs the potential savings. 
* Accepting Alice's offer is the best option to ensure you get the product at a reasonable price."
