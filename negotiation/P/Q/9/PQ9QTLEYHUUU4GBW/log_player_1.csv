Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $11,500.  I think this is a fair price considering the benefits it offers. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing John will buy the product for $10,000 provides a safety net. Alice doesn't need to go below that price.

**Why this strategy works:**

This offer aims to capture the most value from Bob while still being appealing enough for him to accept. It leaves a small margin for negotiation but ensures Alice doesn't lose out on a significant profit."
