{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What do you think?"",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm looking to negotiate a better price. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. This is a fair price for both parties, and I believe it's a good starting point for further negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering my offer. While I understand your perspective, the $900,000 price point doesn't fully reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to move a bit from my initial offer, how about we settle at $1,050,000? This feels like a more agreeable compromise."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Considering the value you place on the product is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $950,000. This is a reasonable price considering the market value and the product's worth to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently trying to anchor the price around the midpoint between his valuation and my reserve price. While $950,000 is a decent offer, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. I'm willing to push a bit further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about $1,025,000? This represents a significant compromise on my part while acknowledging the value this product holds."",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Considering the value you place on the product is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $975,000. This is a reasonable price considering the market value and the product's worth to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is sticking to his pattern of splitting the difference.  We're getting close to the point where the potential gains from continuing to negotiate with Bob are outweighed by the risk of him walking away. I'll apply a little more pressure to see if I can budge him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, we're nearing the point where further negotiation might not be the most productive use of our time. My final offer is $1,010,000. This is my absolute best price, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a fair deal."",
""product_price"": 1010000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** It's time to signal to Bob that I'm reaching my limit. By presenting this as my ""final offer"" I'm hoping to nudge him towards a decision while still leaving a small margin for negotiation if he absolutely refuses to budge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're willing to make a final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one last counteroffer. Considering the value you place on the product is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $990,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has countered my ""final offer"" with his own, and while it's not ideal, it's close enough to warrant acceptance. Accepting $990,000 secures a significant profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away, ultimately leaving me with a worse outcome."
