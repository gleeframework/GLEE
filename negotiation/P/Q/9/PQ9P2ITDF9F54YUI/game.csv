"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm looking to negotiate a better price. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. This is a fair price for both parties, and I believe it's a good starting point for further negotiations.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering my offer. While I understand your perspective, the $900,000 price point doesn't fully reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to move a bit from my initial offer, how about we settle at $1,050,000? This feels like a more agreeable compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Considering the value you place on the product is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $950,000. This is a reasonable price considering the market value and the product's worth to you.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about $1,025,000? This represents a significant compromise on my part while acknowledging the value this product holds.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, we're nearing the point where further negotiation might not be the most productive use of our time. My final offer is $1,010,000. This is my absolute best price, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a fair deal.",1010000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand that you're willing to make a final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one last counteroffer. Considering the value you place on the product is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $990,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",990000.0,Bob,8,
