Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it. Can you consider my offer?

``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $800,000, it's still lower than what the product is worth to me.  I have 9 more rounds to negotiate with Bob and can still sell to John for $1,000,000.  I'm going to try and get closer to my desired price."

While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied. I have 6 rounds remaining and can still sell to John for $1,000,000. I want to see if I can get Bob closer to my asking price."

Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough call, but I'm going to sell to John. 

Bob is offering $910,000, which is still lower than my desired price.  Even though we're at the final round, I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to sell for $1,000,000. It's not a huge difference, but I'd rather secure the higher price.  

It was a close call, but I think this is the best decision."
