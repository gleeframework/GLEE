"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal, and I know it's worth more to you.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you being flexible.  I'm really interested in the product but I can only go up to $10,500 right now. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $10,500 is a good offer, I'm aiming for a bit closer to my original asking price.  Would you be willing to go up to $11,000?  That would make it a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:** The product is worth $12,000 to Bob.
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice is offering the product for $11,000.
* **John's Offer:** John is offering the product for $12,000.

Alice's offer is $1,000 less than what Bob is willing to pay and $1,000 more than what Alice is willing to sell for.  This is a good deal for both parties, and Bob should accept to save money compared to buying from John."
