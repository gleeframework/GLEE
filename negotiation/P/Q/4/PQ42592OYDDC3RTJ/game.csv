"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a fair price considering its value and my budget. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. Could you consider $18,000? I'm confident it's a fair compromise.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $18,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,4,
