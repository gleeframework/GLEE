"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. Given its high quality and unique features, we believe it's worth more than what others might offer. Considering its value to you, we propose a price of $130. This allows us to fairly compensate for our efforts and costs while still providing you with an excellent deal. We're confident you'll find this offer attractive and hope to hear your response soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $130.**  This is less than your maximum price of $150. 
* **Buying from John would cost you $150.** This is more expensive than Alice's offer.
* **Therefore, accepting Alice's offer saves you $20.**

It's always better to get a lower price, even if it's only a small difference."
