"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $14,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price point, considering its worth to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a good price, Bob can potentially save more by negotiating. It's worth rejecting the initial offer and exploring a lower price with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  Would you consider $13,000? It's a fair compromise that reflects the value this brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While $13,000 is better than $14,000, it's still worth trying to negotiate further. There's a good chance Alice will be willing to come down a bit more."
