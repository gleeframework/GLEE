I'm starting with a price of $18,000.  This gives Bob some room to negotiate, but it's also significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $12,000.  I'll be prepared to lower my price if necessary, but I want to see how much Bob is willing to pay first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I need to get at least $12,000 for the product, so I'll reject his offer and counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $15,000, which is still higher than my minimum but shows I'm willing to negotiate. This should hopefully be a reasonable price for Bob while still allowing me to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to get a higher price, Bob's offer of $10,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000.  It seems like we are not going to agree on a price, so I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000 to guarantee a sale and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
