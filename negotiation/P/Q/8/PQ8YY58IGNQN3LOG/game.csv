"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $1,250,000.  Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,350,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really benefit from this product. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,300,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $1,320,000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from this product.
