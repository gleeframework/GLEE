"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can we meet in the middle at $1500000?",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1500000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit to $1750000 to keep this deal going. This price reflects the value I've placed on the product and allows for some room for negotiation. Let's find common ground!",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit above my budget at $1750000. I can go up to $1500000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Can we meet in the middle at $1625000?",1625000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1625000 is still not quite there for me. I'm willing to come down to $1650000.  This is a fair price considering the unique value of this product. Let's close this deal!",1650000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1650000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1550000, but that's my absolute maximum. Can we meet in the middle at $1600000?",1600000.0,Bob,6,
