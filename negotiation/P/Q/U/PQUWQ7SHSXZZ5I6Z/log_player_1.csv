"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
At this point, it's a good idea to accept Bob's offer.  You've gotten closer to your initial goal of $15,000, and there's no guarantee you'll do better in the remaining rounds.  If you keep rejecting, you risk getting a lower offer from Bob or running out of rounds and being forced to sell to John at the minimum price."
