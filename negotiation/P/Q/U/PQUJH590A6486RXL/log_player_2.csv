# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth more to you than the $12,000 you're willing to pay.  Let me know what you think!

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,000 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for, but I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. Let's make this deal happen!
