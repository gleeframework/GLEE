Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth more to you than the $12,000 you're willing to pay.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. 
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and  positive, emphasizing the value of the product for Bob. This sets a good tone for negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming for a price as close to $15,000 as possible.
* By starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, I create room for negotiation and potentially get a better price. 
* If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counter, but I can always choose to sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable spending.  How about $13,000? I'm serious about buying your product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a higher price.  I can likely get closer to my goal by making a counteroffer and seeing if Bob is willing to budge a bit more. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will counter Bob's offer, aiming for a price between $13,000 and $14,000.  I'll likely offer $13,500 to see if I can find a middle ground. 
* If Bob rejects again, I'll need to decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,000 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for, but I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **$13,500:** This is a compromise price, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. 
* **Message:** I'm staying positive and emphasizing the fairness of the deal while acknowledging Bob's perspective.

**Strategy:**

* By offering $13,500, I'm signaling that I'm serious about reaching a deal with Bob. 
* If he rejects this offer, I'll have to carefully consider whether to continue negotiating or sell to John."
