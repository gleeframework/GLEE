"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for less from John if he needs to, and it's worth negotiating to see if he can get a better price from Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  However, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,500. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,500. I think this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  It's a good price, considering he can get it for less than what John is offering. While he could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting the offer and him having to buy from John at a higher price is too high."
