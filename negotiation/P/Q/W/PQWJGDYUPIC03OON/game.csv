"Thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I can do $125, but that's as low as I can go.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $110. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $115, and that's my final offer on this price",115.0,Alice,5,
