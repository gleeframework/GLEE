"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a unique product that has been meticulously crafted and tailored to meet your specific needs. This item holds immense value to me, but recognizing its potential worth to you, I am more than willing to consider offers. Given its significance and the benefits it could bring to you, I propose a purchase price of $800,000. This offer is designed to reflect the substantial investment required to create such a product while also acknowledging its value to you. I believe this price strikes a fair balance between our interests. Should you find this proposal acceptable, I look forward to discussing the details further. If not, I have another interested party, John, who is willing to purchase the product for its full value of $1,500,000. Thank you for considering this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob:**  Alice is offering the product for $800,000, which is significantly less than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. 
* **John's offer is not necessary:**  While John is willing to sell for $1,000,000, there's no reason for Bob to pay that much when Alice is offering a lower price.

By accepting Alice's offer, Bob saves $200,000 and still gets the product he wants."
