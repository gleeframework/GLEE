I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think your initial price is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Bob is unlikely to move much higher than his $1,450,000 offer.  While continuing negotiations is possible, it introduces risk. John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000. Taking the guaranteed higher offer makes the most financial sense in this scenario."
