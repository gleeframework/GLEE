Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This represents a significant opportunity for you to acquire it at a price below its true worth."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room to potentially secure a higher profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $1,150,000 is:
    * Attractive to Bob as it's less than his perceived value ($1,000,000).
    * Advantageous to me as it's still a substantial profit above my minimum.
* **Confident Tone:** The message highlights the product's value and positions the price as a special opportunity, increasing the chance of Bob accepting."
