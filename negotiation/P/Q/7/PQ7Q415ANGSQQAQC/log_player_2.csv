"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. Is this a price you're comfortable with? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice first. $100 is too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

We're starting with a significantly lower offer to see how much Alice is willing to budge.  This leaves us room to negotiate upwards while still staying well below our $80 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about $85? It's a fair price that I think we can both agree on. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but we're still not at a price I'm willing to pay. Let's see if we can nudge her a little closer to $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $75? That's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

We're moving closer to a potential agreement. Offering $75 keeps us below our $80 limit but shows Alice we are willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $82? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $82. While we could try to negotiate further, it's not worth the risk of her increasing the price again. John offers a guaranteed price of $80, which is a better deal at this point."
