"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to acquire the product for a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.  This price reflects the value I see in the product, while still offering you a good return on your investment.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,125,000. This would be a fair compromise that allows both of us to make a reasonable deal.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,180,000. I believe this price is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value and the negotiations so far.",1180000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm willing to go up a bit to $1,140,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away with a good deal.  Let's try to close this gap and reach an agreement.",1140000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,160,000, but I'm not going to go any higher than that. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",1160000.0,Alice,7,
