"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it would be a significant asset to you. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Here's how to decide:

* **Alice's Offer:** $1,150,000
* **Your Maximum:** $1,200,000
* **John's Offer:** $1,200,000

Since Alice's offer is less than both your maximum and John's offer, it makes the most sense to accept.
