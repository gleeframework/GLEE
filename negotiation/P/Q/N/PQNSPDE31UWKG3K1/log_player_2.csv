"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something worth a significant amount to your business.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  As Bob, the goal is to save money.  Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation and a potential better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000,  considering the value this product brings. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if Alice is willing to drop the price further.  There's still potential to get a better deal."
