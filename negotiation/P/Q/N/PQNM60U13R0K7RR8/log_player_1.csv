"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  Since I don't know Bob's value, I'm taking a chance he might be willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, we'll see what his counteroffer is and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get a bit more.  I'll counteroffer in the next round and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm going to counter with $15,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer but still allows for a good profit. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a more reasonable price and accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $13,000. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a decent profit and avoids the risk of further negotiations.  There's always a chance that I could get a better offer later, but it's getting close to the end of our negotiation rounds, and I don't want to risk losing out completely."
