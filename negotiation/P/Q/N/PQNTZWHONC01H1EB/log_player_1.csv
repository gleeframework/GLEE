"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is a bit too high for me.  Given my research on the market value of similar products, I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. This seems fair to both of us, and I'm hopeful we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,300,000 is a respectable offer, I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,650,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth."", 
""product_price"": 1650000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,650,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,450,000. This is a significant step closer to your position, and I'm hopeful we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly interested and is moving closer to my desired price range. I'm not in a rush and still have negotiating room before approaching John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To show I'm serious about closing a deal, I'm willing to accept $1,550,000. This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber."",
""product_price"": 1550000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,550,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is now offering a price significantly higher than John's offer and is clearly motivated to buy. While I might be able to push for a slightly higher amount, the risk of losing the deal outweighs the potential reward at this point. Accepting $1,500,000 ensures a substantial profit."
