"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750000 is significantly below what I consider a fair price. I'm willing to come down to $825000, but this is my final offer. If you're not comfortable with this, I'll need to explore other options.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $825000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775000. I'm confident that we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $775000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $800000, which is the absolute minimum I can accept. This price reflects the true value of the product, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us. If you're not willing to go that high, I'll have to move on to other options.",800000.0,Alice,5,
