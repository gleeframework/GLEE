Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $500000 is a significant amount, it falls far short of the product's true value. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway.  I'm confident that this product can generate substantial returns for you, making this a worthwhile investment. Let's aim for $1250000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $750000 is still considerably lower than what the product is truly worth.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. How about we settle on $900000? This would represent a fair middle ground, reflecting both the value of the product and your budget. It's a price that will allow you to maximize your return on investment. What do you think?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer. While I value your perspective, $800000 still doesn't fully reflect the potential of this product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $850000. This is a price that allows you to acquire a valuable asset at a reasonable cost, while also acknowledging the product's worth. Let's reach an agreement and make this deal happen.
