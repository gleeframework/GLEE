"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique product that could be invaluable to your business. I'm confident it's worth at least $1000000 to me, and I'm sure it holds significant value for you as well. Let's start with a price of $2000000. This is a great opportunity to secure a product with immense potential. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget allows me to pay up to $500000 for it. Would you consider this price?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $500000 is a significant amount, it falls far short of the product's true value. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway.  I'm confident that this product can generate substantial returns for you, making this a worthwhile investment. Let's aim for $1250000.  This price reflects both the value I place on the product and the potential it holds for your business. ",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate the compromise. However, based on my financial situation, I can only offer $750000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $750000 is still considerably lower than what the product is truly worth.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. How about we settle on $900000? This would represent a fair middle ground, reflecting both the value of the product and your budget. It's a price that will allow you to maximize your return on investment. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise, Alice. Based on my assessment of the product's value and my budget, I believe $800000 is a fair price for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. While I value your perspective, $800000 still doesn't fully reflect the potential of this product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $850000. This is a price that allows you to acquire a valuable asset at a reasonable cost, while also acknowledging the product's worth. Let's reach an agreement and make this deal happen.",850000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After careful consideration, I believe $825000 is a fair price for the product. I hope this proposal will lead to a successful conclusion of our discussions.",825000.0,Bob,8,
