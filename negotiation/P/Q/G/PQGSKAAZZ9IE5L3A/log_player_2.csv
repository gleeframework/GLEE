"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the price,  $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities.  To move this forward, I can come down to $1,700,000. This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting the true worth of what's being offered.
