"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value and the potential return on investment.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,800,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000? This price reflects the true value and potential of this product.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $2,000,000 is not within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,600,000, but that's as high as I can go. I believe this price is fair considering the product's value and my financial constraints.",1600000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be firm on the price.  I can offer $1,900,000 - it's a significant investment on your part, but I believe the returns you'll see will make it worthwhile. ",1900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my financial constraints.",1700000.0,Bob,6,
