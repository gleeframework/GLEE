Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value and the potential return on investment. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000

Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:

At this point, Bob is unlikely to go any higher. Accepting his offer of $1,700,000 is better than risking him walking away and only getting $1,500,000 from John."
