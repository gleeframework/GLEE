"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. It's a fair price, and it allows us both to get a good deal. Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a great price for you considering the value of the product. Let's find a middle ground and make this deal work!",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $8,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,200, which is a good compromise.  I'm sure you'll agree that this is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal!",8200.0,Bob,4,
