"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can come to a better agreement. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $1150000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,150,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm going to try and negotiate a better price with Bob.  I have 8 more rounds, so I can afford to be a bit more patient."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $1,250,000? This gives you a good deal and still allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I am willing to increase my offer to $1225000. This brings us closer to your original asking price while still keeping the transaction beneficial for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,225,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While I would have liked to get closer to my initial asking price, it's a good deal and I don't want to risk losing the sale to another buyer or having to go through more rounds of negotiation."
