"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try to negotiate with Alice first.  $95 is still too high, and there are rounds left to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
``` 

I'm offering $85. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, as it's closer to Alice's value of $80 but still leaves room for her to make a profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$90 is still too high. I'll try to negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 87}
``` 

I'm increasing my offer to $87. This is a good compromise that's closer to Alice's preferred price and shows I'm serious about getting a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice seems unwilling to budge further.  Since I'm running out of rounds and John's price is $100, accepting $90 is the best option at this point."
