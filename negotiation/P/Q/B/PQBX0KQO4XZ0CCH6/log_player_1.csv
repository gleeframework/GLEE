"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $95. This is a good starting point as it's a fair price for both of us - it's above my minimum and below Bob's maximum value. This should encourage Bob to accept the offer, but it also leaves room for negotiation if he decides to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $85 is above my minimum of $80, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $95. I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm countering with $90. This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but still within my acceptable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer.  While $87 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm hoping to get a bit more. I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90} 
```

I'm sticking with $90. I believe this is a fair price, and with only 5 rounds left, I don't want to risk going too low and getting stuck with a price I'm not happy with."
