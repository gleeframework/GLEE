Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, but it gives me room to negotiate and potentially earn more. It also signals that I believe the product is valuable and I'm not desperate to sell it.  I'll be watching closely to see Bob's reaction and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm not ready to settle just yet. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18500}
```

I'm counter-offering with $18,500. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaving some room for further bargaining. Hopefully, this will encourage Bob to move closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum. While I'd prefer a bit more, it's getting too risky to continue negotiating. If I reject this offer, Bob might walk away, and selling to John would leave me with a much lower profit. Accepting this offer ensures a decent sale and avoids any potential losses."
