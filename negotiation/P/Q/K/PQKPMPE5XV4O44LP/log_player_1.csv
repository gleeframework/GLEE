"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential ROI for you."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price, leaving room for concessions. This also helps you gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Anchoring:**  By opening with $2,250,000, we establish a high anchor point in Bob's mind. Even though it's significantly higher than his perceived value, it sets the stage for subsequent offers to seem more reasonable in comparison. 
* **Justification:**  Mentioning the ""unique value proposition"" and ""potential ROI"" aims to frame the price within a context of value, not just a number.

This strategy allows us to gather information about Bob's willingness to pay while leaving ample room to negotiate down towards a mutually beneficial agreement over the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While we could try to negotiate for a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,500,000 matches the price John is willing to pay. Accepting now guarantees us our minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of the negotiation failing."
