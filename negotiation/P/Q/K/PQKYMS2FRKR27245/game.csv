,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $70 is a bit too steep for me at this moment. I'm willing to pay $65 for the product. Let me know what you think.",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $72. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",72.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $72 is still a little high for me. I'm happy to meet in the middle at $68. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be worth it. What do you say?",68.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I think $70 is a more reasonable price considering the product's value. It's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a fair price. What do you think?",70.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $70 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm confident we can find a compromise that works for both of us. How about $69? This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm really excited to get this product.  Let me know your thoughts.",69.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob! However, I still need to make a bit more profit. How about we meet at $71? It's a slight increase from your last offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",71.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. However, $71 is still a little more than I'm willing to pay right now. Let's split the difference and go with $70. This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm eager to finalize this purchase. What do you say?",70.0,Bob,8,
