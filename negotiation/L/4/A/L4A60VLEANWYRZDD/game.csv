"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this fantastic item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $9,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value to you is $12,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,500. This is a fair price that still gives me a good profit. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,500 is still a bit outside my budget.  How about we meet somewhere in the middle, say around $11,000? I think that's a fair deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value to you is $12,000, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,200. This is my final offer, as I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",13200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down further. I'm trying to make this work, but $13,200 is still a bit of a stretch.  Would you consider $11,800? That's a pretty significant move on my end.",11800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,800. Considering the product's value to you is $12,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,800. This is my final offer, as I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",12800.0,Alice,7,
