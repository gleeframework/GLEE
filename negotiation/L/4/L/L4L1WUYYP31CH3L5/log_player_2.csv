"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $11,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm close to accepting your offer, but I still need to make a bit more profit. I'll meet you at $10,500. It's a small increase, but it's worth it for the value this product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

Round 6

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your frustration, and I appreciate your willingness to make a final offer. However, I'm still not comfortable with $10,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,500 and $10,250. I'll sell the product to you for $10,375. It's a compromise, but I think it's fair for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,375
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

At this point, Alice is very slowly approaching my price range.  It's unlikely further haggling will yield much more savings, and I risk her countering above my limit or stalling until I have to buy from John at full price."
