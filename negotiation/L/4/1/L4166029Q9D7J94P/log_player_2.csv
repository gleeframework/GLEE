"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a very attractive price of $1100000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a price significantly below its true worth. I understand you may have other options, but I believe this is a deal that's mutually beneficial. Please let me know if you're interested.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than the product's true worth, it's still higher than what Bob can get from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can buy the product from John for $1,000,000, saving him $100,000."
