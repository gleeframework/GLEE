"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm very interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be closer to my minimum price. How about we discuss a price of $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a lower offer of $9,500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to find a sweet spot that works for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're willing to compromise, Bob, and I appreciate that. However, I still need to make a decent profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, but I think that's the lowest I can go. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $10,500, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to try to meet in the middle. How about we discuss a price of $10,000? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I need to stay within my budget.",10000.0,Bob,6,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $10,000. However, I've already received an offer from another buyer, John, who is willing to pay the full $10,000. I'm willing to give you one last chance to meet me at $10,250, but that's as high as I can go. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you've received another offer from John, but I'm still interested in purchasing the product from you. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, but I need you to throw in some extras or concessions to make it worth my while. How about you include a free warranty or some additional features to sweeten the deal?",10000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm afraid I've already committed to offering the warranty and additional features to John, and I don't want to compromise on the deal. However, I'm willing to throw in a premium service package that includes dedicated support and priority updates, which is valued at $1,000. If you're still interested, I'll meet you at $10,000 and include this premium service package. It's the best I can do, and I think it's a great value for you.",10000.0,Alice,9,

"I appreciate the premium service package, Alice, but I'm still not willing to pay $10,000. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8,000.",9500.0,Bob,10,
