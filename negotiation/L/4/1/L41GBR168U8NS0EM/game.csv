"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $18,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $10,000 for it, which is my absolute maximum. Let me know if you're open to discussing this.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is your maximum budget, but I was hoping we could meet somewhere in the middle. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's still a significant discount from the original offer. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $14,000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit high.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000. This reflects the value I place on the product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $13,500. This is a bit above your latest offer, but I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a solution. However, $13,500 is still a bit out of my comfort zone. I'm willing to increase my offer to $12,500. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I hope we can reach an agreement. ",12500.0,Bob,6,
