I'm starting with a high offer of $1,800,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if necessary, while also aiming for a profit above my minimum value.  Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer to determine my next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but I'm not ready to settle just yet. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price to $1,600,000.  This is still above Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to compromise.  I'm hoping this will lead to a quicker agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hesitant to accept.  I'll make one more counteroffer to see if we can close the gap.  If he rejects, I'll go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000. This is a significant decrease from my previous offer, and it's only $50,000 above Bob's last offer. I'm hoping this shows I'm serious about making a deal, but if Bob still rejects, I'll take the $1,200,000 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum, but I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation.  At this point, it's not worth risking further rounds for a potential, very small increase in price.  It's time to secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
