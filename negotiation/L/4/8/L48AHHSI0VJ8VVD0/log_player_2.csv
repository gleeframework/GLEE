Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm surprised you're willing to meet me at $1,000,000, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell at that price. I'm going to take a risk and try to get a better deal. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you don't accept it.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a tough one, but here's why I'd accept:

* **Alice is signaling a hard limit:** Her language (""final offer,"" ""walk away"") suggests she won't go lower. 
* **The price difference is getting smaller:**  While $1,050,000 isn't ideal, it's a better deal than John's $1,500,000. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If you push further and Alice walks, you're stuck with John's much higher price. 

Sometimes in negotiation, a good deal is about minimizing losses rather than getting your absolute ideal price."
