Round 4
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly interested and getting closer to my acceptable range. I'll hold firm for now and see if I can push him a bit higher in the next round."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not ready to meet at $1,300,000. I'm willing to pay $1,225,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, but it's still too slow.  It's time to raise the stakes a bit and see if he's willing to come closer to my desired price. I'll make another counter offer, but I'm also getting closer to accepting John's offer if the negotiation stalls."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation on your end. I'm willing to make this very attractive for you: $1,275,000, but this is my final offer.  I have another interested buyer, and I need to make a decision soon."",

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the urgency, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,225,000 for the product, and that's my final offer. I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has now issued a final offer and seems firm on his price. While it's slightly less than I hoped for, it's still a significant profit above my minimum.  Continuing the negotiation carries the risk of losing both offers. It's time to close the deal with Bob."
