"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for the product.  This is the maximum I can afford, considering I have other options available.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1500000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell for. If you're still interested, please let me know.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1500000 is closer to my budget, I'm still only able to offer $1200000. If you're open to this price, we can finalize the deal. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm counteroffering at $1350000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. If you're still interested, please let me know.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
