Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value but still below my minimum. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This leaves room for Bob to counteroffer without me feeling pressured to sell for less than I want. 
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a friendly and optimistic tone encourages Bob to continue the negotiation. 
* **Prepared for John:** I'm ready to switch to John if the negotiation with Bob stalls or becomes unproductive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! That product looks great, but $135 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Opportunity to counter:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer, potentially securing a higher price.
* **John's offer is a backup:**  I'm confident I can get a better price than $100 from Bob, but John's offer provides a safety net if the negotiation falls through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $120? That would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This counteroffer splits the difference between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting value:** Emphasizing the ""great deal"" for Bob reinforces his interest in the product.
* **Fair profit:**  This price allows me to make a profit while still being competitive.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  There is still room for Bob to counter, but I'm closer to my minimum acceptable price."
