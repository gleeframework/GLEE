Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire an asset that could significantly benefit you."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($800,000). 
* **Strong Opening:** Starting with a strong offer ($1,300,000) leaves room for potential negotiation while aiming for a significant profit.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $800,000 to John gives you leverage. You don't have to settle for less than $1,300,000 unless Bob negotiates strategically. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or financial limitations.
* It's a single offer, and depending on the situation, a more flexible approach involving counter-offers might be necessary."
