"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her perceived value of the product, it's still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but it's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm proposing a new price of $1,100,000 for the product. This is a compromise between our initial offers and still reflects the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer, but it's still higher than my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While I could continue negotiating, it's getting closer to my limit. It's better to secure the product from John at a guaranteed price of $1,000,000 than risk further negotiation with Alice."
