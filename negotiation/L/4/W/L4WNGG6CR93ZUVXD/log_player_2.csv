"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I would like to reject Alice's offer. The product is too expensive for me at $12,000, and I can get it from John for $8,000, which is a much better deal.
