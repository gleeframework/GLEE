"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay closer to my initial price. How about $825,000?  I believe this is still a fair price considering the value of the product.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $825,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $775,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to meet you at $800,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to get a good return and you to acquire a valuable product.  Let's close this deal.",800000.0,Alice,5,
