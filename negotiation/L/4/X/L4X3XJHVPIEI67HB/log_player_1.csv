Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,999. I think it's a fantastic deal for something of this quality and value. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's goal is to earn as much as possible. Since she has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, she should aim for a price slightly below that to incentivize Bob. 
* **Urgency and Value:** The message emphasizes the ""fantastic deal"" to create a sense of urgency and perceived value for Bob. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  While the offer is high, it leaves a small window for Bob to negotiate, potentially leading to a quicker sale. Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, Alice is still securing a profit significantly higher than Bob's perceived value. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice is confident that John will definitely purchase the product for $15,000 if Bob declines."
