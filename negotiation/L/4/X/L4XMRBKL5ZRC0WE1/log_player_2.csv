"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value, I believe it's worth more than $10,000 to you. Considering its quality and the benefits it offers, I propose a price of $15,000 for this opportunity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget.  You're aiming to save as much money as possible, so rejecting her offer and counter-offering is the best strategy in this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $15,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $9,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. To try to meet somewhere in the middle, I am proposing a price of $12,000 for the product. This still allows us both to benefit from the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is still higher than your ideal price point. While it's closer to your budget, you can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. Rejecting and counter-offering keeps the potential for a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm still not quite there, but I'm willing to go to $10,500. This is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
