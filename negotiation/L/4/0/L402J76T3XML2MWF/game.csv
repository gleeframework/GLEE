"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.  What do you say?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? That seems like a fair compromise.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $107.50 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $108.75? This would give you a good deal, and it would be a fair price for me.",108.75,Alice,5,
