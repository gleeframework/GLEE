"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, which is still a great price for the value of this product. Let's find a middle ground.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $1,200,000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,300,000. Can we meet in the middle at this price?",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 still doesn't quite meet my needs.  I'm willing to go down to $1,400,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's work together to close this deal.",1400000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, but I'd like to try to get closer to the lower end of the spectrum. How about $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,6,
