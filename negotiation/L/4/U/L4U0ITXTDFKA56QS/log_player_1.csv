I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,500. This is a fair price that's above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to counter. I believe this is a good starting point to maximize my profit while also leaving some room for a potential deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $11,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves me a good profit. I'm hoping Bob sees this as a fair price and is willing to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I would prefer a higher price, $10,800 is a good deal considering the risk of further negotiation. It's significantly more than selling to John and  I'm confident I can't get a much better price from Bob."
