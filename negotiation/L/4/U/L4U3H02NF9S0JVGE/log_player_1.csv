Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}

This offer is a starting point that's closer to my minimum value of $15,000 but leaves some room for negotiation.  I believe Bob might be willing to pay a little more than $12,000, and I want to see if I can find a price we're both happy with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, but I still believe I can get closer to $14,000.  I'll make a counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

I'm willing to meet Bob halfway. $13,500 is a fair compromise that allows both of us to gain something from the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

```

Bob's offer is too low for me. I'm willing to accept a smaller profit to ensure a sale, but $12,800 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  John's offer of $15,000 is much more appealing and aligns with my goals."
