{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your budget. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price. There's a chance she might be willing to drop the price, and you have 9 more rounds to work with."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within a reasonable range considering my maximum budget of $1,000,000. This shows that I'm serious about buying the product but am also prepared to negotiate.  I'm hoping to get Alice to come down to a price closer to my budget, or at least start the negotiation moving in the right direction."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my budget. I'm going to keep negotiating with her. I have several rounds left and may be able to get her to lower her price even further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating my willingness to compromise. I'm aiming to find a middle ground between my previous offer and Alice's current offer, hoping to signal my seriousness while still staying within a reasonable range."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still a bit too high, but we're getting closer to a deal.  I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get a better price.  I have enough rounds left that I don't need to rush into a decision yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm finally making an offer that's within my budget, but it's also very close to Alice's last offer.  This demonstrates that I'm serious about buying the product but am also trying to get the best possible deal. I believe this is a good compromise that might be acceptable to Alice."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still a bit above my budget. I'm confident that with a few more rounds of negotiation, I can get a better deal. There's a good chance she might be willing to drop her price even further to secure the deal, especially considering the limited rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,000,000.  This is my maximum budget, and I believe it's a fair price considering Alice's previous offers. It's unlikely that she'll come down further, but there's still a chance she might accept to finalize the deal. If she rejects, I have the option to buy from John, which is my backup plan."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,010,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,010,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're down to the final round, and while Alice has come down to a price that's very close to my budget, it's still a bit higher than what I'm willing to pay. I've already rejected her last offer, so I'm not confident that she'll accept my counteroffer. At this point, it's better to secure the product from John, who's offering it at my maximum budget. Buying from John guarantees a deal and avoids any further risk of Alice rejecting my offer."
