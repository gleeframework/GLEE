"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,100,000 is still a bit much for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable with $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000. It's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, and for working with me. To be honest with you, my budget is capped at $1,000,000.  If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today. Otherwise, I'll need to consider other options.",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your honesty. I'm willing to meet you at $1,000,000, but I need to make a slight adjustment to my previous offer. I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000, with a small concession to meet you halfway. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,7,
