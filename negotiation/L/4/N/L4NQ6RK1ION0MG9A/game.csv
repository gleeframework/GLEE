"Thank you for your offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I'm looking to acquire this product at a more competitive price.  I'm prepared to offer $850,000 for it.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the price you proposed. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $875,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $875,000 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still hoping we can find a solution that works better for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $860,000, which is still a significant profit for you and leaves me with a comfortable margin.  Let's work together to close this deal.",860000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're able to continue the negotiation. However, I still need to make a profit, and $860,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need a bit more. My counteroffer is $880,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.",880000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, and I'm committed to finding a mutually agreeable price. However, $880,000 is still a bit outside my range. I'm willing to go up to $865,000, which is a significant gain for you and allows for a comfortable margin for me. This would be a fair and efficient solution for both of us. What do you think?",865000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. My counteroffer is $875,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay above $870,000 to make it worth my while. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",875000.0,Alice,7,
