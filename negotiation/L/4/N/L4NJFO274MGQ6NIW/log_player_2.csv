# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate from here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway.
