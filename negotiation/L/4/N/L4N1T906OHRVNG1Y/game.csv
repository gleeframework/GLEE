"Hi Bob, I'm interested in selling you this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it beneficial. I'm initially offering it at $1,150,000.  What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering your value for the product and my own budget.  Let's see if we can work something out.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is already a compromise on my end.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? It's a win-win for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise, and it's closer to my budget.  Let's finalize the deal.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
