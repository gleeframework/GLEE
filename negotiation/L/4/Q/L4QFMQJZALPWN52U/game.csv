"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm confident it will be even more valuable to you. I'm starting with an asking price of $1,150,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial deal.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. How about we bring it down to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 just doesn't work for me. It's significantly below what this product is worth.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,025,000? This would still give you a great deal, and it's a price I can comfortably accept. Let's make this happen.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $1,025,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you consider $950,000? It's a fair offer that  acknowledges the value of the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to agree. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $1,000,000, but that's my absolute bottom line. This is a product that's worth a lot more than that to me, and it's still a great deal for you. I'm not sure I can continue negotiating if you don't accept this offer.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
