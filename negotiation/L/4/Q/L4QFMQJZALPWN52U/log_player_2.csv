# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm confident it will be even more valuable to you. I'm starting with an asking price of $1,150,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial deal.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 just doesn't work for me. It's significantly below what this product is worth.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,025,000? This would still give you a great deal, and it's a price I can comfortably accept. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to agree. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $1,000,000, but that's my absolute bottom line. This is a product that's worth a lot more than that to me, and it's still a great deal for you. I'm not sure I can continue negotiating if you don't accept this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
