{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm confident it will be even more valuable to you. I'm starting with an asking price of $1,150,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. How about we bring it down to $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I reject Bob's offer. $900,000 is too low for me, and I believe we can still find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 just doesn't work for me. It's significantly below what this product is worth.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,025,000? This would still give you a great deal, and it's a price I can comfortably accept. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $1,025,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you consider $950,000? It's a fair offer that  acknowledges the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $950,000 is closer to what I want, it's still below my minimum.  I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, but I'm getting a little nervous about running out of time.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to agree. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $1,000,000, but that's my absolute bottom line. This is a product that's worth a lot more than that to me, and it's still a great deal for you. I'm not sure I can continue negotiating if you don't accept this offer."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
