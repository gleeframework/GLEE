"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $70 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $82?",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $80. Can you consider a counteroffer of $78? I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to stay within my budget.",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go below $85. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we try $83?",83.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to give me a discount, Alice. However, $83 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $78 and $83, which would be $80.50. Can you consider that?",80.5,Bob,6,
