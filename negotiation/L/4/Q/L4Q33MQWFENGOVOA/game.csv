"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $800,000. Would you consider lowering your price?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However,  $800,000 is significantly lower than my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000 to meet you halfway. This price still allows me to get a decent return on my investment. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the effort. However, I am still looking to stay within my budget of $800,000. Would you consider meeting me at this price point?",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. However, I still need a price that reflects the value of my product.  How about $900,000? It's a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I am still looking to stay within $800,000. I would like to propose $850,000 as a compromise. This would allow us to come closer to each other while still respecting my budget constraints.",850000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $850,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not able to go that low.  How about $900,000? This feels like a fair price that respects both our needs. Let's close the deal at this point.",900000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, I am still unable to reach $900,000. I would like to propose $875,000 as a compromise. This would bring us closer to my budget while still allowing for a fair transaction.",875000.0,Bob,8,
