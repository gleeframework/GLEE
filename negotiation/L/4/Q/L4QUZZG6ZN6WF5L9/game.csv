"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I'm excited to start our negotiation. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $800,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $750,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $750,000 is a step in the right direction,  I'm still aiming for a price closer to $650,000. This would be a fair compromise, giving us both a good deal. What do you think?",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'll sell the product to you for $700,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise.",700000.0,Alice,5,
