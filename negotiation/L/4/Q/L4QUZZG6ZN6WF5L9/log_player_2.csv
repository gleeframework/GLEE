Alice is now willing to sell for $750,000, which is a significant drop from her initial offer. However, I still believe there's room for a lower price. By rejecting the offer, I can continue the negotiation and try to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $750,000 is a step in the right direction,  I'm still aiming for a price closer to $650,000. This would be a fair compromise, giving us both a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 650000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'll sell the product to you for $700,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer of $800,000 to $700,000. While I would prefer a lower price, this is a good deal considering I can buy the same product from John for $1,000,000.  I'm willing to accept Alice's offer and secure the product for $700,000."
