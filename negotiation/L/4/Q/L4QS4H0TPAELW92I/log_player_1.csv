Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have another interested buyer."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Knowing Bob values the product at $800,000 and you have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, starting high maximizes potential profit.
* **Slight room for negotiation:** A price of $950,000 leaves some space for Bob to negotiate, making him feel like he might get a ""deal.""
* **Creating urgency:** Mentioning another buyer introduces a fear of missing out, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough for him to accept."
