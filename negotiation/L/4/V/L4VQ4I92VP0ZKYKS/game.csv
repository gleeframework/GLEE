"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $12000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $17000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and your initial offer. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $17000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $14000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your latest offer. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll offer you the product for $16000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,
