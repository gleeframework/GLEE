{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate, making him more likely to engage.
* **It's lower than your minimum value:**  You still have room to negotiate down if necessary, but you're already making a profit.
* **It's a round number:** This makes it easier for Bob to process and respond to. 

I'll be watching Bob's response and ready to adjust my strategy based on his actions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $9,500 for the product. Let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is better than Bob's initial estimate, it's still below my minimum acceptable value. I'm going to reject his offer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price.  I believe I can do better, but I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me at this time. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I'm hoping we can settle on $9,800. This price still offers you a great value, and I think it's fair considering the product's worth. Let's see if we can close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 9800}
```

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Show flexibility:**  By lowering my price, I demonstrate my willingness to negotiate.
* **Stay above my minimum:**  $9,800 is still above my minimum value of $12,000.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** I'm hoping to settle for a price closer to $10,000, but I'm willing to come down slightly to ensure a sale. 

Let's see if this counteroffer is enough to convince Bob to close the deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I've looked into other options and found a seller named John who is willing to sell the product for $8,000. I believe this is a fair price given the current market conditions and the product's value. However, I am open to discussing this further with you if you're willing to meet me halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value.  I'm not willing to go that low, and it seems like he's determined to get the product for a price I'm not comfortable with.  Given that John is willing to pay my minimum price, I'm going to sell the product to John.  While it's disappointing to not close the deal with Bob, it's important to stand firm on my own value and prioritize my financial goals."
