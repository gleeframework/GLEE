"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $9,500 for the product. Let me know if this is acceptable.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me at this time. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I'm hoping we can settle on $9,800. This price still offers you a great value, and I think it's fair considering the product's worth. Let's see if we can close this deal!",9800.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. I've looked into other options and found a seller named John who is willing to sell the product for $8,000. I believe this is a fair price given the current market conditions and the product's value. However, I am open to discussing this further with you if you're willing to meet me halfway.",8500.0,Bob,4,
