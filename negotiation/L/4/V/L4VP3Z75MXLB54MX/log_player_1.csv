Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $11,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I can likely get a better deal.  I'll see if I can get closer to my target price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $11,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if you're still interested at this price."", ""product_price"": 15000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, $15,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $13,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $14,000, but that's my final offer.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, this product seems really valuable, and I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle at $13,500? I think that's a fair compromise.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000.  While I could keep negotiating with Bob, the price is not getting me closer to my desired profit.  John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, so it's the safer option."
