"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $11,000. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $11,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if you're still interested at this price.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, $15,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $13,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $14,000, but that's my final offer.  This product is truly valuable, and I'm confident it will bring you a great return on investment.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, this product seems really valuable, and I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle at $13,500? I think that's a fair compromise.",13500.0,Bob,6,
