"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  I think it would be a valuable asset for you. I'm asking for $22,000 to start negotiations.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $22,000 is quite a bit higher than my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $10,000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However, $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  Could you meet me halfway at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $16,000 is still too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000. It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we split the difference between our last offers and settle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $14,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000, but I can't go any higher.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",13000.0,Bob,6,
