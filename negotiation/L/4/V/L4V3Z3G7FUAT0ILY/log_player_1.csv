Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $22,000 is quite a bit higher than my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $10,000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However, $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  Could you meet me halfway at $16,000?"", ""product_price"": 16000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $16,000 is still too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000. It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $14,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000, but I can't go any higher.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is unlikely to move much higher than $13,000. While we could try to negotiate him up slightly, it's not worth the risk of him walking away entirely. John offers a guaranteed $15,000, which is a solid profit and avoids further negotiation."
