Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,150,000."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price slightly higher than you hope to get. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Targeting Bob's Valuation:** I know Bob values the product at $1,200,000. Offering it at $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation but still ensures a significant profit for me while leaving Bob with a potential gain.
* **Alternative Option:** Having John as a backup buyer at $1,000,000 provides a safety net. I'm not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000). I still have room to negotiate and try to reach a price closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to risk John's offer to potentially gain an additional $50,000 or more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm motivated to sell,  $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  By suggesting a price of $1,100,000, I'm demonstrating willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a strong profit. 
* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer splits the difference between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, which is often perceived as fair in negotiations. 
* **Maintain Walk-Away Option:** I'm still above my ""walk-away"" price of $1,000,000 (from John), giving me leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit too high. How about we meet at $1,075,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Acceptable Profit:** Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is only $25,000 less than my previous counter-offer and represents a substantial profit over my minimum ($1,000,000). 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate has diminishing returns. Bob is unlikely to agree to a price much higher than this. Accepting now guarantees a good profit. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now avoids potential delays and allows me to use the funds sooner."
