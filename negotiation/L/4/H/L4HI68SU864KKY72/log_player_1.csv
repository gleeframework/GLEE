"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully maximizes my profit. However, it's important to remember that I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 at any time, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob doesn't come close to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still lower than my initial asking price and I'm not desperate. I want to see if I can push for a higher price, especially since I have the fallback option of selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,400,000, showing a willingness to compromise. This should make Bob feel like we're moving towards a deal while still leaving me some room to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob hasn't budged on his offer, so I'm going to reject it again. I'm still hoping for a better price, and I'm not yet willing to settle for $1,200,000.  We have several rounds left, and I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm making a slightly lower counteroffer of $1,350,000. I'm trying to find a price that is acceptable to Bob while still being profitable for me. I'm hoping this will be enough to sway Bob to finally accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is clearly trying to push for a lower price, but $1,100,000 is too low for me. I'm not desperate, and I still have several rounds left to negotiate. I'm hoping to get closer to $1,300,000, but I'm also considering the possibility of selling to John if the negotiations continue to stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer again to $1,250,000. I'm trying to meet Bob halfway while still ensuring a good profit for myself. This is a significant compromise, and I hope it will be enough to convince Bob to accept. However, if Bob continues to refuse, I may have to start seriously considering selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're down to the wire and Bob is still lowballing me. I'm not willing to drop to $1,000,000, which is only my minimum value for the product. With only two rounds left, I'm confident that John will buy the product for that price. I'm not going to risk losing out on a sale by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
