"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. Although it's tempting, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $8,500 is a good starting point, I'm hoping for something closer to my initial asking price. How about $9,500? This still leaves you a healthy profit margin."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm glad we are finding some common ground.  $9,500 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer. $9,000 is a good price, and it's better than selling to John for $8,000. I'm happy to close the deal."
