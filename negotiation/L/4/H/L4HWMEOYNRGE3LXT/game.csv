"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for a great product like this, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your budget concerns. While $12,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $14,000? It's a fair price that still allows me to get a good deal, and it's significantly closer to your offer.  Let's make this happen!",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. How about we settle on $13,750? I think this is a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can do.",13750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $13,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $14,250. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to come to an agreement. Let's close this deal!",14250.0,Alice,7,
