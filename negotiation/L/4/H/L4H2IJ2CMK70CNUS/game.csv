"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your perspective, Bob, but $1,000,000 is significantly below my bottom line.  To be fair, let's meet in the middle. How about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $900,000? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts, but we're still quite far apart.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, but that's my best offer. I need to see some movement on your end to justify going any lower.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I've been flexible, but we're running out of time. I'm willing to accept $1,100,000. However, I need to be upfront - this is my final offer. If it's not acceptable, I'll need to move on to other opportunities.",1100000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000, but that's as high as I can go. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll need to explore other options.",980000.0,Bob,8,
