"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your perspective, Bob, but $1,000,000 is significantly below my bottom line.  To be fair, let's meet in the middle. How about $1,300,000?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $900,000? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is still significantly undercutting the product's value to me. While his offer is increasing, I'm better off countering or taking John's offer if negotiations don't improve soon."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts, but we're still quite far apart.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, but that's my best offer. I need to see some movement on your end to justify going any lower."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $950,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, he's still not close enough to the product's value.  We're getting into the later rounds, and I need to signal that I'm willing to walk away from the deal if he doesn't make a significant jump."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I've been flexible, but we're running out of time. I'm willing to accept $1,100,000. However, I need to be upfront - this is my final offer. If it's not acceptable, I'll need to move on to other opportunities."",

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000, but that's as high as I can go. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly not willing to meet a price that reflects the product's value to me.  He's only incrementally increasing his offer, and I've already stated my final offer.  At this point, further negotiation is unlikely to result in a significantly better deal, and I risk losing John's guaranteed offer. It's time to move on and secure the $1,200,000 from John."
