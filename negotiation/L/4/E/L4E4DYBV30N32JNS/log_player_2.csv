"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum price of $12,000.**  You want to save as much money as possible.
* **Rejecting allows you to make a counteroffer.** You can potentially get a better price than $11,500. 
* **Buying from John is an option, but it's your last resort.** You'd prefer to negotiate with Alice if possible."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $10,500. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my minimum target. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $11,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a great deal. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your maximum price of $12,000.**  You want to save as much money as possible.
* **Rejecting allows you to make another counteroffer.**  You're getting closer to your target price, and you might be able to get Alice to lower her price even more.
* **Buying from John is still an option, but you want to see if you can get a better deal with Alice first.**"

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your maximum price of $12,000.**  You are determined to save as much money as possible. 
* **Continuing to negotiate with Alice has proven ineffective.** You've made multiple counteroffers, but she hasn't moved significantly closer to your desired price.
* **Buying from John is the best option at this point.**  Even though it's not your ideal price, it's still within your budget, and it's a quicker and more certain way to get the product you want."
