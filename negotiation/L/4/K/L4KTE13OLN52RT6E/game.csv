"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this amazing product. It's a unique and valuable item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,500,000, but I'm willing to make a concession to start the negotiation. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $1,000,000 is a tempting offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to let the product go for that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
