"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value ($150), but still within a range where Bob might be willing to negotiate. This leaves room for potential concessions in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum value ($150). I'm rejecting it and will try to counter with a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still above my minimum value. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and be willing to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value ($150).  While I'm running out of rounds, I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can reach a deal closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but still staying above my minimum value. This is my last attempt to get Bob to accept a price closer to what I want. If he rejects this, I'll sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only four rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob is too high.  Selling to John ensures I get my minimum value."
