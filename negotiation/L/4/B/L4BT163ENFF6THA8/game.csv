"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality you've described,  $500000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. Considering my budget and the value I'm looking for, I'd be willing to offer $1200000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $800000 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the value I'm placing on this product, I'm willing to offer $1000000. This would be a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
