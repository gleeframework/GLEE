"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm happy to meet you halfway, but $9,000 is still a bit lower than what I need. How about $10,500? This would still be a great deal for you, given the value of the product, and it would allow me to get a fair price. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a little hesitant about $9,750.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get closer to $10,000.  How about $10,250? It's a compromise on both our parts, and it will allow us to reach a mutually agreeable price.  What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,5,
