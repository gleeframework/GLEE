{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum price, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'll see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is more than what John is offering, it's still lower than my desired price and I believe I can get a better deal. I'll counter with a higher offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $10,000. This is a compromise that still leaves me with a decent profit while also being closer to Bob's offer.  Hopefully, this will be acceptable to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer a higher price, $9,500 is closer to my desired price and still represents a good profit. Further negotiation might lead to a better outcome, but it's also possible that I could end up with a lower price or risk losing the deal altogether. It's better to secure a good deal than to risk getting nothing at all."
