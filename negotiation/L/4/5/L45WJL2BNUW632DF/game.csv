"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a valuable piece, and I believe this price reflects its worth. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $800,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay closer to my initial price. How about $1,500,000? That's still a great deal considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but I'm on a tight budget. How about we split the difference between my last offer and your current one? I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm going to need to see a number closer to $1,300,000.  This is a significant investment for you, and it would be a valuable asset for your business.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm seeing a gap between our valuations, but I'm still very interested. To show I'm serious, I'm willing to offer $1,225,000.  This is a significant jump from my previous offer and shows how much I value this product. Let's make this work.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're stretching your budget, and I appreciate your continued interest.  $1,225,000 is a step in the right direction, but we're still a bit apart. How about we meet halfway at $1,275,000? This would give you a good deal while ensuring I get a fair price.  Let's make this happen in the next couple of rounds.",1275000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, we're getting close! I appreciate you working with me.  How about we settle this right now at $1,250,000?  It's a strong offer, and I'm eager to close this deal today.",1250000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, we're down to the wire. I'm going to need to see $1,262,500 to make this work. It's a small increase from your last offer, but it's my final offer. If you're serious about this deal, let's close it now.",1262500.0,Alice,9,
