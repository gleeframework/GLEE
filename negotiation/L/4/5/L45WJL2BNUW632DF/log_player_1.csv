Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $800,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay closer to my initial price.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but I'm on a tight budget. How about we split the difference between my last offer and your current one? I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.

While $1,150,000 is closer to what I want, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counteroffer again, but I need to be careful as I only have a few rounds left."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm going to need to see a number closer to $1,300,000.
