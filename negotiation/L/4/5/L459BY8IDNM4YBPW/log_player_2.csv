"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth $1,200,000 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's value to me, it's still a good starting point.  I want to see if I can negotiate a better price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and your desire to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $850,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and my initial offer.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to reach a compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession and offer the product for $825,000. This is still a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, and her offer of $825,000 is getting closer to my target price.  While I'd love to push for a lower price, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at $1,200,000 is too high. Accepting Alice's offer ensures I get the product at a significant discount and saves me a considerable amount of money."
