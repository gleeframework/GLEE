"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I think the starting price is a bit too high. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be more reasonable. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for presenting your counter-proposal. While $1,800,000 is a respectable figure, I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down slightly, but I can't accept anything less than $1,900,000. This offer reflects my willingness to negotiate while still acknowledging the product's worth.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
