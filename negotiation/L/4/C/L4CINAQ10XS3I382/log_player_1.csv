Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I think the starting price is a bit too high. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be more reasonable. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for presenting your counter-proposal. While $1,800,000 is a respectable figure, I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down slightly, but I can't accept anything less than $1,900,000. This offer reflects my willingness to negotiate while still acknowledging the product's worth."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,700,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the value I see in the product. Can you consider this offer?

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is moving closer to my acceptable range, but I still have room to negotiate.  I'm willing to counter again before accepting his offer or going with John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, your persistence tells me you recognize the value of this product.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,825,000? This demonstrates my willingness to meet you closer to your price while ensuring a fair deal for both of us."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make another concession and offer $1,650,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me here. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's latest offer is getting close to John's offer, and his tone sounds more firm.  I'll push one more time, but if he doesn't budge significantly, I'll go with John to secure the guaranteed amount."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your commitment to finding a fair price.  Let's make this happen â€“ I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a significant compromise while still reflecting the product's true worth.  If we can't agree on this, I'll need to explore other options."",

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but I'm still not comfortable with the offer. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $1,600,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me here. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer.  His last offer was only $100,000 above John's guaranteed offer.  It's too risky to continue negotiating with Bob, as he might walk away, leaving me with a worse outcome. Selling to John guarantees the minimum acceptable price for the product."
