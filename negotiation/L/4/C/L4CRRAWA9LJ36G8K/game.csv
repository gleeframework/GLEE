"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be a valuable asset to you.  Given its features and benefits, I'm asking for $22,000.  What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way too high for me.  This product would be useful, but I have a limit I need to stick to.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counter-offer. However, $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  To be fair to us both,  how about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that the product has value, but $18,000 is still outside my budget. I could potentially go up to $11,000.  Do you think we can make a deal work at that price?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $11,000 is too low.  Would you consider $16,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value this product brings.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference between our last offers and settle at $13,500?",13500.0,Bob,6,
