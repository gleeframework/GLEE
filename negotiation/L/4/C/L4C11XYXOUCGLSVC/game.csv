"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for starting the negotiation. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Could you consider a lower price?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $775,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair price.",775000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $775,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about we settle at $700,000? That seems like a fair compromise to me.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $725,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",725000.0,Alice,5,
