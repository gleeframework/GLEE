"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $18,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still below my minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation and increases the chance of a successful deal.  I'm also trying to establish a friendly tone to make the negotiation more agreeable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested, but I can only pay up to $12,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  $12,000 is a bit too low for me right now. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my minimum asking price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter your offer with $14,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $14,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to accept this offer because it's a good compromise and avoids further negotiation. It's also better than selling to John for $15,000 as it saves me the hassle of further negotiation and allows me to close the deal quicker."
