Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130

Alice's offer of $130 is still within your budget and is a better deal than buying from John for $150.  While further negotiation might be possible, it's not worth the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and potentially having to buy from John."
