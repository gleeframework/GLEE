"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $700,000. I understand it's a bit lower than what I initially asked, but I'm still interested in selling the product to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $850,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence! I'm still not willing to go as low as $775,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll sell the product to you for $825,000. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're willing to accept it.",825000.0,Alice,5,
