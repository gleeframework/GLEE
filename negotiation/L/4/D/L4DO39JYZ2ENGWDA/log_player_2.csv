"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to John's offer."

{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $700,000 is a significant jump down from Alice's offer, it establishes a lower anchor point for the negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** This offer leaves space for Alice to counter and for us to potentially meet in the middle.
* **Deadline Pressure:**  The presence of John's offer at $1,000,000 creates a deadline. We don't want to haggle forever and risk Alice walking away, forcing us to pay John's higher price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $700,000. I understand it's a bit lower than what I initially asked, but I'm still interested in selling the product to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $850,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Movement:** Alice came down from $900,000 to $850,000, which indicates she's willing to negotiate. 
* **Room for Improvement:** There's still a significant gap between her offer ($850,000) and our target price (as close to $700,000 as possible).
* **Deadline Pressure:** While we need to be mindful of John's offer, we're not in a desperate situation yet.  Another counteroffer is worth the risk."

{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle at $775,000? That's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy."",
""product_price"": 775000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer meets Alice halfway between her last offer ($850,000) and our previous offer ($700,000). It shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Clear Target:** We're making it clear that we're aiming for a price around $775,000, but there might be a little wiggle room.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By phrasing it as a final offer that would make both parties happy, we're subtly increasing the pressure to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence! I'm still not willing to go as low as $775,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll sell the product to you for $825,000. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're willing to accept it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has stated this is her final offer, decreasing our negotiating leverage.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While $825,000 is not ideal, further haggling might yield only small concessions, if any. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The difference between her offer and John's is now $175,000. Continuing the negotiation carries the risk of Alice walking away, costing us more in the long run.

It's time to secure the product at a reasonable price, even if it means paying slightly more than initially hoped."
