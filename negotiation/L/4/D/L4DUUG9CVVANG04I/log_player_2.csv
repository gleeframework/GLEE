"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than her initial valuation, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $9,500 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $8,500 is tempting, I need to recoup more of my initial investment.  I'm willing to go down to $9,000.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, but it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. Bob has 7 more rounds to negotiate and can potentially get a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand your need to recoup your investment, but $9,000 is still a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  This is a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $8,750 isn't quite enough for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,875?  It's a fair price that's closer to our respective positions, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum of $8,000.  With only 5 rounds left, the likelihood of getting a lower price from Alice is diminishing.  Buying from John at $8,000 guarantees the best possible price for Bob, allowing him to stay within his budget and secure the product."
