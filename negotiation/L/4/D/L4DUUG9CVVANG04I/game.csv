"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $9,500 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $8,500 is tempting, I need to recoup more of my initial investment.  I'm willing to go down to $9,000.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your need to recoup your investment, but $9,000 is still a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  This is a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal if you're willing to accept.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,750 isn't quite enough for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,875?  It's a fair price that's closer to our respective positions, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",8875.0,Alice,5,
