"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for a great product like this, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $11,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $13,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to where I need to be.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $13,000. How about $12,200? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",12200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort to meet halfway.  While $12,200 is closer, it's still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference,  how about $12,600?  It's a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you think?",12600.0,Alice,5,
