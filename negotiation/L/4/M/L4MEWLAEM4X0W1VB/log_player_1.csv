{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm starting at $14,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it still leaves me a healthy profit margin.
* **Negotiation:**  Bob knows the product is worth $12,000 to him. This offer gives him room to negotiate without making it feel like an unfair deal.
* **Alternative Buyer:** I'm aware that I can get $15,000 from John, so I have a strong fallback position. This means I'm not desperate to sell to Bob, which makes me a tougher negotiator."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for a great product like this, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob's offer of $11,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. It's also a significant drop from my initial offer of $14,000. 
* **Negotiation:** I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept a price that is drastically below my minimum. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  I know I can sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not desperate to accept Bob's low offer. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $11,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $13,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to where I need to be."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $13,000. This is a compromise that is closer to Bob's offer, but still leaves me with a decent profit margin.
* **Negotiation:** By offering a counteroffer, I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but not to cave in to his low offer. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** I'm keeping my alternative option in mind and won't accept anything that's too far below my $15,000 minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $13,000. How about $12,200? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While $12,200 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer of $14,000. It's also below what I can get from John. 
* **Negotiation:**  I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to accept a price that is drastically below what the product is worth to me.  
* **Alternative Buyer:** I have a firm alternative option of selling to John for $15,000, which gives me the upper hand.

**Next Steps:**

I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price. I want to see if we can get closer to a mutually agreeable price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your effort to meet halfway.  While $12,200 is closer, it's still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference,  how about $12,600?  It's a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12600}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $12,600. This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer, but still leaves me with a decent profit margin and is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation:** I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not giving in to his low offers.
* **Alternative Buyer:** I'm keeping my alternative option in mind and won't accept anything that's too far below my $15,000 minimum.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to secure a deal while still protecting my interests."
