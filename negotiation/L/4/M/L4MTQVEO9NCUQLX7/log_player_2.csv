"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a valuable product that I believe could be a great asset to you. While I value it at significantly more, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This represents a significant discount and allows you to potentially profit from it.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $800,000 for the product. Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is higher than your maximum budget.  Therefore, you should reject her offer and buy the product from John for $800,000."
