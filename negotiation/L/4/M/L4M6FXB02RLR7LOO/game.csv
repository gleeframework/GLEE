"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $110 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. That's still a great price for a product that's worth so much. What do you say?",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $125 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $120?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's the most I can do.",120.0,Bob,4,
