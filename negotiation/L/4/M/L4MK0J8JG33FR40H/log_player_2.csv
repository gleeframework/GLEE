"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to acquire something that's worth a lot to you. I'm thinking of a price of $12,000 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, there's room for negotiation. Bob should reject the offer and try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Given the value I place on the product, I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save a bit of money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $11,500 for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is still better than John's price of $15,000. While Bob could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are small. It's likely Alice is firm on her price, and further negotiation could lead to a breakdown in the deal. Accepting her offer secures the product for a reasonable price."
