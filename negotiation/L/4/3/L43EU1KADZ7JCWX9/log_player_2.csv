"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for a lower price from John. However, it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further to see if a better deal can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. Starting with a counteroffer of $1,100,000 is a significant drop from Alice's offer of $1,300,000. This is a strong starting point for negotiation, as it's still higher than what Alice values the product at ($1,200,000). This strategy could lead to a mutually agreeable price somewhere between $1,100,000 and $1,200,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $1,250,000 is still better than buying from John for $1,500,000. While Bob could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee he'll get a better price. Accepting Alice's offer saves him $250,000 compared to John, which is a significant amount."
