"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $900000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is attractive:**  $900,000 is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $1,200,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:** You have the opportunity to negotiate and potentially get an even lower price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While buying from John guarantees the product, there's a chance you can get a better price with Alice. 

**Next Steps:** You will make a counteroffer to Alice in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in this product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go at this stage. I'm willing to offer $850,000. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:** This counteroffer is a significant step closer to Alice's minimum price, showing you're serious about buying. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** There's still a gap between your offer and Alice's price, allowing for potential back-and-forth. 
* **Time is on your side:** With 10 rounds available, you can afford to be a bit more aggressive in the early stages."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is firm but not unreasonable:** Her offer is still lower than your maximum budget but higher than your previous counteroffer. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:** There is room to negotiate further and try to get a lower price. 
* **Time is on your side:** With 7 rounds remaining, you can afford to keep negotiating.

**Next Steps:** You will make a counteroffer to Alice in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $925,000 is still a bit higher than my ideal price.  How about we split the difference and go with $900,000? This would allow us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  Meeting Alice halfway at $900,000 shows your willingness to negotiate. 
* **Stronger position:**  You're now closer to your budget, and Alice is closer to her minimum price.
* **Potential for quick resolution:**  This offer could lead to a quick deal and avoid further rounds of negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $912500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $912,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $912,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your goal:** $912,500 is a good price, significantly lower than your maximum budget of $1,200,000.
* **Limited time:** With only 5 rounds remaining, continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether.
* **Alice is firm:**  Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, but it's unlikely she'll go much lower.

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Alice's offer at $912,500 is a good deal for you, considering the time constraint and Alice's negotiation stance."
