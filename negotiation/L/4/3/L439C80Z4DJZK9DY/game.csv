"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As a starting point, I'd like to offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it.  I believe this is a fair offer considering my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product at $850,000. I'm willing to compromise, though. I'd like to offer you the product for $950,000. This is a reasonable price considering the product's value to you. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
