Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000.  I know it's valuable to you and I'm aiming for a price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  We know Bob values the product at $10,000.  This gives us a starting point for negotiation.
* **Aiming High:** Starting with a price of $19,000 allows room for negotiation downward while staying significantly above your minimum acceptable price ($15,000). 
* **Justification:** The message to Bob attempts to frame the high price by mentioning ""worth,"" subtly implying value beyond just Bob's immediate need.
* **Backup Plan:** We have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 to John if Bob rejects the offer.

**Important Note:**  There's a chance Bob might accept the $19,000, netting you a significant profit. However,  be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters with a lower offer."
