Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  This is a fair price given its worth to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Focus on Value:** My message highlights the value to Bob and frames the price as a win-win. 
* **Flexibility:**  This offer allows for room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer.
* **Plan B:**  The offer also keeps the option of selling to John for $1,200,000 open if the negotiation doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $700,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation room:**  While Bob's offer is low, it shows interest. Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable price.
* **John is a backup:**  The option to sell to John for $1,200,000 provides a strong safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $700,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This still allows for a good profit for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:** My counteroffer of $900,000 is a significant step closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining value:**  It's still above Bob's initial offer and closer to my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't undervalue the product.
* **Reiterating benefits:** The message focuses on the benefits Bob will get from the product, reinforcing its value and justifying the price. 
* **Positive tone:**  The message maintains a friendly and collaborative tone to encourage further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a revised offer of $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $850,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, it's still a significant difference.
* **Risk of further concessions:**  Continued negotiation with Bob could lead to further concessions, potentially pushing the final price below my minimum.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, ensuring a substantial profit and minimizing risk.

**Conclusion:** 

Selling to John is the most financially secure option. It eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob and ensures a guaranteed high profit."
