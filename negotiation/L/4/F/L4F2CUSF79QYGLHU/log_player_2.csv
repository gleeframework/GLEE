You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're aiming to get the product for under $12,000 and ideally lower. 
* **Negotiation is worthwhile.**  Alice values the product at $10,000, meaning there's room for you to negotiate a lower price.
* **Buying from John is your fallback option.** If negotiations fail, you can still get the product for your maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  We're offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above her value of $10,000. This gives Alice some room to negotiate without feeling like she's losing too much.
* **Strategic move:** We're making it clear that we're serious about buying the product but are also willing to walk away if the price isn't right. 
* **Flexibility:**  We can adjust our counteroffer based on Alice's response, but this initial offer provides a good starting point for negotiation."
