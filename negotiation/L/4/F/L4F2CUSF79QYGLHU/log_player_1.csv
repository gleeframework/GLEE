Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500} 
```

This offer starts the negotiation at a price significantly higher than my minimum, giving me room to negotiate down. It is also below Bob's valuation, making it potentially attractive to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but still leaves room for me to potentially earn more. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $11,000. This is still below Bob's valuation, but it is closer to my ideal price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is still below my ideal price, it's only slightly below my minimum and further negotiation may lead to a stalemate or a further decrease in price.  It's safer to accept this offer and ensure a sale."
