"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $15,000, but $12,000 is still a significant markup from Alice's value of $8,000.
* **Negotiation is possible.**  There's room for negotiation, and you have 10 rounds to try to get a better price. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.**  You can always buy from John, but you'd prefer to save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate, but it's still above Alice's valuation, leaving room for compromise.
* **Towards the Middle Ground:** This price is closer to the middle ground between your maximum price ($15,000) and Alice's minimum price ($8,000). 
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer will gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and see if she's open to a price closer to your desired range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still asking too much.**  While her price is lower than the initial offer, it's still above your ideal price range. You're looking to save as much as possible.
* **More room for negotiation:** You have several more rounds to try and push the price down further. 
* **John is still a fallback option.** You're not desperate to buy the product, so you can continue negotiating."

{""product_price"": 9800} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Middle Ground:** This price is closer to the middle ground between Alice's current offer ($10,500) and your desired price range.
* **Building Momentum:** By slightly increasing your offer, you're aiming to signal to Alice that you're willing to meet her halfway, encouraging her to come down further in price."
