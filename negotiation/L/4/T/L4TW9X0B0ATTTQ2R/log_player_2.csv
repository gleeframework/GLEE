"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice since her offer is significantly lower than what you're willing to pay.  You can try to get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""While I appreciate your offer, I'm hoping to get the product for a bit closer to my budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,000,000?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to get the product for closer to your budget, but I have to consider my own investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1,150,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000 and still leaves room for Alice to make a profit.  It's a good deal for Bob."
