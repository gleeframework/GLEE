Alice's offer is a bit high. There's room to negotiate a lower price that's still beneficial for both of you.  I'll try a counteroffer to see if I can get it closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

Alice met me halfway, and $105 is a reasonable price. It's a good deal compared to John's offer, and it avoids further back-and-forth."
