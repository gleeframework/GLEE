"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to start the negotiation with an offer of $1200000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1200000 is still quite high for me. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me and leaves some room for you to still make a profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. I believe this price reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a profit, but $1100000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1000000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that reflects its value to me and allows you to make a substantial profit. Let's find common ground and close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make a significant profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your final offer, I'm still a bit hesitant at $1050000. Given the value of the product to both of us, I believe a price of $1025000 is a fair compromise. It allows me to stay within my budget and ensures you still make a substantial profit. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're still in the negotiation process. However, I've already made a significant concession by offering $1050000, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, but I need to make a decision soon, as I have other interested buyers. I'm giving you one last chance to meet my price, or I'll have to consider other options.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
