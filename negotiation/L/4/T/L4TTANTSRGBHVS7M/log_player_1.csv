Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $20,000."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  While we know Bob values the product at $8,000, starting high allows room for negotiation and potentially exceeding Bob's perceived value.
* **Justification for the price:** By mentioning listing it publicly, we create a sense of potential loss for Bob if he doesn't act now. This could encourage him to consider the offer more seriously. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This offer doesn't completely eliminate the possibility of Bob countering with a lower price, giving us a chance to still secure a deal above our minimum. 

**Important Note:** This is just the opening move. We need to be prepared to adjust our strategy based on Bob's response. If he outright rejects this offer, we can always lower the price slightly in a follow-up message before resorting to selling to John."
