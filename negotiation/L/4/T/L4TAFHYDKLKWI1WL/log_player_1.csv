Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a fair price that's above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to pay more. I'm confident that I can get a better price than John's offer, but I'm also willing to walk away if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is closer to my desired price, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price point, which is $100. I want to see if Bob is willing to increase his offer before settling for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $95. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. It demonstrates flexibility while still keeping my goal of maximizing my earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still below my initial target, it's very close and I believe further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly higher price. I'm also aware that John is a backup option, and this deal ensures a profit while also preventing further back and forth with Bob."
