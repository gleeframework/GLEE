Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you acknowledging the product's value to me. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This would still be a great deal for you, as it's significantly higher than what it's worth to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
