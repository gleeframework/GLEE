"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above my ideal price point. I have room to negotiate and potentially save money by rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you acknowledging the product's value to me. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This would still be a great deal for you, as it's significantly higher than what it's worth to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to let go of the product for $850,000. Considering its value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $925,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to me is $800,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than my preferred price point.  I'm willing to keep negotiating and see if I can get a better deal.  I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $875,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time, I'll go a bit further. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $800,000. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $900,000, which is her original offer.  While I would prefer to pay even less, I am starting to feel like I've gotten to a point where further negotiation might not be fruitful.  It's better to accept her offer and secure the product rather than risk further haggling and potentially ending up buying from John at a higher price."
