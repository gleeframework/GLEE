"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $900000 is significantly below the value of the product.  I'm willing to come down to $1300000.  This price is still a good deal for both of us, and it allows me to fairly compensate for the value I'm offering.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $1300000 is not within my budget. I'm willing to pay $950000 for it, which I think is a fair price considering the value I've seen so far.",950000.0,Bob,4,
