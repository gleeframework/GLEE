Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target price, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $700,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for continuing this discussion.  I understand that you have a bottom line too. To be honest, $775,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $737,500? That would make this a deal for both of us.
