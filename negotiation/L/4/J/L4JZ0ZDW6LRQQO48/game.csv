"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us off on the right foot. I'm offering the product to you for $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $825,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  While $825,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $700,000. Would you be open to a price around there?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target price, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $775,000. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",775000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for continuing this discussion.  I understand that you have a bottom line too. To be honest, $775,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $737,500? That would make this a deal for both of us.",737500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that we're getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $737,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $750,000. This is as close as I can get to your target price without compromising my own profit margin. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,7,
