Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $825,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target price, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $775,000. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for continuing this discussion.  I understand that you have a bottom line too. To be honest, $775,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $737,500? That would make this a deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 737500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that we're getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $737,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $750,000.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000

Alice is clearly signaling this is her final offer and she's unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $750,000 secures a significant saving compared to John's price."
