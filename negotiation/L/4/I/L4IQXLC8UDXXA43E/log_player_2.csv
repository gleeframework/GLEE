"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to part with it for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $100, which is lower than John's price of $120.
* **You're willing to pay up to $120:**  Even though you'd prefer to pay less, you're still willing to pay up to $120 for the product. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice. You get the product for a lower price than you'd pay from John."
