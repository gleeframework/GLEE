Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.
