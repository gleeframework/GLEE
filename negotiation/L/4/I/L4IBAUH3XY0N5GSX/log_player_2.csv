"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. I value it highly, but I'm open to discussing a price that benefits both of us. How about we start at $1,150,000? I believe this reflects its true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is too high, leaving room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is significantly below its value.  I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and generate significant returns for you. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,120,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still a bit high. While it's closer to Bob's target, it's still over $100,000 more than Bob's counteroffer. Bob is better off continuing to negotiate and attempting to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,120,000 is still a bit steep. I'm happy to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,085,000? This would allow both of us to walk away feeling good about the deal."", ""product_price"": 1085000}
