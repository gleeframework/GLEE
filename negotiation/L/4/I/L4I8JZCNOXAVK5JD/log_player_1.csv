I'm offering the product to Bob for $150. This is a price that is higher than my minimum value of $120, giving me a profit margin.  While I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm hoping he'll see the potential benefit and be willing to pay a bit more. If he rejects the offer, I can always sell it to John for $120, guaranteeing I don't lose money."
