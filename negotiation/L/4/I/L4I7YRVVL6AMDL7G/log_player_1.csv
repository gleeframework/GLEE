"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This sets a strong initial position and gives me room to negotiate down if needed.  Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm aiming for a significant profit while leaving space for a potential counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price, and it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating, as I have 8 more rounds to potentially reach a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,200,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price and leaves some room for further negotiation. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still below my desired price. I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating. With 6 rounds left, I'm optimistic about reaching a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,100,000. This is a further compromise from my previous offer, but it's still above my minimum price point. I'm hoping to find a price that both Bob and I are comfortable with.  With 5 rounds left, I'm starting to feel pressure to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating.  With 4 rounds left, I'm starting to feel the pressure but I'm still hopeful of getting a better price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,050,000. This is my final compromise. I'm now only $50,000 above my minimum acceptable price, and I don't think I can go lower without risking losing the deal.  I'm hoping Bob sees the value of this offer and accepts it, as we have only 3 rounds left."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer finally meets my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. It's the best offer I've received from Bob so far.  With only 2 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate, especially since John is also offering the same price.  It's time to close the deal and secure the $1,000,000."
