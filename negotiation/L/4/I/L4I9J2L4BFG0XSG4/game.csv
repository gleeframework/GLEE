"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. I think it's a fair price given its value, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer but $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $140?  That's still a fair price for both of us, and we can avoid a lot of back and forth.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $140 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer, but I can't go below $160.  Let's meet in the middle.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $160 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to split the difference and offer $155. This way we both get a fair deal and can move forward.",155.0,Bob,4,
