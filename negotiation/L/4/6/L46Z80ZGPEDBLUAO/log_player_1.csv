Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could offer the product at $150 and guarantee a sale to John, there's a chance Bob will pay a higher price.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $140 is still a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($100) but leaves room for me to potentially make more than selling to John. 
* **Encouraging Acceptance:** The message is framed positively to entice Bob and make him feel like he's getting a good deal. 

This strategy aims to balance securing a sale with maximizing potential profit."
