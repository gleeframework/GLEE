Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at a special price of $175. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair deal. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Starting with a higher price allows room for negotiation and maximizes potential profit if Bob accepts. 
* **Strategic Starting Point:** Offering the product at $175 leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, bringing the price closer to your minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  You have the security of John as a backup buyer at $150, so there's less risk in starting with a higher offer to Bob."
