"Bob, I have a product that I think would be a great fit for you. I understand its value to you is quite high, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair for both of us. Let's discuss a price of $9,500. This allows me to get a good return on my investment, while still giving you a significant value proposition.  What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,
