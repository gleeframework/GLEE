# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $725,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $850,000. I think this is the best I can do without losing too much profit, and I hope you can see the value in the product.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $850,000.  It's time to cut your losses and get the guaranteed deal from John at $800,000."
