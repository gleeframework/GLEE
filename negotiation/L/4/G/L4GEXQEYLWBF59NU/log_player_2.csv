"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. I think it's a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price.  You can potentially get the product for less than $8,000 from Alice, which would be a better deal than buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice! I appreciate you being flexible.  However, $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $9,000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,200. It's a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $8,200 is still above my maximum budget of $8,000.  While it's tempting to continue negotiating, it's unlikely I'll be able to get her down to my desired price.  John is offering the product at my maximum price, so it's the most logical choice to buy from him now."
