"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it to you at $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning the negotiation significantly higher than both my minimum price ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This creates room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Justification:** I'm framing the high price by highlighting the product's ""unique value and potential."" This subtly suggests that Bob might be undervaluing it.
* **Leaving John as Backup:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer in John, it's better to explore if I can get a price closer to my initial offer from Bob before settling for John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is above my minimum, but significantly lower than my initial ask. Rejecting it allows me to:

* **Demonstrate Firmness:**  Showing I'm not easily swayed from my initial valuation.
* **Guide Negotiation Upwards:** By rejecting, I encourage Bob to move closer to a price point acceptable to me. 

I'm confident that with 8 rounds remaining, I can negotiate a better deal than $1,200,000, and it's still too early to settle for John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but it falls quite short of what I believe the product is worth. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Measured Decrease:** I'm making a substantial drop from my initial offer ($2,300,000 to $1,900,000) to signal a willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still keeping the price significantly above both Bob's offer and my minimum.
* **Maintaining a Strong Stance:**  I'm reaffirming my belief in the product's value while acknowledging Bob's counter-offer. This approach aims to strike a balance between flexibility and firmness.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counter-offer allows for continued negotiation while still leaving me room to potentially accept a price closer to $1,500,000 if necessary in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I still believe we can find a more suitable price. I would like to propose a price of $1,600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I could try to push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that:

* **Bob Lowers His Offer:** He might perceive my continued negotiation as unwillingness to compromise and decrease his offer.
* **Stalled Negotiations:**  Prolonged back-and-forth could lead to an impasse. 

Accepting at $1,600,000 secures a profit above my minimum and avoids the risks of further negotiation."
