"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in your product, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider something closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? That's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but $750,000 is still significantly below what this product is worth.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is a fair price considering the value I'm offering.  What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  This is my final offer, $800,000.  I understand it's less than you were hoping for, but it's a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal today.",800000.0,Bob,6,
