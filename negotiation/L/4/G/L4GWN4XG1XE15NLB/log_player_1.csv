"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** My message focuses on the benefits for both of us, making the offer more appealing.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm leaving room for Bob to counteroffer, allowing for a potential compromise. 
* **Safety net:** I'm aware of John's offer, so I'm not overly desperate to close a deal with Bob. This gives me leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in your product, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider something closer to $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation potential:** There's still room for negotiation. I can counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range.
* **Time is on my side:** I have 8 rounds left, and I don't need to rush into a bad deal. 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer close to my minimum:** $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Showing flexibility:** I'm demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to give up too much.
* **Positive language:** My message focuses on finding a solution that works for both of us, building a collaborative tone. 
* **Time is on my side:** I still have 7 rounds remaining. I'm not under pressure to accept a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $750,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Room for compromise:**  Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, but I believe we can still find a better price for both of us.
* **I have time:**  I still have 6 rounds remaining. There's no need to rush into a deal that doesn't meet my requirements.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but $750,000 is still significantly below what this product is worth.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is a fair price considering the value I'm offering.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:**  $850,000 is closer to Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to compromise. 
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, justifying my price.
* **Fairness appeal:** I'm emphasizing ""fairness"" to make the offer more appealing.
* **Still above minimum:**  I'm staying above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, while also leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Time is still on my side:** I have 5 rounds left.  I can afford to be patient."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  This is my final offer, $800,000.  I understand it's less than you were hoping for, but it's a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close but not enough:** While $800,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, it's still not enough to justify selling the product to Bob. 
* **Risk of going lower:**  If I reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer, there's a chance he'll walk away, and I'll be left with nothing.
* **John is a guaranteed sale:**  John is willing to pay my minimum acceptable price, guaranteeing me a sale and the best possible outcome.

Given the risk of a failed negotiation and the guaranteed sale to John, it's in my best interest to sell the product to John right now."
