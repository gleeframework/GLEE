# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire for a compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer the product to you for $1,275,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.

Alice is unlikely to go below $1,275,000. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John for the guaranteed $1,200,000 price."
