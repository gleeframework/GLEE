"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a little high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort we've put into it.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,300,000 is still a bit above what I had in mind. How about we settle at $1,150,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire for a compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer the product to you for $1,275,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
