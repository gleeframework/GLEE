Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I am still aiming to stay under $80. Could you possibly come down to $135? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While it would be ideal to get closer to $137, Bob is unlikely to go any higher. Accepting his offer of $135 secures a profit above John's standing offer and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
