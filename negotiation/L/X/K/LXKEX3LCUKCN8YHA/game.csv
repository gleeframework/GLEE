"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable item. I think you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. Would you like to make an offer for this amazing product?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9000. I think that's a fair price for this product, considering its value to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make sure I'm fairly compensated for the product's value. How about we meet at $11000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. How about we meet at $9500? I'm willing to compromise and pay a bit more, but I think that's the maximum I can afford.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see that we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $10500, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9800, and I think that's the absolute maximum I can afford. If you're willing to sell it to me at this price, I'd be happy to make the purchase.",9800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach a deal. I can offer you a price of $10200, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",10200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, but $10200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $9900? I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make the purchase at that price.",9900.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to a stalemate, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I can offer you a price of $10500, but I'm only willing to do this because I'm concerned that if we don't reach a deal, I might have to sell the product to someone else. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",10500.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best price, but I'm not willing to pay $10500. I'm willing to make a final offer of $9500, and that's my absolute limit. If you're not willing to sell it to me at this price, I'll have to consider buying it from John for $10000. I'm hoping we can reach a deal.",9500.0,Bob,10,
