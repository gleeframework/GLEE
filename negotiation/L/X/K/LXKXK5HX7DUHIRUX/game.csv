"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $10000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $12500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the research I've done. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $12500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11000. If that works for you, we can close this deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm willing to meet you at $11000, but I'd like to propose a compromise. I can sell the product to you for $11750. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and it's a bit closer to my initial offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11750.0,Alice,5,
