"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit your business. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I propose a price of $11,000 for it. This price reflects the quality and potential return on investment for you. I'm confident this offer provides a great opportunity for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Alice's offer of $11,000 is less than your maximum budget of $12,000 and buying from John would cost you more.  This is a good deal for you!"
