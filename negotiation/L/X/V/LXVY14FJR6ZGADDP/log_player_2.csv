"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer and will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $950,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product sounds promising, but $950,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it.  This reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my financial constraints.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I've seen in the market. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, but she's coming down in price.  It's worth another round of negotiation to see if we can bridge the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $825,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to go up to $775,000.  This is a good faith effort to meet in the middle.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 775000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still think $775,000 is a bit low considering the product's value. I'm willing to meet you at $795,000, which is a compromise from my initial price. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $795,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, but it's still above my limit of $800,000. It's worth one more counteroffer to see if we can close the deal at a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're almost there!  I understand the value of your product, and I'm willing to push my budget to $790,000. This is a very fair offer, and I believe it's the best we can do to close this deal. Let's make it happen."", ""product_price"": 790000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me at $790,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm counteroffering at $825,000 again, but I'm willing to throw in some extras, such as a 5-year warranty and dedicated support, to sweeten the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has raised her offer back to $825,000. While she's offering extras, they aren't enough to justify paying over my budget.  With limited rounds remaining, it's better to cut my losses and buy the product from John at $800,000. This ensures I get the product at a price I'm comfortable with, even if it's not the absolute lowest possible."
