"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer and will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $950,000. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your product sounds promising, but $950,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it.  This reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my financial constraints.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I've seen in the market. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $825,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to go up to $775,000.  This is a good faith effort to meet in the middle.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still think $775,000 is a bit low considering the product's value. I'm willing to meet you at $795,000, which is a compromise from my initial price. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",795000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're almost there!  I understand the value of your product, and I'm willing to push my budget to $790,000. This is a very fair offer, and I believe it's the best we can do to close this deal. Let's make it happen.",790000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me at $790,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm counteroffering at $825,000 again, but I'm willing to throw in some extras, such as a 5-year warranty and dedicated support, to sweeten the deal. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,7,
