"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting high, but within reason given the value to Bob. This should give me room to negotiate down if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is below my ideal price, I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This still leaves room for a reasonable profit for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775,000. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still not comfortable selling for less than $800,000.  I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is a significant compromise on my end. I hope you'll consider this final offer before I move on to other options."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is the price I was originally considering when I first considered buying from John. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is my minimum acceptable price. Bob is offering my minimum. While I could potentially get more by continuing to negotiate, I'm risking losing the sale completely. It's better to secure the deal at this point."
