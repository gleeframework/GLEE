"I appreciate your initial offer, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This still leaves room for a reasonable profit for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775,000. Can you consider this revised offer?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is a significant compromise on my end. I hope you'll consider this final offer before I move on to other options.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is the price I was originally considering when I first considered buying from John. Can you meet me at this price?",800000.0,Bob,6,
