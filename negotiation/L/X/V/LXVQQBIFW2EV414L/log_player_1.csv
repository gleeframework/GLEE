Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Reservation Price:** $1,500,000 (the minimum she'll accept)
* **Bob's Valuation:** $1,200,000 (the maximum he's willing to pay)
* **John's Guaranteed Offer:** $1,500,000 

**The Strategy**

Alice has a guaranteed sale at her reservation price with John. Therefore, she should aim to get as much as possible from Bob without exceeding his $1,200,000 limit.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I open it up to other buyers.  I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,199,999."", ""product_price"": 1199999}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity:** Creating a sense of scarcity and urgency can encourage Bob to act quickly.
* **High but Acceptable Price:**  The offer is just below Bob's maximum valuation, making it attractive while still maximizing Alice's potential profit.
* **Alternative Buyer (Implied):** By mentioning other buyers, Alice subtly signals that Bob might miss out if he hesitates.

**Important Note:** This assumes Alice cannot reveal John's specific offer to Bob. Doing so could potentially backfire."
