"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This still represents a great value for you, and allows me to get closer to what I need.  What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,750. Can you consider that?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,750 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,900.  This is a fair price for both of us, and allows us to come to an agreement.  Let's make this happen!",8900.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still a bit short. I'm willing to go up to $8,800. Can you meet me at that price?",8800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to go up to $8,800.  I'm going to counter with $8,850.  This is a fair compromise, and it's the best I can do at this point.  What do you say?",8850.0,Alice,7,

"I'm still a bit short of my budget, but I'm willing to meet you at $8,750 one last time. If that's not possible, I'll have to consider other options.",8750.0,Bob,8,
