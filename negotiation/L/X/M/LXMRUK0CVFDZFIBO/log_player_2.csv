"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth to you is $1200000, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'd like to sell it to you for $900000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is significantly better than buying from John for $1,200,000. Even though you value the product at $1,200,000, accepting Alice's offer saves you $300,000."
