"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $10000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* It's always worth exploring if you can get a better deal. Since this is the first round, it's likely Alice is starting with a high price. 
* Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $7,500 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm aiming for a significant discount to start the negotiation. 
* **Reasonable Counter:** $7,500 is a reasonable starting point, leaving room for compromise.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive and friendly tone helps keep the negotiation open."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $7500 is a little low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8500? It's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Alice's offer is better than her initial one, there's still room for negotiation.
* **Goal-Oriented:** I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial counter-offer of $7,500.
* **Strategic Rejection:**  By rejecting, I can keep the pressure on Alice and potentially get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $8,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference at $8,000?  That seems like a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  This shows a willingness to compromise and makes a more reasonable offer.
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  I'm still aiming to get closer to my desired price point.
* **Positive Tone:**  Staying friendly helps keep the negotiation open and collaborative."
