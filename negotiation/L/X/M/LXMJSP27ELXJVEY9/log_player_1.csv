"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm asking for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its true worth."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential of this product, $950,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in making a serious offer of $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, I believe I can still negotiate a better price.  I'm willing to go a bit lower, but not all the way down to $850,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but I believe the product's value justifies a higher price.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  Let's split the difference and make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

We're getting closer, but I'm still aiming for a higher price.  Bob is clearly interested and willing to negotiate, so I'll hold out a bit longer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're getting closer! I appreciate you working with me. How about we settle on $890,000? That feels like a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 890000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting very close.  I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $880,000.  This feels like a fair price that respects both our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob is clearly trying to meet in the middle, and $880,000 is a strong offer. It's a significant profit above my minimum, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether."
