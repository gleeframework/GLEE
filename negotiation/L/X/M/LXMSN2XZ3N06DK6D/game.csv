"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $1500000. It's a fair offer, considering its value to me, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1500000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $800000. I hope this aligns better with your valuation and allows us to move forward with a mutually beneficial transaction.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're working with a tight budget, but I have to prioritize my own valuation of the product. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1100000. It's a compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, but I'm willing to be flexible to find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, given my financial situation, I am unable to meet the $1100000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950000. I hope this proposal will allow us to reach a fair agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a middle ground. I'm proposing a price of $1050000. It's still a compromise, but I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your latest counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your efforts to find a common ground. I am willing to meet you at $1000000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us considering the value of the product and my budget constraints. I hope this proposal will lead to a successful conclusion of our negotiation.",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your proposal, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1000000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a better price. I'm proposing a price of $1075000. It's still a compromise, but I believe it's closer to my original valuation of the product.
