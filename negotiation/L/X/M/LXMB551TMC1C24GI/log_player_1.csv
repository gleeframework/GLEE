Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value and would be a great asset to you."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves a small window for Bob to negotiate down slightly, while still ensuring Alice gets a price significantly higher than her minimum ($10,000).
* **Backup Option:** Alice has a guaranteed sale at $10,000 from John if Bob refuses. This knowledge empowers Alice to aim higher with Bob."
