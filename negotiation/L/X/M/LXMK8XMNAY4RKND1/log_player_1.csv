"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for the majority of the potential profit.  Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob,  he has room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,300,000 is a good deal, it's still lower than my desired profit margin. I will try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm going to counter with a price of $1,350,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his last offer, but still ensuring I make a profit above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,280,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a slightly better offer.  There's still a chance Bob will increase his offer further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1320000}
```

I'm going to counter with a price of $1,320,000.  I'm slowly decreasing my offer, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my desired profit margin.  We're getting closer to a deal, and I believe Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,290,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,290,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price.  I am  risk-averse at this point, and there's no guarantee that Bob will come up in the next round. It's better to secure a deal than risk losing the sale entirely."
