"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 just doesn't work for me.  How about $110? It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $105 is still a bit low for me.  How about $112? It's a fair compromise that will allow us both to get what we need.",112.0,Alice,5,
