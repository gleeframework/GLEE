Bob is firm on his offer of $1,000,000, which is still too far below my desired price.  While I could continue negotiating, I don't want to risk losing too much time and potentially end up with a worse deal.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees me a much higher profit, so I'm going to take that option."
