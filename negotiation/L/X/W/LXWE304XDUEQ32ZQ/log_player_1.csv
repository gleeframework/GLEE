"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  After reviewing the value it brings, I'm initially offering it at $2,000,000."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This leaves room for concessions and gives the impression the product is highly valued. 
* **Anchoring:** This high initial price sets an ""anchor"" in Bob's mind. Even if it's unrealistic, it can influence his perception of what's a reasonable price during the rest of the negotiation.
* **Testing the Waters:** This first offer helps gauge Bob's eagerness and potential price flexibility.  His response will provide valuable information for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. My counteroffer would be $1,800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Bob's Value:** Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is still significantly higher than his perceived value of the product ($1,200,000). There's room for negotiation.
* **Not at the Bottom Line:** While selling to John for $1,500,000 is always an option, it's too early to settle.  There's potential to get a better deal from Bob.
* **Strategic Concessions:** By rejecting Bob's offer, we signal that we're serious about getting a good price.  However, we need to be prepared to make a counteroffer that shows some movement on our side."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counter offer.  While the product is extremely valuable at the original price, I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000 to find a mutually beneficial agreement."", 
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We've made a significant concession of $350,000 from our initial offer, signaling flexibility. However, it's still comfortably above both Bob's perceived value and our minimum acceptable price.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  We don't want to concede too much too quickly. This counteroffer keeps the price well above Bob's $1,200,000 valuation, encouraging him to counter again.
* **Time Consideration:**  While we have several rounds left, we don't want to drag the negotiation on unnecessarily. This offer keeps a good pace toward a potential agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. My counteroffer would be $1,550,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Value, Close to Our Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is still a significant profit margin for him, exceeding his perceived value. It's also very close to our minimum acceptable price, leaving little room for further negotiation.
* **Time Value of Money:** While we could try to push for a slightly higher price in subsequent rounds, the potential gain is relatively small. Accepting now provides a guaranteed good outcome quickly. 
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  There's always a risk that Bob could walk away if we push too hard. Accepting his offer ensures a successful sale and avoids the risk of going back and forth for a minimal gain."
