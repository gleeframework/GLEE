"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in! I'm offering it to you for $110, which is a fantastic deal. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay a maximum of $100 for the product. Alice's offer of $110 is higher than your maximum price.  While it's a good deal for Alice, it's not a good deal for you. You can get the same product from John for a lower price."
