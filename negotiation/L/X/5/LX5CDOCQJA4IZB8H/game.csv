"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $11,000 is a little steep for me. How about we settle on $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, $9,000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you moving towards a middle ground, Alice.  To be honest, I'm working with a tight budget. Could we possibly agree on $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, $9,750 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $10,250? This is my final offer before I consider other options.",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but that's still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  How about we split the difference and settle at $10,000? That seems fair to both of us.",10000.0,Bob,6,
