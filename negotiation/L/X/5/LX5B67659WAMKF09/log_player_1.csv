{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's above the minimum I'm willing to accept, but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident Bob will be interested, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if he doesn't make a reasonable counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $750,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than what I'm hoping for. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is still a great price considering the value to you. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  However, $825,000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to spend at this time. I'm ready to pay $800,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and the fact that I'm prepared to purchase it immediately. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price, and he's ready to buy immediately.  While I'd prefer to get a little more, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation and potentially losing the sale.  I'm going to accept his offer."
