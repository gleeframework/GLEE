"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,000,000. I'm confident this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,000,000 price point. I would like to propose an alternative that might be more within our mutual interests. How about we consider a price of $900,000 for the product?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm motivated to find a solution that works for both of us, $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your budget considerations.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but unfortunately, $950,000 is still beyond my current budget. I would like to propose a price closer to $850,000, which I believe is a fair compromise between the product's value and my financial constraints.",850000.0,Bob,4,
