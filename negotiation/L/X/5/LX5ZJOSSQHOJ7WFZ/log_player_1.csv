Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you would find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $115."",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:**  Bob values the product at $120. Aiming slightly below his maximum valuation increases the likelihood of him accepting while still securing a good profit for you.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a fallback option with John at $100, but selling to Bob at $115 is more profitable.
* **Single Offer Strategy:**  In this scenario, you have one chance to make an offer to Bob. A strong initial offer that balances profit and the chance of acceptance is ideal."
