Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire this product."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible while ensuring the deal is still very attractive to him.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting a bit high allows room for Bob to counter-offer if he wishes, potentially leading to a final price that's still very favorable for you.
* **Confidence:** The tone of the message projects confidence in the product's value, reinforcing Bob's perception of its worth. 

By setting the price at $925,000, we aim to capture a significant portion of the potential profit while still giving Bob a compelling reason to buy now rather than risk missing out."
