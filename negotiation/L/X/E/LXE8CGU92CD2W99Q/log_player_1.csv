Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

This offer represents a significant profit for you, as it is higher than Bob's perceived value of the product. However, it also leaves room for negotiation, as it is lower than your minimum acceptable price. This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize your potential profit:** A $1.2 million price point is a good starting point for negotiations.
* **Encourage Bob to counteroffer:** Leaving space for negotiation shows your willingness to compromise while still pursuing a high price.
* **Maintain a strong bargaining position:**  You are not selling the product for less than your minimum, so you have room to reject counteroffers if necessary. 

By starting with a higher price, you can try to maximize your earnings while still keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm not willing to sell the product for such a significant loss. 

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my minimum or at least a price that brings me closer to my desired profit margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

This counteroffer is still above Bob's offer but represents a compromise from my initial proposal. This strategy aims to:

* **Show flexibility:** Demonstrating willingness to negotiate can encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price.
* **Stay within a reasonable range:** A $1 million price point keeps the negotiation viable while still protecting my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Maintain a firm position:** By rejecting Bob's initial offer, I've established my commitment to achieving a better price. 

By proposing a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer but still maintains a significant profit for me, I aim to find a middle ground that will lead to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm disappointed that Bob isn't willing to meet my desired price point, it's clear that he's not going to go much higher than his current offer.  I've already rejected his counteroffer, and it's likely that further negotiations will be unproductive. 

To avoid further risk of a low-profit deal or a complete loss, I will sell the product to John for $1,500,000. This ensures I meet my minimum acceptable price and guarantee a significant profit."
