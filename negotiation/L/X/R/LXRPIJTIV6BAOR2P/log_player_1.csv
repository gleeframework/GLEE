Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible without losing the sale.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **High but Reasonable:** $1,100,000 provides a substantial profit margin while still seeming reasonable to Bob, considering he values the product at $1,200,000.

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes Alice has no way of knowing for certain Bob's absolute maximum willingness to pay. If she had more information, the offer could be adjusted for even greater profit."
