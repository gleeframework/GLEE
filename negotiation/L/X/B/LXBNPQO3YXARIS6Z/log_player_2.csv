"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000.  It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it's worth every penny to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your budget, and you are aiming to save as much money as possible. Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate a better price in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for your product. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by making a significant price reduction. It signals your seriousness in buying the product but also leaves room for further negotiation.  $1,100,000 is a good starting point as it's still above your maximum budget, but leaves a considerable margin for bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. I'm now offering the product for $1,250,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your target, it's still above your maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows for continued negotiation and potentially securing a better price.  You can also consider that John's offer is just slightly higher than Alice's current offer, and you may be able to secure a lower price from Alice in future rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer again shows your willingness to compromise while still staying below your maximum budget. The offer is a moderate increase from your previous counteroffer, showing that you are negotiating in good faith. It leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm confident the product is worth more than that to you. I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,200,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 matches your maximum budget. You have successfully negotiated a price that is within your budget. While you could continue negotiating, there is a risk that Alice will reject your next offer or that you will run out of rounds before reaching an agreement.  Accepting the offer ensures you secure the product at a favorable price and avoids the risk of losing the deal."
