"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. I'm now offering the product for $1,250,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm confident the product is worth more than that to you. I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,200,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
