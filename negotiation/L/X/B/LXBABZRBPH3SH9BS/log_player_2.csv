{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$20,000 is far too high. It's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6000}
``` 
This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, and it's a starting point for negotiation. I'm aiming to get the price closer to my maximum value of $8000."

$18,000 is still too high.  I'll continue negotiating with Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}

I'm increasing my offer to $7,000, getting closer to my maximum while still leaving room for negotiation.  I'm hoping this demonstrates my serious intent to buy, but also pushes Alice to consider a lower price."

While Alice is coming down, $16,500 is still above my limit. I'll continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

I'm increasing my offer again, but only slightly.  I want to show I'm serious, but also that I'm not willing to go much higher.  Hopefully, this will get us closer to a deal."

$16,000 is still too high.  I'm getting closer to my limit, but I'm not ready to buy yet. I'll continue to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7800}
```

I'm getting close to my maximum, so I'm raising my offer to $7800. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Alice to come down to a price that works for both of us."

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's clear that Alice is unwilling to come down to my desired price range.  I've tried negotiating with her, but she's not budging.  To avoid risking running out of rounds, I'll buy from John."
