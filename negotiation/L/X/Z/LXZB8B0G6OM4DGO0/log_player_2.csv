"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $10,000 by us. Considering its high quality and unique features, we believe it would be worth $9,500 to you. We hope this offer aligns with your expectations and look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are aiming to get the product for as close to $8,000 as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $9,500 is too high.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's quality, $9,500 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. After careful consideration, I understand your position and am willing to negotiate further. I am proposing a revised price of $9,000 for the product. This still reflects its value to us, while making it more accessible to you. Please let me know if this offer suits your needs.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is closer to your target price of $8,000, it's still not quite there. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if you can get Alice down to your desired price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate further. However, $9,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $8,750. It's a fair price that recognizes the product's value while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8750}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued willingness to negotiate, Bob. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually beneficial solution. Based on our discussions, I am pleased to offer the product to you at a price of $8,900. This reflects the value of the product while accommodating your budget constraints. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,900 is very close to your target price of $8,000.  While you could continue to negotiate, there is a risk that Alice will reject your next counteroffer and you'll be forced to buy from John at $8,000.  At this point, accepting Alice's offer saves you $100 compared to buying from John, making it the better option."
