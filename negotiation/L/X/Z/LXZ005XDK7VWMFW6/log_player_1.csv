Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,999. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice's goal is to get as much money as possible. Since she has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, she should aim slightly lower to entice Bob.
* **Appeal to Value:** The message highlights the product's value, subtly justifying the high price.
* **Urgency:**  While not overly aggressive, implying that the offer is time-sensitive might encourage Bob to act quickly. 
 
**Why this strategy?**

This offer creates a win-win situation if Bob accepts:

* **Alice:** Earns a profit close to her maximum potential ($14,999) and avoids potential delays with another buyer.
* **Bob:** Saves $1 (which is better than nothing) and acquires a product he values.

If Bob rejects the offer, Alice is still in a strong position with John as a backup."
