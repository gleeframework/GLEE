Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

Bob's offer:

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is the best move at this point. Here's why:

* **Profitable:**  $1,600,000 is still significantly more than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing negotiations risks pushing Bob away and potentially getting a worse offer or no deal at all. John's offer is my safety net, but securing a profit with Bob now is preferable. 
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal sooner allows me to reinvest the earnings faster."
