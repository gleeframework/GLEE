"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something that's worth $12,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000, which I think is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to inflate the perceived value of the product to you. While it might be worth $12,000 to you, it's important to negotiate from a position of strength. You have a backup option with John at $12,000, so there's no rush to accept an inflated price."
