"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$5,000 is far too low for me.  I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm reducing my price from the initial offer, but still aiming for a price that's significantly higher than Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while still holding onto a good amount of profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $4,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $4,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but if his offers don't improve significantly, I'll consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to make a significant drop in price to try to get Bob closer to my desired price.  It's a gamble, but if Bob's truly interested, this offer might be too good to pass up."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $3,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $3,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offers are getting increasingly unreasonable.  While I'd prefer to make a larger profit, it's becoming clear that he's not willing to pay a fair price. Selling to John for $10,000 ensures I at least meet my minimum price and avoid a loss."
