"Alice, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in this product, but my maximum budget is $10,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $20,000 is already a very competitive price for this product and its value. I could be willing to meet you halfway. How about $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway on our numbers - how about $12,500?  This is a fair price that's within my budget, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to be fair to myself as well.  $14,000 is my final offer. It's a great deal for a product of this quality.",14000.0,Alice,5,
