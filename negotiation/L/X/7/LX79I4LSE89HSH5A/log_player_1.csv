Round 2
Bob's offer:

While $1,200,000 is a significant investment, it falls short of what I envision for this deal.  Could you consider $1,900,000?

Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At $1,600,000, Bob's offer exceeds my minimum acceptable price and provides a significant profit. While I could push for more, there's a risk he'll lower his offer or walk away in the next rounds. Accepting now secures a good deal."
