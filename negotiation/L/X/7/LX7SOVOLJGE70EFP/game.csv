"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $165. What do you think?",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $165 is still outside my budget. I'm happy to pay $140, which is a fair compromise.  What do you say?",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to meet you at $155. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",155.0,Alice,5,
