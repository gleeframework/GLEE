You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is a good deal compared to John's $10,000 offer, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to Alice's value of $8,000.  Offering $8,500 is a reasonable starting point, leaving room for potential negotiation.  This shows Alice that Bob is serious about getting a good deal, while still leaving a potential profit for her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is only slightly better than her initial offer. Bob is still aiming for a price closer to $8,500. Rejecting allows him to keep negotiating and potentially get a better deal. While the risk of running out of rounds and having to buy from John exists, Bob is determined to get the best price possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to slowly inch closer to his target price. This counteroffer is a modest increase from the previous one, signaling his willingness to negotiate but also his desire to stay below the $9,000 mark. This approach keeps the negotiation moving forward while maintaining pressure on Alice to come down in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,400

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is slightly better than her previous one, it's still far from Bob's target price. Bob has 5 rounds left and is committed to getting the best possible deal.  Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to his desired price. There is still a chance to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8900} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is inching closer to Alice's potential profit margin. He is showing he is willing to negotiate, but still wants a price closer to his ideal value. This counteroffer is a small step up from the previous one, but it's also still significantly lower than Alice's current offer. Bob is trying to gauge how much further Alice is willing to come down. With 4 rounds left, time is running out, but there's still potential to get a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While the time is getting short, Bob is still committed to getting the best possible price. Alice's offer is closer to Bob's ideal price, but he believes he can still get a better deal. Rejecting this offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to his target price. Even with only 3 rounds left, the potential savings justify the risk."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a final push towards a price he's willing to accept. He's raised his offer slightly, showing that he's serious about closing the deal, but he's still staying below Alice's current offer. With only 2 rounds remaining, this counteroffer puts pressure on Alice to accept or risk losing the deal entirely.  If Alice rejects, Bob will have to decide whether to accept her final offer or buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the final round of negotiation with Alice.  While Bob would ideally get a lower price, Alice's offer of $9,800 is close enough to his target price and significantly better than buying from John for $10,000. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price and avoids the risk of having to buy from John.  It's a good compromise that allows both parties to walk away with a successful outcome."
