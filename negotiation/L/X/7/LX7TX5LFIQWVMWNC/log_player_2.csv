* Rejecting allows you to attempt negotiation and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm offering a price slightly above Alice's minimum value ($1,000,000). 
* This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point for negotiation,  giving Alice some room to bargain while still saving me a significant amount compared to the initial price or buying from John."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Alice's offer is $1,150,000, which is still within my budget of $1,200,000.
* It's a good price considering my initial counteroffer was rejected. 
*  There's no guarantee I can get a better price with further negotiation, and there's a risk Alice might become unwilling to negotiate further.
* Accepting this offer secures the product at a good price, saving me $50,000 compared to buying from John."
