Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision promptly."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you start negotiations significantly above Bob's perceived value. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's high value without revealing your bottom line.
* **Urgency:**  Creating a sense of urgency might push Bob to make a quicker decision. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob counters.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still offering Bob a price that's potentially attractive compared to him losing the opportunity entirely."
