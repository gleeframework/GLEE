"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from your minimum price, but still leaves room for negotiation. The message is friendly and emphasizes the value the product offers to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum price, and even lower than his own perceived value of the product. There's still room for negotiation, so it's better to keep pushing for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply too low.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to go down to $850,000.  This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what the product is worth to me."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to go up to $750000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is closer to your minimum price, you can still do better. Bob is demonstrating a willingness to negotiate, and you can try to push him a bit further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is still quite a bit lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to come down to $800,000, which is the bare minimum I can accept. It's a fair compromise and gives you a good deal. Let's finalize this, I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 800000}
