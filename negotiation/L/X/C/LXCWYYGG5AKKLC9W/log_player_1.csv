"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This gives Bob a good starting point, but also allows for some wiggle room for me to negotiate if needed.  I'm confident I can get at least my minimum of $100, and hopefully, I can get closer to my ideal price with some back and forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $100, which is its minimum value to me. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $110. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It's still above my minimum price, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair price and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $105 is a good deal for me. It's above my minimum price of $100 and  it's likely I won't get a better offer from him. I'm also running out of rounds. While I'd ideally like to sell for more, accepting this offer seems like the best choice to maximize my earnings at this point."
