"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1050000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, but I think it's a fair compromise given the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer, so I'll sell the product to you for $1000000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great compromise. Let me know if this works for you.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
