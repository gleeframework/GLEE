"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation but still ensures I make a profit."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $80 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's a slight increase, it's still not close enough to my desired price. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for a much better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm lowering my price again to $95.  This is a significant concession, but I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and accept this offer. I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds, but I'm determined to get the best price possible."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my desired price.  I have a few rounds left and I think I can push for a higher price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 92}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $92.  I'm running out of time and this is my last chance to make a significant offer to Bob. I'm hoping he'll recognize that this is a fair price, considering the value of the product and the limited time we have left. If he rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $120. Bob's offers haven't been increasing significantly enough to justify continuing the negotiation, and I only have two rounds left.  While I would have preferred to get a higher price, selling to John guarantees my minimum desired profit."
