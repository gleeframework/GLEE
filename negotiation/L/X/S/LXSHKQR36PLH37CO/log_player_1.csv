Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,900,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product,  given its value to me. This price is fair and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While $1,900,000 represents the high end of the product's value, I understand your perspective on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000?

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping for a better deal. Given my initial offer of $1,300,000, how about we meet at $1,400,000? This price is a fair compromise and would allow for a profitable transaction for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

Bob is unlikely to move much higher and it's better to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John than to risk a lower offer from Bob in the next round."
