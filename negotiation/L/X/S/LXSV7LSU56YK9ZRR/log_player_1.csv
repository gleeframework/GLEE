Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I believe it offers excellent value, even at this price.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay even slightly more.
* **Appeal to Value:** The message frames the price as potentially high but emphasizes the product's ""excellent value.""
* **Just Below Guarantee:**  $11,999 is just below your guaranteed price, making it more likely Bob will accept rather than risking losing the opportunity."
