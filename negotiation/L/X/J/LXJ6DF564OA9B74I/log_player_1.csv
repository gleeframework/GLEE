{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll really love. I'm asking for $120 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum ($80) but still lower than Bob's perceived value ($150). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm using a friendly tone to build rapport and encourage Bob to negotiate.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the product's value to make the price seem more reasonable.

**Next Steps:**

I'll analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his reaction. If he rejects my offer, I'll be prepared to make counteroffers, always keeping my minimum price in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob's offer of $90 is still above my minimum of $80, but it's significantly closer to it.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my desired price. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  I believe there's room for a higher price.  Bob expressed interest, indicating he's willing to pay more than my minimum.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than his offer, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there yet. How about we split the difference and go with $100? I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:**  I'm counteroffering at $100, which is halfway between my previous offer of $120 and Bob's offer of $90. This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Negotiation Language:** I'm using language like ""split the difference"" and ""fair price"" to suggest a collaborative approach to the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I'll be prepared to negotiate further, considering Bob's response and adjusting my strategy accordingly. I'll keep in mind my minimum price of $80 and the potential to sell to John for that amount if a deal with Bob can't be reached."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  It's a nice product, but $100 is still a little more than I was hoping to spend. How about we settle at $95? That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Goal:** Bob's offer of $95 is very close to my desired price range and significantly higher than my minimum of $80. 
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:** If I reject his offer, there's a risk he'll walk away, and I'll be left with selling to John for a much lower price.
* **Compromise is Key:**  The negotiation has reached a point where a slight compromise is necessary to secure the deal.

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale. This outcome allows me to maximize my earnings while minimizing the risk of losing the sale altogether."
