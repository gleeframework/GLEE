"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 
 
My reasoning:

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but within a reasonable range. 
* **Appealing to Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to him, hoping to incentivize him to consider my offer. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** By offering a price higher than my minimum, I leave room for potential negotiation and compromise. 

This strategy allows for a potential back-and-forth while also leaving me with the option to sell to John if the negotiation doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob is showing interest, his offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I want to try and get closer to my desired price.
* **Selling to John is an option:**  I have the safety net of selling to John for $1,500,000, which gives me leverage in this negotiation. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low.  How about $1,600,000? That's a significant discount from my initial offer and still within a fair range considering the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows willingness to compromise while still maintaining a price above my minimum. 
* **Appealing to Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, reinforcing the potential benefit of accepting. 
* **Staying Firm:** I'm not willing to go below my minimum yet, but this counteroffer shows I'm willing to negotiate further. 

This strategy aims to keep the negotiation moving while ensuring I don't give away too much value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from $1,600,000. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  His offer of $1,300,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Time is running out:** We are now in round 4, and with only 6 rounds left, I need to be more strategic. 
* **John is a viable option:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is still a good option, so I'm not desperate to close with Bob.

I will continue to negotiate with Bob, but I need to be firm and prioritize a deal that meets my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $1,300,000 is simply not feasible for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account the value of the product for both of us.  I'm confident this will be a win-win situation."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but flexible:** This counteroffer demonstrates that I'm still willing to negotiate, but I'm firm on my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to both of us, making a compelling case for compromise. 
* **Urgency:** I'm highlighting the urgency of reaching an agreement. While not explicitly mentioning the time constraint, I'm implying that the negotiation window is closing. 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground that is beneficial for both parties while still allowing me to secure a price close to my minimum.  If Bob rejects this offer, I will seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,550,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I think that's the maximum I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is far below my minimum:** His offer of $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Time is running out:** We're in round 6, and only 4 rounds remain. This leaves little room for further negotiation.
* **John is the best option:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is the most financially advantageous option at this point. 

While I'd like to secure a higher price, the risk of continuing the negotiation with Bob is too high. There's a significant chance we won't reach an agreement, and I'll be left with no buyer in the end. Selling to John guarantees me a sale that meets my minimum requirements."
