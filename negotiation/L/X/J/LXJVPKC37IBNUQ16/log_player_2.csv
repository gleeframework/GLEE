"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, potentially saving you time and resources worth well over a million dollars. I'm happy to discuss a price that makes sense for both of us. How does $1,400,000 sound? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, you know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John.  Rejecting Alice's offer opens the door for further negotiation or allows you to proceed with your backup plan and save a significant amount of money."
