"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire something that will greatly benefit your business. As we start the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $800,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm aiming for a more competitive price point. Would you consider $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire for a competitive price, but I'm afraid I can't accept $500,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $750,000. I believe this is a more reasonable compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $750,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. Could we settle somewhere around $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I still believe the product's value warrants a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, at $725,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",725000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $650,000.  I believe this is a fair offer, reflecting both the product's value and my budget.",650000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm not willing to go below $700,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's worth to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, and I think this is the best compromise we can reach.",700000.0,Alice,7,
