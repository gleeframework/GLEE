Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $15,000 to me, I'll make an offer that's slightly higher than that to leave some room for negotiation.

Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": 18,000}

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's making a counteroffer of $15,000. Since $15,000 is the minimum value I'm willing to accept, I think I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product to him for $15,000.
