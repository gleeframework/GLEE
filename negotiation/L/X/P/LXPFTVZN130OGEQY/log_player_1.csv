"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to get as close to my minimum price of $150 as possible without losing the deal to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think we can come to an agreement closer to my budget. I am willing to pay $125 for the product.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than $150, and I have another buyer waiting. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but $125 is just too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $150? It's still a great deal for you, and it's the lowest I can go."", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

I'm still not comfortable with selling for $130. I'm going to make a counteroffer in the next round. I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $130 is closer, I'm still not able to go that low. How about $140? That's a good compromise, and it's still a great value for you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my minimum price of $150, I'm still not willing to sell for $135. I'm going to try one more counteroffer in the next round before I consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I think we're getting close! I'm willing to come down to $145. It's still a good deal for both of us, and it allows me to stay above my minimum. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 145}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8

# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I would like to propose $140 as my final offer for the product.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $140 is the closest he's come to my minimum price of $150.  Although I'd prefer to get $150,  it's getting late in the negotiation process and I'm worried that John might make a counteroffer.  I'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
