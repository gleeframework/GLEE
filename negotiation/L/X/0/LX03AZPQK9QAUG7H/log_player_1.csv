Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth to you.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay even more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below your guaranteed price ($1,450,000) creates a sense of urgency and value for Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves a small margin for potential negotiation with Bob if he counters."
