"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 950000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, but still leaving some room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is serious about buying and if he's willing to pay close to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $850,000, I believe I can still get closer to my target price.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to show good faith and encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price. I'm still confident I can secure a higher price than John's offer, especially with only 7 rounds left."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting lower, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not ready to sell to John just yet. I'll keep trying to negotiate with Bob. There are still 6 rounds left, and I believe I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but only slightly. This shows Bob that I'm serious about selling to him, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my desired value.  I'm hoping this compromise will encourage him to raise his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only 4 rounds remaining, Bob's offers are getting increasingly lower, and I'm starting to run out of time. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not willing to go below my minimum acceptable price.  Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000 to ensure I get at least my minimum value."
