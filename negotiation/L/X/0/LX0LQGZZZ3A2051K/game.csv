"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000? I think that's a fair price.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to $13,000 to make this work.  What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you can't go as low as $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? That's a reasonable compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but $11,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12,500?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",12500.0,Alice,5,
