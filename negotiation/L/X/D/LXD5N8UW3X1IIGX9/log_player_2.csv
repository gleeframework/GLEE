"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the significant benefit it offers to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  

By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can still acquire the product from John, albeit at a higher price. This strategy minimizes his losses compared to accepting Alice's offer."
