"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a valuable asset, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. Let's discuss this further."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is definitely interesting, but I'm only willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price, selling to John for $1,200,000 would mean leaving $100,000 on the table. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. My product is worth a lot more than that. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
