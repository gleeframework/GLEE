Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $19,000.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your desired price, leaving room for potential negotiation.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""value and potential"" of the product helps justify the high asking price, even if Bob doesn't subjectively value it that high.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  By mentioning listing the product publicly, Alice subtly hints that Bob might miss out if he doesn't act, even though John is her backup.

**Goal:**

Ideally, Alice wants Bob to counter-offer. This allows her to gauge Bob's interest and potentially settle on a price between $15,000 and $19,000. If Bob rejects the offer outright, Alice has John as a guaranteed buyer at her minimum acceptable price."
