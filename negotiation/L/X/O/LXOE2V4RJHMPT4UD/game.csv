"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $600,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $900,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you coming down, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about $700,000? I think that's a fair price and reflects my budget for this product.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. I can see you're serious about the product, so I'll make one more counteroffer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great compromise. If you're not interested, I'll have to consider other options.",850000.0,Alice,5,
