"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that holds significant value, and I believe it could be a game-changer for your business.  I'm confident that its worth to you is well above $1000000, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000. This is a substantial discount from its true market value, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential benefits it offers.  Let me know your thoughts.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum budget.  Since you have a guaranteed alternative from John at the same price, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer. You have no incentive to accept a deal that offers no additional benefit."
