"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that holds significant value, and I believe it could be a game-changer for your business.  I'm confident that its worth to you is well above $1000000, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000. This is a substantial discount from its true market value, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential benefits it offers.  Let me know your thoughts. ",1500000.0,Alice,1,
