{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $950,000 is a good deal compared to John's offer, there's room for negotiation.  By rejecting, Bob can try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer was $950,000 and the product is worth $800,000 to her.  Offering $850,000 is a significant discount and a reasonable starting point for negotiations.  This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying the product but wants a price closer to Alice's minimum acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is slightly better than her initial offer but still higher than what Bob aims for.  By rejecting, Bob can try to negotiate further and potentially secure a lower price.  He still has 7 rounds remaining before having to consider buying from John."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is $975,000, but Bob wants to keep the price below $950,000.  By offering $900,000, Bob is showing a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a significant saving compared to John's offer. This counteroffer is closer to Alice's last offer, signaling that Bob is ready to close the deal but needs a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering $987,500, which is very close to Bob's maximum price. However, Bob is determined to get a lower price and save as much money as possible.  Offering $925,000 is a significant compromise, but it still allows Bob to save a substantial amount compared to John's offer. This counteroffer shows Bob's willingness to negotiate and meet Alice halfway, while still pushing for a price that benefits him. With four rounds remaining, Bob needs to be strategic and find a price that both parties are willing to accept."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting very close to Bob's maximum price of $1,000,000. However, Bob is still determined to save as much money as possible.

Offering $940,000 is a compromise, but it still allows Bob to save a significant amount compared to John's offer. This counteroffer shows that Bob is willing to negotiate and meet Alice halfway, but he still wants a price that benefits him.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now $998,125, which is only $1,875 less than John's offer.  With only one round left, the chances of getting a lower price from Alice are slim.  The risk of rejecting and ending up with John's higher price outweighs the potential benefit of saving an additional $1,875. It's time to accept and secure the product."
