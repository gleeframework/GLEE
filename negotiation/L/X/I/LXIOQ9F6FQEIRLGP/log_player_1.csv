Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for more than your $10,000 minimum.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob has room to counteroffer, keeping the negotiation going. 
* **It's below Bob's value:**  It's attractive to Bob, giving him a potential profit.

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below your minimum:** You've established a floor of $10,000, and his offer is below that.
* **There's still room for negotiation:**  Bob is clearly interested, and you can likely get a better price. 
* **Selling to John is a fallback:** You can always go to John for $10,000, but you want to maximize your profit.

By rejecting his offer, you can make a counteroffer closer to your desired price and continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While I'm happy to negotiate, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  $11,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming a bit lower. How about $10,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below your minimum:** While closer, $10,750 is still under your desired $10,000 floor.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  Bob clearly wants the product, and a small counteroffer could potentially close the deal.
* **John is a backup:**  Selling to John is always an option, but it's not the best outcome.

By rejecting Bob's offer, you can make a counteroffer closer to your preferred price and potentially reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
