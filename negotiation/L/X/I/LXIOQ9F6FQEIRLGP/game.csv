"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While I'm happy to negotiate, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, Alice.  $11,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming a bit lower. How about $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $10,750 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $10,875. This is a fair price that's close to your offer and still allows me to make a profit. What do you say?",10875.0,Alice,5,
