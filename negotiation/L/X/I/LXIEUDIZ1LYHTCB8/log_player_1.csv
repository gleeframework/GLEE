Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $950,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$950,000:**  This is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation, but still a good deal for Bob.
* **Message:**  I've included a friendly and persuasive message to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 

By starting high and leaving room for negotiation, I increase the likelihood of a successful deal while maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850000 for the product.  It's a fair price given your valuation and it allows for some room for profit on your end. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'd like to get.  There's room for negotiation.  By rejecting his offer, I can try to push for a higher price in a counteroffer.  

I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I can potentially get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $900,000?  This would still give you a significant profit, and it's closer to what the product is worth to me.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$900,000:** This is a compromise, meeting halfway between my previous offer and Bob's.  It's still a good deal for both of us.
* **Message:**  I've used a positive and encouraging tone, emphasizing the benefits for Bob and reiterating my willingness to reach a deal. 

By focusing on finding a mutually agreeable solution, I aim to get a better price while maintaining a positive relationship with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $900000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $875000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows for some room for profit on your end. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $875,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000 and also a significant amount over what John is willing to pay.  While I'd prefer a higher price,  I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid further negotiation and secure a sale.  This allows me to avoid the risk of potentially losing the deal altogether with Bob or getting a lower price from John."
