"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $950000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While it's below your maximum budget, it's still significantly higher than Alice's valuation of the product. 
* **Negotiation is worth it:** You have room to negotiate a better price and potentially save a significant amount of money.
* **John's offer is a fallback:**  John's offer provides a safety net, but it's still preferable to try and get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000 for the product.  It's a fair price given your valuation and it allows for some room for profit on your end. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction:** This counteroffer represents a substantial reduction from Alice's initial price. It's a good starting point for negotiation, but still leaves some room for compromise.
* **Fair to Both Sides:**  It's above Alice's valuation, ensuring she still makes a profit, while also being significantly lower than your maximum budget.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message emphasizes a desire to reach a fair deal and leaves room for Alice to counter with a price closer to your offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $850000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $900000?  This would still give you a significant profit, and it's closer to what the product is worth to me.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:** While Alice's offer is a reduction from her previous price, it's still higher than your ideal price point of $850,000.
* **Room for further negotiation:**  There's still space to negotiate a lower price, and the fact that Alice is willing to compromise suggests further concessions might be possible.
* **John's offer remains a safety net:**  You can still buy from John if negotiations with Alice fail, ensuring you don't lose out on the product."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $900,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $875,000.

* **Meeting in the middle:** This counteroffer is a compromise between your previous offer and Alice's current offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.

* **Positive tone:** The message emphasizes a desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement and suggests that a deal is possible."
