"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850000 for the product.  It's a fair price given your valuation and it allows for some room for profit on your end. What do you say?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $850000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $900000?  This would still give you a significant profit, and it's closer to what the product is worth to me.  Let's make this happen!",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $900000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $875000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows for some room for profit on your end. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,
