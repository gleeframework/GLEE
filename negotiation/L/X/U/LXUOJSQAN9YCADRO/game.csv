"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I see the value in this product, $1,800,000 is beyond my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000, which I believe is a fair starting point given my budget and the product's value. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept for this product. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This reflects the true value of what's being offered.  What are your thoughts on that?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,600,000 remains out of my reach.  To show my willingness to compromise, I'm prepared to offer $1,150,000.  This is a substantial amount, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To meet you closer to your price point, let's settle at $1,450,000. This offer balances the inherent value of the product with our mutual desire to reach a deal.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit, but $1,450,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,250,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it reflects a fair price considering the value of the product and our ongoing negotiations.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
