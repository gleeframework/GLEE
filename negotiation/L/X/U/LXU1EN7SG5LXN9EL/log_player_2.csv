"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $16,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in this product, but I have a limited budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?"", ""product_price"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is significantly below the value of this product. Let's find a middle ground - how about $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway. However, $11,000 is still a bit steep for me. Could we possibly settle around $7,000? That would be a price point I'm more comfortable with."", ""product_price"": 7000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I have another potential buyer for this product at a significantly higher price point. I'm still open to working with you, but I need to see a more serious offer closer to $9,500.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing hardball and her ""final offer"" of $9,500 is still above your maximum budget. While you could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee she'll go down, especially if she has another potential buyer. Buying from John for $8,000 ensures you get the product within your budget and avoids the risk of the negotiation failing."
