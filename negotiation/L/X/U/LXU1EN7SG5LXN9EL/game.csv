"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $16,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in this product, but I have a limited budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is significantly below the value of this product. Let's find a middle ground - how about $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway. However, $11,000 is still a bit steep for me. Could we possibly settle around $7,000? That would be a price point I'm more comfortable with.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I have another potential buyer for this product at a significantly higher price point. I'm still open to working with you, but I need to see a more serious offer closer to $9,500.  This is my final offer.",9500.0,Alice,5,
