"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to stay within a budget of $15,000. Would you be able to lower the price to meet this requirement? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $15,000 is above my minimum price of $10,000 and it's the maximum price he's willing to pay.  There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in future rounds, and I could risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting his offer is the most profitable and secure option in this situation."
