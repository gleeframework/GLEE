{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This is a strategic starting point:

* **Reasoning:**  A price of $1,200,000 is significantly above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  
* **Goal:** This initial offer allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get him to counter with a higher offer, bringing the price closer to your desired range. 
* **Backup Plan:**  If Bob rejects, you can always fall back on selling to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This would still be a good deal for you, as it's well above your desired value. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While it's above his perceived value, it's significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Bob is clearly interested, and his counteroffer suggests he's willing to negotiate. 
* **John's Offer:**  You have a guaranteed fallback option with John, giving you leverage in the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, you can make a counteroffer that is more favorable to you, aiming to close the gap between your desired price and Bob's offer. This will continue to explore the possibility of a profitable deal with Bob while keeping John as a backup."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. However, $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,025,000? This price still leaves room for you to profit and is closer to my value. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Rationale:**  This counteroffer is a compromise, demonstrating flexibility while still ensuring a profit above your minimum price.
* **Meeting Halfway:** The price of $1,025,000 is the midpoint between Bob's offer ($850,000) and your initial offer ($1,200,000), showing your willingness to negotiate.
* **Profit Potential:**  This price still allows you to earn significantly more than your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, you maintain the pressure on Bob to negotiate while keeping John's offer as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1,025,000 is still a bit steep for me. However, I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This price is a significant improvement from my previous offer and still allows for a good profit margin for you. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below your minimum:** While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  Bob is demonstrating a willingness to negotiate further, suggesting there's room for a deal that benefits both parties.
* **John's Offer:** You still have the guarantee of John's offer, which is significantly higher than what Bob is currently offering.

**Next Steps:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, you can make another counteroffer closer to your desired price, continuing to try to reach an agreement with Bob while also holding onto the security of John's offer."

Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
