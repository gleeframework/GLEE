Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to me.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $900,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm framing the offer as beneficial for both of us, highlighting the value I'm giving up.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message makes it clear I'm open to discussing the price, signaling flexibility.
* **Back-up Plan:**  I'm aware of John's offer, giving me a strong fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the gesture, but I am only able to pay up to $850,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable value ($1,000,000), it's still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  
* **Potential for Better Deal:** I believe there's room for negotiation and I can potentially get a better price.
* **Avoiding Losses:**  Accepting Bob's offer would result in a significant financial loss for me compared to selling to John.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than his offer, aiming to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to compromise. How about we split the difference and go with $875,000?  This would be a good deal for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer ($900,000) and Bob's offer ($850,000).
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone, emphasizing the potential for a ""good deal"" for both parties.
* **Maintaining Flexibility:** I'm still leaving room for further negotiation by asking for Bob's opinion.
* **Avoiding John:** I'm still hopeful of reaching a deal with Bob, as selling to John would mean a significant loss in potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. However, I still believe $850,000 is a fair price for the product. I am unable to increase my offer beyond that. I hope you can meet me halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:**  Bob has made it clear he won't budge on his $850,000 offer.  
* **Financial Risk:**  Accepting his offer would result in a significant financial loss compared to selling to John.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks wasting time and potentially losing out on a guaranteed deal with John.

**Conclusion:**

While I would prefer to get closer to my desired price, selling to John is the most financially sound decision at this point. It ensures a guaranteed profit and avoids further negotiation with Bob, which may not lead to a better outcome."
