Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $140. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to $150 as possible, but we also want to avoid Bob rejecting the offer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While $140 is a starting point, offering slightly below your ""walk-away"" price leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate up, getting you closer to your goal.
* **John as a Guarantee:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale with John at $150 provides a safety net. You can afford to be a bit more ambitious with your initial offer to Bob."
