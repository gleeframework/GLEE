"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's valuation, but I'm hoping he'll see the value in the product and be willing to negotiate. It's important to start high to leave room for negotiation, but not so high that he immediately rejects the offer.  I'm also being friendly and optimistic to build a positive rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to settle for a price that doesn't reflect the value of the product.  I'll counter with a price closer to my desired value, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $95?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $85. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm running out of rounds, selling to Bob for $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'll counter again, hoping to find a middle ground and close the deal before I have to resort to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $85 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $90 to close this deal.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $90 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $87.50? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where I'm running out of time and Bob's offers are still below my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to close the deal with Bob, it's more important to ensure I get at least $100 for the product. Therefore, I'm choosing to sell to John for $100."
