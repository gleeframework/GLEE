Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999. Any price within this range can be mutually beneficial.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high within the ZOPA, but provide some justification to make Bob feel like he's getting a reasonable deal.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential for [mention a key benefit relevant to Bob], I'm initially valuing it at $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair price for such a high-return asset. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You start by highlighting exclusivity and value.
* **Justification:** You provide a reason for the high price without revealing your absolute bottom line.
* **High Anchor:** $1,450,000 sets a strong anchor within the ZOPA, leaving room for negotiation if needed.
* **Open to Discussion:**  The tone invites Bob to counter-offer, keeping the negotiation open.

**Important Note:** This is just the first move. Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response."
