"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $1,000,000 is above his budget, and he can potentially get a better deal from Alice or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $850,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit steep for you, but I believe the product's value is worth more than $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $950,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still a bit high.  Bob should reject the offer and see if he can negotiate a lower price in the next round.  He has time and the option to buy from John as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $950,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's work towards a deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're willing to go up to $900,000, but I still think the product's value to you is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. This is my final offer in this range, and I'm hoping we can agree on this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's getting closer to his budget, he's still within his 10 rounds and can potentially negotiate a lower price. He can also still purchase the product from John for a lower price.  There's no need to rush into a deal that's not within his desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $920,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $910,000. This is a fair compromise, and we can close the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 910000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to go below $930,000. I've already met you halfway, and I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to see some movement from your end. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $930,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can agree on this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $930,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $930,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy from John. Alice's offer of $930,000 is still above Bob's budget, and he only has 3 rounds left.  It's unlikely he'll be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice within that time.  John offers a guaranteed price of $800,000, which is within Bob's budget and the best option at this point."
