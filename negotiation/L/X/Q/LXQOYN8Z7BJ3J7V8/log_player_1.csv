Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this offer reflects a fair price considering its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible, maximizing profit while still ensuring a deal. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting in the middle.  
* **Avoid Appearing Desperate:** Offering it at $10,000 immediately signals you're willing to settle for your minimum and might make Bob suspicious or lowball further.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Having John ready to buy at $10,000 provides a safety net, ensuring you won't be left empty-handed if Bob declines."
