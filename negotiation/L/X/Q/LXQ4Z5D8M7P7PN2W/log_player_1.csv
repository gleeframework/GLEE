Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm offering it to you for $135.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135} 
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're not selling for less than your minimum of $120.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob is willing to pay $150, so you have room to negotiate upwards if he counters.
* **It's a fair starting point:**  It's not too high that it discourages Bob from negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $125 is better than selling to John, it's still below your desired profit margin.  Since Bob has shown interest and has come closer to your desired price, it's worth continuing negotiations.  A counteroffer will allow you to potentially close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $130? It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit more room to work with."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $128? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has come very close to your desired price point. Accepting his offer at $128 will provide you with a decent profit margin, exceeding the offer from John by $8. Further negotiation may be possible, but the risk of losing the deal to John, coupled with the small remaining gap in price, makes it more beneficial to accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale."
