"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. After considering your interest, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this product.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,200,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise considering its value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something around $700,000. Would that be feasible?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $850,000. This is my final compromise, and I hope you can meet me at this price.",850000.0,Alice,5,
