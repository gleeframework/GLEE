"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $12,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get closer to my desired $15,000.  I'm also aware that I have the option to sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not desperate to close a deal with Bob at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is tempting, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my ideal price. I'll reject his offer and try to counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from my initial offer, but I'm still holding firm on a price that's higher than Bob's current offer.  I believe there's still room for negotiation and I'm confident I can close a deal that's closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now very close to my target price of $15,000.  Given that we are in round 4 and I have a fallback option to sell to John for $15,000, I'm comfortable accepting Bob's offer of $14,500. This ensures a good profit for me and secures the sale."
