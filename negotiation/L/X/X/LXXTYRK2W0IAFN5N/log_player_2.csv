"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price?"",
 ""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Start Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from anchoring. Starting with a low offer ($90) leaves room to negotiate upwards while staying well below our $120 limit.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is friendly but clearly indicates that the initial offer is unacceptable.
* **Strategic Ambiguity:** We don't explicitly state our upper limit, leaving room for Alice to potentially counter with a price closer to our target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand you're looking for a better price, but I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** $140 is closer to our budget but still significantly above what John is offering. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice seems willing to negotiate, moving almost halfway from her initial offer. This suggests there's space to bring the price down further.
* **Alternative Option:**  We have the security of John's offer ($120), giving us leverage to be patient and aim for a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $140 is getting closer, but I'm on a tight budget. Could you do $110?"",
 ""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up, But Strategically:**  We're increasing our offer to show Alice we're serious, but still staying below our $120 absolute limit.
* **Testing the Waters:**  $110 is a significant jump from $90. This will help gauge how much further Alice is willing to come down. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  We're getting closer to John's price, so we don't want to concede too much too quickly. A strong counter-offer keeps the pressure on Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're still in negotiations! I'm willing to meet you at $125, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, But Not Quite:** Alice is now very close to John's price, but we're still aiming to maximize our savings. 
* **Time Advantage:** We still have several rounds left, so we can afford to be a little more patient and see if Alice will come down those last few dollars.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:**  Alice knows we have another option, which gives us some negotiating power."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, you're really close! I'm willing to go up to $115, but that's really the best I can do. It's a great product, but I have to stick to my budget."",
 ""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  We're meeting Alice halfway between her last offer ($125) and our previous counter ($110), showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Final Offer Tactic (Almost):** By stating this is ""the best I can do,"" we're creating a sense of urgency and suggesting this is our final offer (even if we might budge a tiny bit).
* **Below John's Price:** We're still aiming to get a better deal than John's offer, maximizing our savings. 
* **Leaving Room for Alice:** There's a small chance Alice might counter at $120, which we'd accept to avoid losing the deal altogether."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm willing to meet you at $118, but I'm getting close to my minimum price. Can you consider that? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $118
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal Secured:** Alice has come down to $118, which is only $2 more than John's offer. This is a very good price and achieves significant savings compared to her initial offers.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Trying to push for those last $2 risks Alice walking away from the deal entirely. We might end up with John's offer anyway, but we've already secured a great discount. 
* **Limited Rounds:**  We have three rounds left, but the potential gain is small compared to the risk of Alice raising her price again or the negotiation stalling."
