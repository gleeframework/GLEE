"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than you'd like to pay, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $11,500 for the product. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",11500.0,Alice,3,
