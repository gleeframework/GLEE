"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $12,000 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000? I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still a little too high for me. How about we settle on $10,200? This would be a good deal for both of us.",10200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,200. I'm willing to make a slight concession and offer the product to you for $10,400. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal. What do you think?",10400.0,Alice,5,
