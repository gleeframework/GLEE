Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential benefits you'll reap. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you want to start negotiations with Bob at a higher price. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring you don't settle for less than your guaranteed amount.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 positions it as a premium offering, emphasizing its value. 
* **Open for Negotiation:** The message explicitly invites Bob to share his thoughts, indicating a willingness to negotiate. This approach can lead to a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Why not ask for more?**

While you could start even higher, it's important to be realistic.  Bob knows the product is worth $800,000 to him. An extremely high offer might discourage him from negotiating altogether. Aiming for a price slightly below your guaranteed amount increases the chances of closing the deal with Bob."
