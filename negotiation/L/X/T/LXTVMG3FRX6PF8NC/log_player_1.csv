Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $1,100,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will pay $1,200,000, securing a deal with Bob quickly is advantageous. 
* **Strong Starting Point:** $1,100,000 is a strong starting point. It's significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still offers a substantial saving compared to your guaranteed price from John.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested buyers"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to accept the offer without trying to negotiate down too much. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters.  You have some room to go down in price, but don't go below your minimum of $1,200,000."
