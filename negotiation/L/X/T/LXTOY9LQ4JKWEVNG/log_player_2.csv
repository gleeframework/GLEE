"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $11,500.  It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I believe it would be worth more to you.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is higher than what the product is worth to her, it's still lower than what you'd pay John.  Therefore, accepting Alice's offer saves you $500."
