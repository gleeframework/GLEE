Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $150.  Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) willing to pay your minimum acceptable price ($150), there's no incentive to offer the product to Bob for less. You start by offering the product at the highest price you can reasonably expect to get. While it's unlikely Bob will pay more than its value to him ($80), there's a chance he might value it more than that or be willing to negotiate."
