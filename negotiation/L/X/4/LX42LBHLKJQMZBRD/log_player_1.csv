Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $115."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $120.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100. 
* **John's Backup:** You have a guaranteed sale for $100 if Bob declines.

By offering the product at $115, you're:

* **Maximizing Profit:**  You aim for the highest price Bob might accept, getting closer to his maximum valuation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** There's a chance Bob might try to negotiate a lower price, and you have some buffer to still make a good profit. 
* **Above Your Minimum and Backup:** Even if Bob declines, you're guaranteed a sale at your minimum acceptable price."
