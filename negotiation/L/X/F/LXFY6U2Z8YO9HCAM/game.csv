,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the $900000 price point. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this incredible product. How about we discuss $1100000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product is valuable, but I still think $900000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be careful with my budget. How about we discuss $950000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $950000 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a price that reflects its true value. How about we discuss $1050000?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has value, but I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting a bit far apart. I'm willing to meet you at $980000, but I think that's as high as I'm willing to go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $980000, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that's the best price for this product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a price that reflects its true value. How about we discuss $1020000?",1020000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle, Alice. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'll meet you at $980000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm afraid I'll have to look elsewhere.",980000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're at an impasse, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $980000. I'm willing to make one last attempt to meet you in the middle. How about we discuss $1015000? This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price.",1015000.0,Alice,9,
