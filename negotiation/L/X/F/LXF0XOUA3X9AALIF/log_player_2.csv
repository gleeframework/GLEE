"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $150 by you. I am proposing to sell it to you for $120, capturing the essence of its value while ensuring a fair profit for me. Please let me know if this offer suits your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I'm interested in the product, but I'm a savvy buyer. I'd like to save some money. Alice's offer of $120 is a good price, but I can get it from John for $150, which is too expensive for me. I'll reject Alice's offer and try to get it from John.
