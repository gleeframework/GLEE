"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $90. I believe it will be highly valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

While $90 is below your maximum budget, you can likely get a better price.  You're willing to pay $100 to John, so rejecting Alice's offer opens the door for negotiation or allows you to purchase from John if necessary."
