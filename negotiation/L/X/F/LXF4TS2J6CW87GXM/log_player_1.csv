Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I believe it offers significant value at this price."", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $120 for it. Would you consider accepting this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob's offer of $120 is the highest he's willing to pay, and it's not worth going below my minimum of $120. John offers a guaranteed $120, so it makes the most sense to sell to him."
