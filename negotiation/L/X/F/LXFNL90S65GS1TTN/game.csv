"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure I can go any higher.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90? It's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to my desired price.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I really think $80 is the maximum I can pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we go with $85? That's the highest I can go.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're set on $85, but that's still a bit below what I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to come down to $90 one last time.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it avoids us having to go through more rounds of negotiation. What do you say?",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth, but I'm still interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you at $87.50. That's the highest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",87.5,Bob,6,
