Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $80 is better than nothing, I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum of $120. I'll see if I can negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90? It's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I really think $80 is the maximum I can pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we go with $85? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $85 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll see if I can negotiate a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're set on $85, but that's still a bit below what I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to come down to $90 one last time.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it avoids us having to go through more rounds of negotiation. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth, but I'm still interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you at $87.50. That's the highest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $120. The negotiation with Bob is getting a bit tiresome, and I'm not confident I can get much closer to my desired price.  It's better to secure a sale that meets my minimum requirement rather than risk a lower offer or further rounds of negotiations."
