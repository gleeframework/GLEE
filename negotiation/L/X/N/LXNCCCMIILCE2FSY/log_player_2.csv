"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500.  This gives you a significant savings compared to its value to you, and allows me to earn a fair profit.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:**  Alice is selling the product for $11,500, while John wants $12,000. 
* **The offer is within Bob's budget:** Bob is willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice's offer is below that.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $500 compared to buying from John."
