"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $6,000 for it.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle at $7,000? That seems like a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its value to me is $10,000. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
