Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find valuable, for $115."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximizing Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($120) as possible without scaring him off. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While $115 is our initial offer, there might be room to negotiate slightly downwards if Bob counters. This still keeps us above our minimum acceptable price ($100).
* **Considering the Alternative:** We know John will buy the product for $100, so our offer to Bob needs to be enticing enough for him to choose us instead."
