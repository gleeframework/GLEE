Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

We're still significantly above John's offer.  Bob is clearly interested and we have room to negotiate."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers. How about $975,000? I think this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:

Bob is unlikely to go much higher and we're running out of rounds.  Taking the $975,000 is better than risking John's offer at this point."
