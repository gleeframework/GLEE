"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be a perfect fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $100.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You can get the product from John for $80, so it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. How about $85?  I'm really interested in the product, so let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95.  This still leaves a fair margin for both of us.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $95 is closer to your target, it's still higher than what you can get from John. Let's see if you can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $95 is still a little high for my budget.  How about $90?  That would be a fair deal for both of us and would allow me to finalize the purchase.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you on the budget. $90 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more to make this work for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $92.50. That way we both get a fair deal.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

While $92.50 is closer to your target than what Alice previously offered, it is still more expensive than what you can get from John. It's better to buy the product from John at $80 and save some money."
