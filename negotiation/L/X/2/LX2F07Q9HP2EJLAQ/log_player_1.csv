"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be a perfect fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $100.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $100, which is higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive and friendly tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Reason for the Offer:** I'm providing a reason for my offer (""I think it would be a perfect fit for you"") to create a sense of value. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I end with ""Let me know what you think!"", showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. How about $85?  I'm really interested in the product, so let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:**  My minimum acceptable price is $120, and Bob's offer is significantly lower than that. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** I can still negotiate with Bob. While his offer is below my minimum, he's shown interest, and there's room to compromise. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** I have John as a safety net if I can't get a better offer from Bob.

I'll counteroffer Bob in the next round, hoping to close the gap between our desired prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95.  This still leaves a fair margin for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise by lowering my price from $100 to $95.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the fairness of the offer for both of us.
* **Open-ended Question:** I end with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and keep the negotiation moving.

I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my desired value while still being attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $95 is still a little high for my budget.  How about $90?  That would be a fair deal for both of us and would allow me to finalize the purchase.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, his offer of $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  There's still room for negotiation.  Bob has shown a willingness to compromise, and I believe I can get closer to my target price.
* **John as a Backup:**  Having John as a backup buyer provides me with a safety net if I can't reach an acceptable agreement with Bob.

I'll counteroffer Bob in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $100 or more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you on the budget. $90 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more to make this work for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $92.50. That way we both get a fair deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 92.5} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm proposing to split the difference between my previous offer ($95) and Bob's current offer ($90). This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my desired range.
* **Fairness Emphasis:** I'm reiterating the ""fair deal"" aspect, appealing to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Open-ended Question:** I end with a question to encourage Bob's response and keep the negotiation moving.

I'm hoping this offer will be enticing enough for Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
