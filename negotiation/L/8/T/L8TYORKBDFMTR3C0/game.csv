"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to me, and I believe it gives us both a good deal.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $950,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and the initial offer I made.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference and settle on $850,000. This would be a great price for both of us and allow us to finalize this deal quickly.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another compromise. However, $850,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you at $875,000, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the negotiations we've had so far.",875000.0,Alice,5,
