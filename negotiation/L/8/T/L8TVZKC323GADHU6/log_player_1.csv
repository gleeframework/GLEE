"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 900000} 

I'm starting with a bold offer, aiming for a higher price than the product's worth to Bob.  This sets a strong starting point for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation. I want to see if I can push him closer to my original asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

I'm counter-offering with $850,000. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still confident in the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price. I'm happy to accept and close the deal. There's no need to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the sale."
