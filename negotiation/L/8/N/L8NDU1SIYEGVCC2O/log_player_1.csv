Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **My minimum acceptable price:** I value the product at $15,000, but I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Bob's perceived value:** Bob values the product at $12,000.
* **My offer:**  I'm starting with $14,500. This is a midpoint between our perceived values, leaving room for negotiation.  
* **Why I chose this price:** This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:
    * It shows I'm willing to negotiate.
    * It's a significant discount from my minimum, making it more likely Bob will accept.
    * It gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob makes a counteroffer.

**Next steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll consider his counteroffer. If it's significantly lower than $14,500, I'll likely make a counteroffer. If his offer is too low, I'll likely choose to sell to John at $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's counteroffer:**  Bob offered $13,500, which is closer to his perceived value than mine. 
* **My goal:**  My goal is to earn as much as possible. While $13,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.
* **My strategy:** I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. I believe I can still get a better price.

**Next steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than his offer, aiming to bridge the gap between our valuations. If Bob continues to offer low prices, I'll likely sell to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **My previous offer:** My initial offer of $14,500 was rejected by Bob.
* **Bob's counteroffer:** Bob countered with $13,500, which is significantly lower than my minimum.
* **My counteroffer:**  I'm offering $14,000. This is a compromise between our previous offers,  and still a bit higher than Bob's offer. 

**Why I chose this price:**

* **Negotiation:** I want to show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not willing to go too low. 
* **Bridging the gap:**  $14,000 is closer to my minimum, and it might be more appealing to Bob than my previous offer. 

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts this offer, I'll sell him the product for $14,000.
* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to carefully consider his next counteroffer. If it's too low, I'll likely sell to John for $15,000."

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's counteroffer:** Bob offered $13,000, which is only slightly higher than his previous offer. 
* **My goal:** My goal is to maximize my profit, and  $13,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.

**Next steps:**

I'll accept John's offer and sell the product to him for $15,000."
