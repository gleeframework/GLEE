I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer. I'm aiming to gauge his interest and see how high he's willing to go.  I'll adjust my strategy based on his response."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get more. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

I'm lowering the price a bit, but still leaving room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Bob has moved up to $1,100,000, which is a significant increase from his initial offer.  While I'd love to get more, it's getting closer to my desired range and there's a risk of him backing out completely. I'll accept his offer and secure the sale."
