Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm willing to make this offer to ensure a smooth and quick transaction. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to $15,000 as possible, but we also want to avoid Bob rejecting the offer. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product for $14,000 creates a strong incentive for Bob. He gains $2,000 in value ($14,000 offer vs. his $12,000 valuation). 
* **Time Value:** While John offers a guaranteed $15,000, selling to Bob quickly might be more desirable than waiting for John's purchase.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring Bob accepts the offer."
