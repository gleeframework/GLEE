Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but still lower than my minimum acceptable price ($12,000). 
* **Room for Negotiation:** This leaves room for negotiation, allowing Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal while still giving me a profit.
* **Positive Framing:** My message is positive and emphasizes the value Bob would get from the product. 
* **Plan B:**  I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John for $12,000 if Bob doesn't agree to a price I find acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within $8000. Would you be willing to adjust your offer accordingly? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price.**  I'm not willing to sell for less than $12,000. 
* **There's still room for negotiation.** While Bob's offer is low, he's shown interest and is willing to negotiate.  
* **Selling to John is my fallback option.** I have a guaranteed sale with John, but I'm still hoping to get a better price from Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired price point, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, I'm unable to go that low at this time.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This still gives you a good value, and it allows me to meet my own needs. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Towards a Compromise:** I'm counteroffering with a price closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. This shows a willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground.
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize the value Bob would still get at this price.
* **Maintaining Flexibility:** I'm not going too low yet, leaving space for potential further negotiation if needed. 
* **Positive and  Open Tone:** My message is positive and open to further discussion, showing that I'm still willing to work with Bob to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for considering my budget constraints. I would like to propose an offer of $9000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations while staying within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Risk of losing out:** If I reject this offer, there's a chance Bob will walk away, and I'll be left with my fallback option of selling to John for $12,000. 
* **Time and effort:** Further negotiation might take more time and effort, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better price.

**Overall:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a profit, even if it's not my ideal outcome.  It's a pragmatic decision that balances my financial needs with the risk of losing the sale altogether."
