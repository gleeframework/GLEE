Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment. I'm asking for $1,400,000.  Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since we have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, we aim to get as close to that as possible from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,400,000 gives Bob the impression of a potential deal and leaves room for negotiation if he tries to lower the price. 
* **High Initial Offer:**  A high initial offer anchors the negotiation, making it more likely Bob will counter with a price closer to our desired range. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still keeping the offer attractive enough for him to accept."
