"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8500. I'm willing to pay that much, but I think it's a bit high for me. Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8500 is unfortunately below my minimum price point.  How about we meet in the middle at $9250? I believe this price reflects the value of the product while still being a fair deal for both of us.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $9250. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8800. I think this is a more reasonable price for me, considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob,  I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $8800 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down slightly to $9000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and our ongoing negotiations.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9000. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay that much. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8500. I think this is the best price I can offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price. Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",8500.0,Bob,6,
