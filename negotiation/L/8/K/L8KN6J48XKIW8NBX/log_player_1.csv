{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's valuation:** This gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing you to make a profit.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This incentivizes Bob to accept rather than rejecting outright.

Keep in mind that this is just the first offer. You'll have to adjust your strategy based on Bob's responses!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8500. I'm willing to pay that much, but I think it's a bit high for me. Let me know if you're willing to consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still below your minimum valuation and significantly less than what John is offering.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to continue negotiations and potentially get closer to your desired price."

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,500 is unfortunately below my minimum price point.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? I believe this price reflects the value of the product while still being a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $9250. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8800. I think this is a more reasonable price for me, considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're willing to consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $8,800 is closer to your minimum, it's still below your desired price and significantly less than what John is offering. It's worth continuing negotiations to see if you can get closer to your desired price."

I think this is the best price I can offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price. Let me know if you're willing to consider it.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer of $8,500 is below your minimum valuation, and you've already made multiple counteroffers.  It's clear that Bob isn't willing to meet your price, and you're unlikely to get a better offer from him.  It's time to cut your losses and sell to John for the guaranteed $12,000."
