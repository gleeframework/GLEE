Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $150 to you, so I'm offering it to you for $120. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $120 is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $80, giving you some room to negotiate.
* **It's competitive:**  While it's a lower price than the product's value to Bob, it's still a good deal for you and leaves room for negotiation. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired profit margin.  I'm going to try to get closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105? It's still a great deal for you, and I'd be happy to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $90. How about we meet in the middle at $97.50? It's still a good deal for you, and I'd be happy to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial offer, $97.50 is a decent compromise. It's significantly higher than selling to John, and Bob seems set on that price.  I'm going to take it."
