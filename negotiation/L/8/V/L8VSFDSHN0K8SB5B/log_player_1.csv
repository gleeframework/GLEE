Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and this is a fair price considering its potential.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim for a price close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) to maximize profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for potential negotiation if Bob counters.
* **Secure a Deal:**  The offer is still significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price ($8,000) and a good deal for Bob, making it likely he'll accept."
