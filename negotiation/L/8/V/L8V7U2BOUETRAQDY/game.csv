"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $140 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $130. This is a compromise I'm willing to make to get the deal done. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $130 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my original offer of $100. If that doesn't work for you, I'll have to look elsewhere.",100.0,Bob,4,
