"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $90 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend. I'd be willing to pay $75 for the product.  What do you think?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $75 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of selling the product for $82. It's a fair price considering its value, and I think you'll really enjoy it. What do you think?",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $82 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $80?  That would be a good deal for both of us.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $80 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make another concession and sell it to you for $81. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. What do you think?",81.0,Alice,5,
