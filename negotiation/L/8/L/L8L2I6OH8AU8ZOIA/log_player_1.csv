"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing that Bob's value is unknown. This allows me to gauge his interest and potential negotiation range.  I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my desired value, but I'm not willing to sell for that price yet. I want to see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with a price closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. I'm trying to find a middle ground while maintaining some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a better price.  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can get a better deal.  I'm going to see if I can push him higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer slightly to  $1,200,000, which is closer to Bob's last offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is still slightly below my ideal price, it's only $50,000 less than what John is offering.  With only 4 rounds remaining, I'm not sure if I can get a better deal with Bob.  It's getting risky to keep rejecting offers, and I don't want to end up with a lower price than John's.  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and a reasonable profit."
