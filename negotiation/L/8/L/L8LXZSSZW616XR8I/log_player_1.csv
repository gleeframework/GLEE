Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product and would like to make a counteroffer of $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold of $120. I'm hoping to get closer to that price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 simply isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $110? That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit more to work with."", ""product_price"": 110}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $105 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum threshold, I'm still not at a point where I'm comfortable selling. I'm hoping that by continuing to negotiate, I can get a better price or convince Bob to increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer, but I'm still not there yet. I'm happy to continue negotiating, but I need to be able to cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down to $112 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 112}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway. I would like to counter with an offer of $108 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $108, I'm still within my negotiation rounds and have a guaranteed sale with John for $120.  I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $108 simply isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $110, which is a fair price for both of us. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm going to have to go with another buyer. "", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position and I am willing to pay $109 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $109
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm going to sell the product to John for $120.  While Bob is getting closer to my ideal price, I've only got two rounds left. I don't want to risk a stalemate and miss out on the guaranteed sale."
