"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $11,000 for it. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $11,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  That's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let me know your thoughts.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $16,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit too high. Could you do $12,500?  That would be a fair compromise, I think.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $14,000?  It's a significant drop from my previous offer, and I'm confident it's a price we can both be happy with.  Let's close this deal.",14000.0,Alice,5,
