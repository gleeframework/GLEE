I'm starting with a price of $1,800,000. This gives me a good starting point for negotiation, and leaves room for potential concessions if necessary. 

It's important to note that I am aware of John's offer of $1,500,000, so I am not willing to go lower than that.  My goal is to maximize my profit, but also to be flexible enough to potentially reach a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I would be happy to sell to him at a higher price, I am not willing to go below my minimum threshold of $1,500,000. I will counter his offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm countering with $1,600,000. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will be a more attractive offer to Bob, while still leaving some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, Bob's offer is still below my minimum. Given the risk of further negotiations leading to a lower price, I'm going to accept John's offer of $1,500,000. This ensures I reach my minimum threshold and avoids the potential of getting stuck in a lengthy negotiation with Bob that may not lead to a profitable outcome."
