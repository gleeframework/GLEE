Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with an ambitious price of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers, while still ensuring I make a profit beyond my minimum value of $1,200,000.  I'm confident I can get a good price, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob isn't willing to meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to get a higher price, I'm not willing to settle for such a low amount. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is still above my minimum acceptable price, but it shows I'm willing to be flexible and negotiate. I'm hoping this will be a more appealing price to Bob, but I'm also prepared to go back and forth a few more times if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob has come up slightly, his offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potentially lose more time and money. Selling to John for $1,200,000 guarantees me a reasonable profit and avoids the uncertainty of further haggling with Bob."
