"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $800,000 to me, and I believe it could be even more valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000. This is a price I'm confident is fair, considering its potential. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high offer ($1,000,000) to leave room for negotiation and maximize potential profit. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm emphasizing the product's value and potential for Bob, creating a sense of urgency and making him consider the potential return on investment. 
* **Fair Price:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""fair price"" to make it more palatable to Bob. 
* **Open Communication:** I'm encouraging Bob to respond and engage in a conversation to understand his perspective. 

This strategy aims to get the negotiation moving while leaving room for adjustments based on Bob's reaction in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value you place on this product, but I am looking for a more reasonable price. Considering my budget and the potential use of the product, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $750000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for less than what John is offering just yet. I still have 8 rounds left to negotiate with Bob, and there's potential to get a higher price. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Maintain leverage:**  Demonstrating that I'm not desperate to sell at a lower price.
* **Explore better options:** See if Bob is willing to increase his offer in the next round.
* **Use John's offer as a reference point:** Remind Bob that I have an alternative buyer willing to pay more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your budget constraints, $750,000 is simply too low for me to accept. I'm confident this product's potential value for you justifies a higher price.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to lower my offer to $900,000. This reflects both the product's worth and your expressed budget concerns.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge and Address Concerns:** I start by acknowledging Bob's budget constraints to show I'm listening and willing to compromise. 
* **Emphasize Product Value:** I reiterate the product's potential value to Bob, making it clear that a lower price undervalues it.
* **Meet in the Middle:**  I propose a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a profitable deal.
* **Open Invitation:** I end with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to engage further and potentially accept my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. I still feel that the product's price should be more aligned with my budget. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $850,000 is just $50,000 above John's offer.  Considering the following:

* **Time is Money:** We're already in round 4, and I have a limited number of rounds to negotiate. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  While I could try to get a higher price, it's risky. Bob might not be willing to go higher, and I could end up with John's offer, which is only slightly less.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a profit significantly higher than John's offer, and I can always use this experience to negotiate better in the future.

Therefore, it's in my best interest to accept Bob's offer and secure a good deal."
