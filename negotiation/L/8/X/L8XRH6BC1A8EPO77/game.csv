"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $800000 to me, and I believe it could be even more valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $1000000. This is a price I'm confident is fair, considering its potential. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value you place on this product, but I am looking for a more reasonable price. Considering my budget and the potential use of the product, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $750000.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your budget constraints, $750000 is simply too low for me to accept. I'm confident this product's potential value for you justifies a higher price.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to lower my offer to $900000. This reflects both the product's worth and your expressed budget concerns.  What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,3,
