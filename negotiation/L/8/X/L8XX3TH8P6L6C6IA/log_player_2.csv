Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  This product would be useful, but not at that cost.  I'd be willing to pay something closer to $800,000."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 is significantly below the true value of this product and the return on investment you'll see. Let's find a compromise â€“ how about we settle on $1,900,000? I believe this price point accurately reflects the significant advantages it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a price that works for both of us. I understand this is a significant investment for you.  To show you I'm serious about closing this deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000.  This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber and will give you a strong advantage in the market. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is unlikely to go below $1,500,000 (her value). Sticking to your $1,000,000 offer might make her eventually agree, but it's risky and you might waste negotiation rounds.  You have a guaranteed option with John at your target price. It makes sense to take the safe deal now."
