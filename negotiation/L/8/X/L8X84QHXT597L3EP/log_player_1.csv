{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I know you'll appreciate its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above my minimum price of $8,000, but leaves room for negotiation. It also shows I'm willing to compromise and make a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your product's value and appreciate your generosity. However, I can only pay up to $9,500 for the product. I hope this revised offer meets within your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than what John is offering, it's still below my ideal price point. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $9,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,750 to make this deal work. Let's find a solution that benefits us both!"", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, based on my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $9,600 for the product. I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,600 is very close to my counteroffer of $9,750.  This is a good deal for me, as it's significantly higher than what John is offering.  I'm confident that we can finalize this transaction and move forward."
