"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's split the difference and try $10,750.  This would be a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,
