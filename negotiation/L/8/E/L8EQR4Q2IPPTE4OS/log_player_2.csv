Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but $8,000 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product can bring to you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to negotiate, Bob. However, $9,500 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer at $14,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $14,000. It's not worth risking a higher counteroffer when you have a guaranteed price of $10,000 with John."
