"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but $8,000 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product can bring to you.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for countering, Alice.  While $12,000 is closer, it's still a little steep for me.  How about $9,500? ",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to negotiate, Bob. However, $9,500 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer at $14,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value.",14000.0,Alice,5,
