Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:**  You want to maximize your profit, and $1,450,000 is a good distance from your minimum.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so he has room to negotiate without feeling like he's getting a bad deal. 
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** This price allows for negotiation and potential compromise without jeopardizing your desired profit margin.

This strategy gives you the best chance of getting a good price while still maintaining the possibility of selling to John if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,300,000 is above my minimum, it's still far below what I believe the product is worth. It's better to reject Bob's offer and try for a higher price through a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm lowering my initial offer by $50,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. This counteroffer is still significantly above Bob's offer, but closer to his likely acceptable price range. 

By meeting him halfway, I aim to:

* **Show flexibility:** This shows Bob I'm open to compromise.
* **Encourage further negotiations:**  A smaller gap between our offers increases the likelihood of a successful agreement.
* **Maintain a good profit margin:**  This price still yields a substantial profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, it's getting increasingly likely that Bob won't budge further, and I'm running the risk of losing him entirely.  $1,350,000 is still a good profit for me, and accepting the offer minimizes the risk of a failed negotiation."
