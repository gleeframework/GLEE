"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it could be extremely valuable to your business.  My initial price is $1,200,000, but I'm open to negotiating a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($1,000,000) and a little higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and optimistic tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer and potentially build rapport. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's potential value to Bob's business to make the offer more appealing.
* **Openness:**  I'm making it clear that I'm open to negotiation, which signals flexibility and willingness to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$900,000 is still below my minimum:** While it's closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below my desired profit. 
* **Opportunity to negotiate:** I'm confident I can push for a higher price in the next round. 
* **Sell to John as a backup:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 is always an option, but I'm not at that point yet.  I'll try to squeeze out a little more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective.  $900,000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  However, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000 to show you my commitment to making this deal happen. This price still allows me to make a fair profit, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offering:** I'm demonstrating flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Slightly Higher:** My counteroffer is still higher than Bob's offer, but lower than my initial offer.  
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I emphasize that this price allows both of us to make a fair profit, highlighting the win-win aspect of the deal.
* **Openness:** I reiterate my willingness to reach a solution that benefits both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm eager to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$975,000 is still below my minimum:**  While Bob is coming closer to my minimum, it's still below the $1,000,000 I'm willing to accept. 
* **Opportunity to negotiate:** I'm confident I can push for a slightly higher price in the next round. 
* **Sell to John as a backup:**  Selling to John is always a backup option, but I'll try to close the deal with Bob if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I truly appreciate your continued interest in this product.  While $975,000 is closer, it's still a little below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it offers a good value for both of us.  Let's work together to find a solution that allows us to both succeed."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offering Again:** I'm demonstrating flexibility and continued willingness to negotiate.
* **Slightly Higher:** My counteroffer is still higher than Bob's offer, but closer to his price point.
* **Emphasize Compromise:** I emphasize that my offer is a significant compromise, showing that I'm being reasonable. 
* **Focus on Success:** I emphasize the potential for both of us to succeed with this deal.

**Strategy:**

At this point, I'm trying to find a compromise that is acceptable to both of us. I'm willing to come down a bit more from my initial price but am still trying to get as close to my minimum as possible. Selling to John is always a backup option, but I'm aiming for a successful deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concerns, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make another concession and offer $975,000 again. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm eager to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob is not willing to move beyond $975,000, and I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,000,000.  
* **Risk of Lower Counteroffers:**  If I reject Bob's offer and counter-offer again, there's a risk that he'll come back with an even lower offer.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price of $1,000,000.

**Conclusion:**  With only a few rounds remaining, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation.  Selling to John ensures a secure profit."
