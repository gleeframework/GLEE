"Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a fair price considering its value to you. Let's find some common ground and close this deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm still finding it hard to justify $850,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",775000.0,Bob,4,
