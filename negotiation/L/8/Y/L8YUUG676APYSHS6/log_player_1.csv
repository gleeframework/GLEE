Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

Explanation:

Bob is consistently pushing the price down, and it's unlikely he'll go above $11,000. Accepting his offer means a $1,000 loss compared to John's offer. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation, as Bob may continue to lowball.  Selling to John ensures a guaranteed profit and avoids wasting further time and effort on an uncertain negotiation."
