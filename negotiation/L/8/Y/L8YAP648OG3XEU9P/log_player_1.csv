Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $95. This price is a good starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I'll be ready to counter-offer, but I'll also keep John in mind as a backup buyer if negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still do better. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to counter with $90.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above Bob's offer and allows some wiggle room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would have liked to get closer to my initial price, Bob's offer of $87 is close enough to my minimum acceptable price of $80 and a better deal than selling to John. I'm going to accept his offer."
