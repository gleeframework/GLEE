"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is better than $1,000,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is $50,000 less than Alice's initial offer. This is a reasonable starting point, acknowledging Alice's need to make a profit but also demonstrating Bob's desire for a lower price. It's also important to leave room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's ideal price.  There's still potential to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting allows Bob to continue pushing for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 860000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is raising his offer slightly from the previous round, but still keeping it below Alice's current price.  This shows that Bob is willing to compromise, but is also trying to secure a price closer to his target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $870,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $870,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price again, and now it's only $10,000 above Bob's previous offer. This is a very good deal for Bob, as it's significantly lower than buying from John.  At this point, it's likely that further negotiation would only yield a very small price reduction, and the risk of losing the deal entirely is higher. Therefore, accepting the offer is the most logical choice."
