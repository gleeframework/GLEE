I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $95 is closer to my minimum, I think I can get closer to my target price of $100.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $97 and avoid further negotiation, I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price of $100. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
