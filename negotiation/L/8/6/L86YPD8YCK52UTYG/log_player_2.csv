Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $70 is too low, I could meet you halfway at $82.50. It's a great deal for a product you'll value at $100! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're finding common ground.  $75 is a bit too low for me still, but I'm willing to let it go for $80.  That's the lowest I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80

This is the best option. Alice has reached her lowest price (her product valuation). Continuing negotiations is unlikely to yield a better outcome."
