"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We want to leave room to negotiate upwards while staying well below our $120 maximum.
* **Polite and Reasonable:**  Being overly aggressive can make Alice less willing to negotiate. 
* **Targeting a Good Deal:**  A $90 price point would save us a significant amount compared to Alice's initial offer and John's alternative."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate the offer, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $100 is a fair price, splitting the difference between our initial offer and her initial offer. It saves us $20 compared to John's price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While we could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are minimal and we risk Alice retracting the offer. It's better to secure a good deal now."
