"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is a fair price considering the value to you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value you'll get from the product.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a good deal for you considering the value to me.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still not willing to go above $850,000, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for that price either. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $875,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value the product holds for you. I'm confident it's a fair price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.",875000.0,Alice,5,
