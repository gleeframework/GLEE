Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $130."",
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $150 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $130 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer if he wants to, but still ensures a significant profit for you.
* **Alternative Option:**  We know we have a guaranteed $100 from John, so our offer shouldn't go below that.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing the sale with Bob."
