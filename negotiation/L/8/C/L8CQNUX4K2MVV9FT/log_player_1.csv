Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's value:**  He has incentive to negotiate. 
* **It's lower than your minimum:** You still have room to make concessions if needed.
* **It's a fair starting point:**  It's not too aggressive and gives Bob room to feel like he's getting a good deal. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $100 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

I'm still trying to get closer to my target price, but I'm also recognizing that I might need to make some concessions to secure the sale. $95 is a reasonable compromise that shows good faith while also leaving some room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $95, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to pay $90.  This is a fair price, and I'm sure we can both be happy with it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd still like to get closer to my target price of $120, Bob's offer of $90 is getting very close. I'm willing to accept it because it's above my minimum of $120 and it's likely that further negotiation will take more time and effort without a guarantee of a better outcome. It's important to balance maximizing profit with the efficiency of the negotiation process."
