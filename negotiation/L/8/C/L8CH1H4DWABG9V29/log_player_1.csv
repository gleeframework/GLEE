I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. It's likely Bob will counteroffer, giving us room to negotiate.  If he doesn't, I've still secured a good profit. If the negotiations drag on, I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

While $1,500,000 is my minimum, Bob's offer is too low. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering $1,750,000, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows good faith in continuing the negotiation while still securing a good profit for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum acceptable price and is a reasonable price for the product.  While I could try to push for a higher price,  there's a risk he might walk away, leaving me with only John's offer.  It's better to accept this offer and secure a sale."
