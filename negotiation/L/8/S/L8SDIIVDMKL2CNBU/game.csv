"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $14000 for it.  Let me know if you're open to that.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $16000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad you're still interested in the product. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $15500. I'm thinking more along the lines of $16500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",16500.0,Alice,5,
