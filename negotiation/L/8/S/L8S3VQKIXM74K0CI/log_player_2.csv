"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $110. I think it's a great deal for you considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can get the product for $120 from John, so you should try to negotiate with Alice to get a better price.  Rejecting her offer allows you to counter and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to purchase the product for $95.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm aiming for something a little closer to my initial price. How about we meet in the middle at $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to $105, which is closer to your target price of $95. Accepting the offer saves you $15 compared to buying from John.  It's a good deal considering the potential for continued negotiation."
