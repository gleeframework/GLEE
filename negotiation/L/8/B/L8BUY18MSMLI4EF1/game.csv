"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,100,000 price point. I am willing to offer $950,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your valuation.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget constraints.  However, the value this product brings to the table is significant, and $950,000 falls short of what I can accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ let's settle on $1,025,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's worth.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
