Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This allows room for negotiation while still securing a profitable deal for me.
* **Positive Framing:** The message is positive and open to discussion, encouraging Bob to engage.
* **Strategic Back-Up:**  I'm reminding Bob that I have another buyer willing to pay my minimum price, giving him an incentive to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.**  Accepting this offer would result in a significant loss. 
* **I have a backup buyer (John) willing to pay my minimum price.** This gives me leverage to negotiate further.
* **Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable price.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is simply too low for me. However, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's still a good deal for you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm not accepting Bob's low offer, but I'm also not sticking to my initial asking price. This shows flexibility while still protecting my interests.
* **Highlight value for Bob:**  I'm reminding Bob that even at $1,000,000, the product is still worth more to him than what he's offering.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message remains open to further discussion, encouraging Bob to make a counteroffer if he's still interested."
