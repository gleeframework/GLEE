"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that said, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a little steep for me right now.  Would you consider $1,000,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects its value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
