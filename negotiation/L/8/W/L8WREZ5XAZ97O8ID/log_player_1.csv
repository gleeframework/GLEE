"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $180.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a high price, $180, to leave room for negotiation. It's also important to give Bob a reason to buy, so I'm highlighting the value of the product.  I'm eager to see if he's interested!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I'm going to try to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $120 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $150.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 
 
I'm lowering my price to $150, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm also emphasizing my desire to find a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm happy to hear you're willing to negotiate.  $150 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $135? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $135 is a good compromise and significantly better than selling to John for $120.  It's time to close the deal!"
