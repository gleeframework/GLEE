"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $11,000. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you is $10,000. I'm willing to make a slight discount for you, but I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,000 is less than her product's value to her, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John.  Rejecting this offer opens the door to getting a better deal."
