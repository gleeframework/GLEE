"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll really love. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than both your budget and John's price. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $150 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counter-offer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still within a reasonable negotiation range. It leaves room to work upwards while signaling that the initial offer was too high.
* **Polite and Open:** The message aims to be respectful and suggests that I'm genuinely interested in the product but need a more affordable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $100 is a bit too low for me.  Could you do $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but $130 is still above both your budget and John's price. It's worth seeing if you can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $115?"",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counter-offer shows willingness to move from my initial offer and encourages Alice to do the same. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** $115 is a strong position - it's a fair compromise, still below my budget, and a significant saving compared to Alice's last offer. It also leaves a small window for a final concession if needed."
