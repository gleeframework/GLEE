"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1300000 is simply too low for me.  I understand your budget constraints, but this product is worth significantly more to both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
