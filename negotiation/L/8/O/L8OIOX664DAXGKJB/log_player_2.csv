Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I still need to make a decent profit. How about we meet in the middle again? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $108.  While we could try to negotiate further, we risk her sticking to her price or even increasing it slightly. Accepting $108 secures a reasonable deal and avoids the risk of having to buy from John for $120."
