"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,001. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,001
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is close to her minimum, it's still above your maximum. You have room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal. It's always worth trying to negotiate before resorting to Plan B (buying from John)."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer that's well below Alice's asking price. This establishes a clear starting point for negotiation. There's a significant gap between our prices, which allows for room to compromise and reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum price of $1,500,000. I will continue to negotiate with Alice, as there is still potential for a better deal.  Even though John's offer is higher than Alice's current offer, I am willing to take the risk of negotiating further with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer to $1,250,000. This is a significant increase from my previous counteroffer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise. It's still below Alice's current price, and closer to her minimum price of $1,200,000, increasing the chances of reaching an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is still higher than my maximum budget of $1,500,000. Further negotiation is unlikely to lead to a better deal. Therefore, it's more cost-effective to buy the product from John at his fixed price, even though it's slightly higher than Alice's offer."
