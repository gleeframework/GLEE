"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. This is a great deal, considering its value to me is no less than $1500000. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $800000. I appreciate your understanding and hope we can come to an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $800000 is a bit below my minimum price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1200000. This is a fair compromise considering the value I place on the product. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the compromise, I'm still unable to meet at $1200000 due to my financial constraints. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial solution.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $900000 is still a bit below my minimum price, but I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1100000. This is as close as I can get to my minimum price, considering the value I place on the product. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your continued willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate your efforts to meet my budgetary constraints. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1000000. This brings us even closer to a mutually agreeable price, while still respecting the value I place on the product.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
