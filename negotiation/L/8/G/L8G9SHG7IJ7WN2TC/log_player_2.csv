"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's target of $1,000,000. It's worth exploring if a lower price is possible through negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for the absolute lowest price possible. He knows he can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so this is his starting point. There's a chance Alice might accept this offer, especially considering she values the product higher. If she rejects, Bob can continue negotiating downwards in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target, it's still above his preferred price.  There's a good chance Alice is willing to go lower to secure the deal.  Bob is likely to get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is playing it safe. He's moving in smaller increments now, aiming to meet Alice halfway. A $1,025,000 offer shows good faith while still keeping the price below his fallback option. He's hoping Alice, who wants the deal, will accept this compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is showing resistance to dropping her price below $1,050,000. Bob has already made multiple concessions and there are only 5 rounds remaining.  While he could continue negotiating, the risk of not reaching an agreement and losing the chance to buy from John is increasing.  Buying from John guarantees the product at Bob's target price and avoids further potential negotiation headaches."
