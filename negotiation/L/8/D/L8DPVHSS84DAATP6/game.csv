"Hello Alice, thanks for showing me the product.  While I agree it looks great, $180 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $180 might be a bit high for you, Bob. However, I still think the product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $140. It's a fair price considering its value to you.",140.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not comfortable going below $130, Bob. I think the product's value is worth more than that. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $130. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to you.",130.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price, but I have a hard limit at $120.  If you're willing to meet that price, I'm ready to buy today. Otherwise, I need to consider other options.",120.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is your hard limit, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I've already come down significantly from my initial offer, and I think the product's value is worth more than that. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $125. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept.",125.0,Alice,7,
