"I'm really interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9500 for it. Can we meet in the middle?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $11000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $8000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
