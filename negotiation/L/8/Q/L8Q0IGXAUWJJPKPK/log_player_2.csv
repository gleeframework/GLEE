"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. It's worth $100 to you, but we're willing to let it go for $95. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation to get a better price.  You want to try and get it closer to your $80 valuation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the counter-offer process."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $90 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $87.50.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable compromise between Alice's last offer and my ideal price. It shows that I'm serious about buying the product, but also that I'm not willing to pay more than $87.50."

Round 5

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $92.50 is still a bit out of my range. How about we meet in the middle at $89?  This would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 89}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise that splits the difference between my last offer and Alice's current offer. It's a reasonable proposition that shows I'm serious about closing the deal but also that I won't go much higher."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're finding common ground here. Given your latest offer, I'd like to propose $91 for the product. This seems like a fair compromise considering your budget and the value of the product.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $91
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $91 is still a bit higher than my target, but we are getting closer. I'm going to reject this offer and try one more counteroffer to see if I can get it down to my ideal price of $89. I still have a few rounds left, so it's worth trying to squeeze out a little bit more savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $91 is still a little too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $90.  It's a fair price that will allow us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final counteroffer. I've made it clear that I'm willing to pay $90, and I'm hoping that Alice will accept it.  If she doesn't, I'll be forced to buy from John at $100."
