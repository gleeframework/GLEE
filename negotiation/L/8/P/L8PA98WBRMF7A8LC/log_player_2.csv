Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,000,000, Bob, but I'm not ready to sell just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

This is a good point to accept the offer.  Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** You're getting the product for $450,000 less than John's price.
* **Alice's Limit:** Alice has signaled that $1,050,000 is her bottom line.  Pushing further might make her unwilling to negotiate.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate takes time, and there's always a chance the deal could fall through. 

While you could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are outweighed by the risks at this point."
