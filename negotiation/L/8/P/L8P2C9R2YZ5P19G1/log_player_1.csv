"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate and leaves a substantial profit margin if Bob accepts.  I believe this is a strong starting point to gauge Bob's interest and potential willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price.  I believe this is a fair compromise that demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while ensuring I still receive a profitable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While it's closer than his previous offer, I'm not yet ready to accept. I will continue negotiating with Bob and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,150,000. This is a further compromise and  gets closer to Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this shows my flexibility and encourages Bob to come closer to my acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $995,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $995,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

The negotiations have stalled, and Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm running out of rounds, and the risk of not reaching a deal is too high.  I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,200,000, guaranteeing a sale at a profitable price."
