"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product at a special price. I think you'll really like it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer is way too high.  It's worth $100 to you and she's offering it at $180. You're better off either making a counteroffer or going straight to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $180 is a bit steep for me.  I'm happy to pay $100 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $180 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice has come down a little, but $140 is still too high. You are willing to pay $100 and John is selling it for that price. It makes sense to continue negotiating or to go straight to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $140 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm sticking with my offer of $100.  Let me know if you're willing to do that."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get a bit hesitant to go any lower, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

While $125 is closer to your desired price, you've already established that you're willing to pay $100 and John is offering it for that price.  There's no reason to keep negotiating with Alice when you have a guaranteed deal with John."
