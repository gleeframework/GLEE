Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. I'm willing to compromise at $9,750, but I'll throw in a bonus feature that's worth an extra $250. That way, you'll get even more value out of the product. The new price is $10,000, which is still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is trying to dress up her price increase by adding a ""bonus feature"".  It's clear she's not going to go below $10,000. Since you can get the product from John at that price without further negotiation, it makes sense to buy from John and avoid potentially wasting more time with Alice."
