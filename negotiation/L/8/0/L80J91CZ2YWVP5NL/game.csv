"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $7,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? I'm confident you'll see a great return on this investment.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,000. This is my final offer, and if we can't agree, I'll be forced to look elsewhere.",8000.0,Bob,4,
