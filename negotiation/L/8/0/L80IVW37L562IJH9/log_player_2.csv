"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,000 is too far below my value. How about $11,000? This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product for you while allowing me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,500 is closer, but it's still a bit below where I need to be.  How about $11,500?  This would split the difference between our last offers and give us both a good deal.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.
