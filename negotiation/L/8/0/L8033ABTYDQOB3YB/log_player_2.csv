"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to make a one-time offer to you, and I think you'll find it very attractive. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and $1,200,000 is significantly above his budget of $800,000. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your best price, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially reach a price closer to his limit."

I believe this is a fair offer considering we're both looking for a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and I think it's a fair one. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's worth to you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer of $1,050,000 is lower than her previous offers, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to negotiate a price closer to his limit or choose to buy from John.  There's a chance that Alice might be willing to go lower, especially if she wants to finalize the deal."
