Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so this is your ""walk-away"" point.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's no overlap between your minimum and Bob's maximum. Any deal needs to bridge this gap.

**Strategy**

Since there's no ZOPA based on the current valuations, you have two main options:

1. **High Anchor, Hope for the Best:**  Start with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping he might be willing to stretch his budget or values the product more than he's letting on. 

2. **Go with John:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at your minimum, you could bypass negotiations with Bob entirely.

**The Offer (Option 1: High Anchor)**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its exceptional features and market potential, I'm confident it's worth significantly more in the right hands. I'm proposing a price of $1,700,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** The message emphasizes the product's value and exclusivity.
* **High Anchor:** $1,700,000 sets a high starting point, potentially prompting Bob to counter-offer within a range closer to your desired price.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** Mentioning other interested parties creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly.

**Important Considerations**

* **Relationship:**  If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial, a softer approach might be better, even if it means going straight to John.
* **Information is Power:** Is there any chance Bob might be willing to pay more than $1,200,000?  Gathering more information about his needs and motivations could change your approach.
