"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,050,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's a fair price given its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice first. There's potential to save money by rejecting the initial offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit steep for me. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $950,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $950,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,000,000? This way, we both get a fair deal, and I can move on to finalize the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Alice is now offering the product for $1,000,000, which is the same price as John. Since there is no potential to save more money by continuing negotiations, it's best to accept Alice's offer."
