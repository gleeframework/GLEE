"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but I'm going to have to counter with a price of $1050000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I see in the product.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. However, I was hoping to get a bit closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1250000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1250000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1100000. This is a fair price, and it allows for both of us to make a profit. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, Bob. However, I still need to consider my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $1300000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
