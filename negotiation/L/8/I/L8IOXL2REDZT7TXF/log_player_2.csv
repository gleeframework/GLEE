"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe you'll find it a worthwhile investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a good starting point for a counteroffer. You can potentially save more money by negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but I'm going to have to counter with a price of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I see in the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, demonstrating your desire to negotiate a better price.
* **Fairness:** While it's a lower price than what Alice offered, it's still above her valuation of $1,000,000, which means there's still room for a potential agreement.
* **Openness:** The message maintains a positive and open tone, inviting further discussion and negotiation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. However, I was hoping to get a bit closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1250000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than what I'm comfortable paying, even though it's a compromise. There's still room for negotiation, and I'm not willing to pay more than $1,100,000 at this point. I'll try a counteroffer again to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, Bob. However, I still need to consider my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $1300000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for my comfort level.  While it's lower than her initial offer, it's getting closer to my maximum budget, and I'm not confident we'll be able to close the gap further.  At this point, it's more efficient to buy the product from John for $1,500,000. It guarantees the purchase, and while it's not the ideal price, it's within my budget."
