"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in.  My asking price is $18000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $10,000. It's in my best interest to reject and counteroffer to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $18,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, but I'm not sure I can go any higher."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to at least get $14000 for this product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While $14,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above my desired price point. I'll reject and counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to $10,000.  I have several rounds left and I'm not desperate enough to accept this offer yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to get a certain price, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $12,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 12000}
