Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I know you'll be happy with it.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This price is higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate but still allows me to make a profit. 
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 

By offering this price, I'm trying to maximize my profit while still keeping the possibility of a sale with Bob. If he rejects, I can always sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
