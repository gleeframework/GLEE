"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I'm happy to start the negotiations at $1,500,000. I believe this price reflects the true value and potential of what I'm offering."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advantageous to start with an offer higher than your desired selling price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's willingness to pay.
* **Anchoring:** By starting high, we ""anchor"" the negotiation around a higher value, potentially influencing Bob to make a counteroffer closer to our desired range.
* **Preserving Value:** While we know John offers $1,200,000, settling for that immediately undermines the negotiation process. We want to explore if Bob is willing to pay more.

This initial offer allows us to gather information about Bob's position and adjust our strategy in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches John's guaranteed price, we still have room to negotiate. Accepting $1,200,000 in Round 2 would be settling too early, especially since we started high. We want to see if we can push Bob closer to our desired range before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  This product offers unique value that I believe justifies a higher price point. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility, but Stand Firm:**  We acknowledge Bob's counteroffer but signal that it's too low. By proposing a price exactly in the middle, we demonstrate a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher selling point. 
* **Justify the Value:**  We reiterate the product's unique value to reinforce the reason behind our price.
* **Maintain Momentum:**  We want to keep the negotiation moving, and proposing a specific counteroffer encourages a response from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a higher price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,300,000. How about we meet in the middle of our previous offer at $1,325,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** Bob has moved considerably closer to our desired range, indicating a strong interest in the product.
* **Diminishing Returns:** While we could try to push for a slightly higher price, the potential gains are shrinking, and we risk alienating Bob. 
* **Time Value:**  We've spent four rounds negotiating, and accepting now secures a significant profit above John's offer. Delaying further might not yield proportionally better results. 

Accepting $1,325,000 represents a successful negotiation outcome where we've maximized profit within a reasonable timeframe."
