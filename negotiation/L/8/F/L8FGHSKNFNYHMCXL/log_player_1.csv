Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. While it's worth at least $1,500,000 to me, I'm willing to offer it to you for a significantly reduced price. Consider this a special opportunity.  Let's talk about a price of $1,200,000.  It's a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offer Price:**  $1,200,000 is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than my minimum value ($1,500,000) but still leaves me with a profit.
* **Message:** The message emphasizes the value of the product to Bob, highlights the discounted price as a special opportunity, and makes it clear that this is a fair deal for both parties. This approach aims to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously.

**Why this strategy is effective:**

* **Maximizes profit:**  This offer allows for a good profit while keeping the product competitive for Bob. 
* **Negotiation potential:** The message sets the stage for negotiation if Bob wants to counter-offer.  I can then adjust the price based on the situation.
* **Back-up plan:**  Even if Bob rejects, I have John as a guaranteed buyer at a higher price, ensuring I don't lose out on significant value."
