"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. It's valued at $1200000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. My starting price is $1000000. This price reflects the product's significant value and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's discuss this further and find a price that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is still a bit high for me.  Considering the value to both of us, I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This price allows for a reasonable profit for you while remaining within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I understand your perspective. While $850000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. Let's compromise. I'm willing to lower my price to $950000, which is a significant concession from my initial offer. I believe this price reflects the value of the product and provides you with a fair deal. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $900000? This would be a fair deal for both of us and allow us to finalize this transaction quickly.",900000.0,Bob,4,
