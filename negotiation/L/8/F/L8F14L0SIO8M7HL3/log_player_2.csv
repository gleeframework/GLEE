"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. It's valued at $1200000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. My starting price is $1000000. This price reflects the product's significant value and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's discuss this further and find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I understand your perspective. While $850000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. Let's compromise. I'm willing to lower my price to $950000, which is a significant concession from my initial offer. I believe this price reflects the value of the product and provides you with a fair deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

While Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, you can still potentially do better.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially secure a price closer to your initial counteroffer of $850,000."
