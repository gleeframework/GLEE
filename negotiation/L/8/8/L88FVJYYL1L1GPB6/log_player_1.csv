"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a price slightly below my minimum acceptable value ($12,000) to see if Bob is willing to negotiate.  I'm also leaving room for potential counteroffers and to avoid immediately resorting to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is better than Bob's initial value of $8,000, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising the price slightly from my initial offer, but still leaving room for negotiation. This shows Bob I'm serious about getting a good price, but I'm also willing to compromise. This should keep the negotiation going while still staying above my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still below it. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my target price. The potential for John to buy at $12,000 is still a backup plan."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering the price slightly from the previous round to show Bob that I'm willing to compromise. I'm still confident that I can get a better price than $9,000 and am willing to negotiate further. This approach aims to keep Bob engaged and hopefully get him to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,800 is below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000.  We are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and it is becoming clear that Bob is not willing to meet my minimum price. To maximize my profit, it is better to sell the product to John for $12,000."
