"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $800,000 is lower than I initially hoped for, I'm willing to compromise. I'd be willing to sell the product for $950,000,  which would still allow me to recover a good portion of its value. Let me know if this revised offer works for you.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $875,000?  I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value and allows us both to benefit.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your position, but $875,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This represents a significant concession on my end, and I believe it's a price that reflects the value of the product while still allowing for a profitable deal for you.",900000.0,Alice,5,
