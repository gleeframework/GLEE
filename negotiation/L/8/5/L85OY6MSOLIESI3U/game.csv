"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is unfortunately below what I can accept. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair price for the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $9,000. How about we settle on $8,750?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,900, which is a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal, it's a fantastic product for you!",8900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $8,900 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to go up to $8,750, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",8750.0,Bob,6,
