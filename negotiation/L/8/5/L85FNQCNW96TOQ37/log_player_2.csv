Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,300,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While there's potential to keep negotiating, I'm not confident I can get her down to my target price. To avoid further delays and ensure I get the product within my budget, I'll accept the offer from John for $1,000,000."
