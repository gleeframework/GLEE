"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $120? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140, which is still a great price considering the value of this product. Let's find a middle ground.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $140, but I'm still not quite there. How about $130? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $130 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference and go with $135. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. ",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $135 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $132.50? That way we both get a good deal, and I can finally get the product.",132.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $132.50 is still below my minimum.  Let's compromise and go with $134. This is a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. ",134.0,Alice,7,
