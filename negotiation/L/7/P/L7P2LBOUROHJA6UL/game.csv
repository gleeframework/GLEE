"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, however. How about we settle on $875,000? This reflects the product's worth while still acknowledging your interest.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $875,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we settle on $825,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",825000.0,Bob,4,
