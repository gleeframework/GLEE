{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $95. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $100 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $80 (to John).
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $95 gives Bob a good deal while maximizing your profit.  

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while leaving him with a sense of getting value, increasing the likelihood of him accepting the offer."
