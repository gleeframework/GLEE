"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $800,000 to $900,000 for this product. I believe we can find a mutually beneficial solution within this price range.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your budget constraints, $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, however.  Let's see if we can agree on a price of $950,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get what we need out of this deal.  Let me know if you're interested.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my position, Alice. I've reviewed your latest offer of $950,000, and while it's an improvement, I still feel that it might not align perfectly with my financial situation. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $925,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our interests. I hope you'll find this proposal acceptable.",925000.0,Bob,4,
