``` 

This is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.  If he rejects, I can lower the price slightly, but I'll be ready to walk away and sell to John if Bob doesn't come closer to my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $800,000 to $900,000 for this product. I believe we can find a mutually beneficial solution within this price range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to let him take advantage of me. I'll counteroffer and see if he's serious about a deal. If not, I'll walk away and sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your budget constraints, $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, however.  Let's see if we can agree on a price of $950,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get what we need out of this deal.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my position, Alice. I've reviewed your latest offer of $950,000, and while it's an improvement, I still feel that it might not align perfectly with my financial situation. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $925,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our interests. I hope you'll find this proposal acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $925,000 is still below my desired minimum, it's close enough to warrant acceptance.  Further negotiation could drag this on, and I'm not convinced I'll be able to get much more from Bob.  It's also likely that John might decide to pull out of the deal if he sees me dragging my feet.  $925,000 is a decent profit, and I can always reinvest that money to try and achieve a higher return in the future."
