{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $1,100,000. I believe this product would be highly beneficial to you, and this offer is a unique opportunity to acquire it."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While we have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000 (John), there's a chance to earn more if Bob is willing to pay above his perceived value.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 creates a significant profit margin while still being potentially attractive to Bob. It sits comfortably between Bob's value ($800,000) and our minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob counters. It allows us to gauge his interest level and adjust accordingly while ensuring we don't sell for less than John's offer.

This strategy aims to balance profit maximization with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
