Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your final offer, Alice. I appreciate your transparency. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,125,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000

While a higher price is ideal, Bob is unlikely to budge much beyond his $1,125,000 offer. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit over John's $800,000 and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
