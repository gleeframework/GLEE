{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000.  I think it's a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for potential bargaining.  It also expresses confidence in the product's worth while leaving the door open for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.**  Selling to Bob at his offer would be a loss for me.
* **I still have the option to sell to John for $15,000, which is my minimum.** This provides a safety net if the negotiation with Bob fails. 
* **Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired value.** This gives me more leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer, but $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $14,000? This is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $13000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, so I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is now closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.**  While it's still below my ideal, it's a significant improvement from his previous offer.
* **The risk of further negotiation is high.** There's no guarantee that I can push Bob higher, and I risk losing him as a buyer altogether. 
* **Selling to John for $15,000 is still an option, but accepting Bob's offer at $13,000 is a faster and less risky decision.** It secures a sale at a price that is relatively close to my minimum."
