"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer, but $12000 is unfortunately too low for me.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $14000? This is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $13000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, so I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle.",13000.0,Bob,4,
