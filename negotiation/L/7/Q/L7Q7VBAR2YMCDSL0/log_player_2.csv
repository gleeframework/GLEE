"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is better than Alice's initial value of $12,000, Bob can still do better. He has the option of buying from John for $10,000, so there's room for negotiation with Alice. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get as close to his maximum budget as possible.  He knows John is selling for $10,000, so offering $10,500 is a good starting point. This shows Alice he's serious about buying but also willing to walk away if she's not flexible. It's a reasonable compromise that might be appealing to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. He knows he can get the product for $10,000 from John, so there's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice.  The risk of further negotiation might lead to a higher price, and Bob doesn't want to risk going over his budget.  Buying from John guarantees him the product at his desired price."
