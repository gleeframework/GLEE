{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're looking to save as much money as possible.  $6,000 is a good price, but there's still room to negotiate. By rejecting the offer, you can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you want to save as much as possible, a counteroffer of $5,000 is a reasonable starting point. It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for potential compromise.  It's also a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is a bit higher than your initial counteroffer, but it's still less than her initial offer. There's still room for negotiation.  You should reject and see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer was higher than your first counteroffer but still lower than her initial offer.  You should try to meet her halfway with a counteroffer of $5,500. This shows you're willing to negotiate while still aiming for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $6,750 is a lower price than what Alice offered previously, you're still closer to your target price.  There's still a good chance you can negotiate further and get a lower price. It's worth rejecting to see if you can get closer to your goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice keeps increasing her offer, but it's still not at your target price. You need to push harder. A counteroffer of $6,000 is a good compromise. It's closer to Alice's offer but still below your maximum spending limit. This shows you're serious about buying the product but are not willing to pay an inflated price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to your maximum price, but it's still not a good deal. You're running out of rounds. At this point, it's safer to buy from John, as you're guaranteed to get the product within your budget. There's no guarantee that Alice will accept a counteroffer, and you risk losing the product altogether."
