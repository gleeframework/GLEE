"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product, which I believe will be highly valuable to your business.  My asking price is $1,400,000.

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, and I'm interested in making a deal. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe it's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your interest. While your offer is tempting, $1,200,000 doesn't quite meet my minimum value for the product. To show my commitment to reaching an agreement, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This price still provides you with significant value, and allows me to achieve a fair return on my investment. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,300,000. I'm thinking of $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
