"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. That's the most I'm willing to pay for the product.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $700,000 is unfortunately below what I can accept.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is a good price for both of us, as it's still lower than my initial offer and closer to your desired price. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $700,000 and $800,000, so I'll offer $750,000. That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so my final offer is $800,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. I'm confident you'll find this to be a good value for your investment.",800000.0,Alice,5,
