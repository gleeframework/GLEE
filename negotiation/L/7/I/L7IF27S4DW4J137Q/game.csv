"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product goes beyond the current market estimations. It offers unique advantages that justify a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I still think $1,075,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. I'm very motivated to see this product in the right hands, and I understand the importance of finding a price that works for both of us. Let's try this - $1,050,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, demonstrating my commitment to making this deal happen.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad to see you're motivated to make a deal. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $1,025,000. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems like we are very close to a price that works for both of us.  I respect your position and I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,040,000. I believe this is my final offer, and I hope it demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.",1040000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, $1,040,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,030,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm starting to get concerned that we might not meet in the middle, so I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",1030000.0,Bob,8,
