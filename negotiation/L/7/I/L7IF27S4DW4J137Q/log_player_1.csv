Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad to see you're motivated to make a deal. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $1,025,000. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly very interested in the product and is inching closer to a more reasonable price.  He's also revealed his likely top price ($1,025,000).  We are still early enough in the negotiation to push for a slightly better outcome."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, it seems like we are very close to a price that works for both of us.  I respect your position and I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,040,000. I believe this is my final offer, and I hope it demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1040000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:** This message conveys a sense of firmness while still leaving room for a deal. By stating it's your final offer, you add a level of seriousness.
* **Small concession:**  Coming down by $10,000 is a small concession but shows you're willing to move.
* **Time pressure:** With fewer rounds left, Bob will feel the pressure to make a decision."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, $1,040,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,030,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm starting to get concerned that we might not meet in the middle, so I hope we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,030,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Bob has consistently inched up his offer, indicating strong interest. We've effectively negotiated him halfway between his initial offer and our starting point.
* **Time constraint:** With only two rounds left, the risk of Bob walking away increases. Accepting now secures a significant profit.
* **Opportunity cost:** While John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, the difference is now relatively small compared to the risk of continuing and potentially ending up with nothing.

By accepting Bob's offer of $1,030,000, we secure a $30,000 profit over his initial offer and avoid the risk of losing the sale altogether."
