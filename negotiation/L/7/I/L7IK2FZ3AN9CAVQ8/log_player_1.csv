Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $20,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$20,000:** This is a starting point that is higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. It's important to start high, as I can always go lower later. 
* **Message:**  I've kept the message brief and positive, highlighting the product's value.  This sets a friendly tone for negotiation.

**Why this approach?**

* **Starting high:** It gives me more negotiating power and allows me to potentially earn more.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  It shows I'm open to a deal and willing to compromise.
* **Focus on the product's value:** This can help Bob understand the potential worth of the product.

**Important Notes:**

* I will be monitoring Bob's response carefully and adjusting my strategy based on his counteroffers.
* I will be prepared to accept a lower price if necessary, but I won't go below my minimum value of $15,000.
* I'm also ready to switch to John if the negotiation with Bob doesn't yield a favorable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. Could you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer more, it's not worth risking a longer negotiation that might lead to a lower price or a failed deal. Accepting his offer ensures a quick and secure sale."
