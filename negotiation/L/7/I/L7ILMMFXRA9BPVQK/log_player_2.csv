"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal value of $8,000.  There's room to negotiate further, so rejecting the initial offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. Would you be willing to consider $8,500? I'm confident this price reflects the value of the product for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,750. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's ideal price of $8,000.  While $8,750 is still slightly higher, it's a reasonable compromise.  Continuing to negotiate risks the possibility of Alice rejecting further counteroffers or Bob running out of rounds. Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product at a price that's within his budget and is closer to his ideal value."
