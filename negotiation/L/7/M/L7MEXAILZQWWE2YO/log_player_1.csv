{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $135. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer starts by emphasizing the value for Bob, aiming to get him interested. $135 is a good starting point as it's above Bob's value but leaves room for negotiation if needed. It's important to remember that I have a backup buyer, which gives me more leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $135 is a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $100 is more than Bob's value of $120, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $150. I'll reject this offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $100 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $125. This price still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to get for this product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about $110? That's a fair price and it fits into my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $110 is a little closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm willing to walk away and sell to John for $150. It's more profitable for me in the long run."
