"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to an agreement on a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is still a great deal for you, given the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this price.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $925,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product and our negotiation so far.",925000.0,Bob,4,
