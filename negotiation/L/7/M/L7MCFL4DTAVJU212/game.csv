"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1100000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $1050000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1080000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm looking to get out of the deal. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1080000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position.  I'm still a bit hesitant about $1080000. Would you be willing to consider $1060000?  That would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal at that price.",1060000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1070000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm looking to get out of the deal. Let's see if we can seal the deal at this price.",1070000.0,Alice,5,
